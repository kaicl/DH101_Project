    "We studied how to extract information from textual materials in class. I wonder if we can do the same with videos. I'm interested to see if we can apply the tools we learned in class to uncover hidden insights from YouTube videos and comments. I believe that the emotions expressed in people’s comments strongly correlate with the likelihood of purchasing a product and can predict market trends. For this project, I am going to compare script and comments from the top five most viewed Youtube videos reviews on the newly released iPad pro with M4 chip. \n",

       "'3.9 million views. We paid for this video by views alone. Imma hop on CODM with this MF 😂😂😂 Dude ipad software is even worse than macbook and even more limited Wait how much does this cost? that toothbrush scene was fascinating 😂 Wtf 3600$. I&#39;d rather upgrade my pc and the rest money, i&#39;ll buy an android What writing Tablet is the one u used? Really interesting take...I don&#39;t use my phone for anything if I can help it.  I even use my laptop to send texts because the tiny keyboard is useless to me.  When websites try to send me to apps, I get really annoyed.  And of course, this is Apple...I won&#39;t use apple products if I can help it.  Unless you are doing video editing or graphic design, they are pretty useless. In my country there is 2200$ if you convert this into Kuwaiti dinar i swear😮😮 Wow Apple fans are a really really strange group of people... Why I have a 2 in 1 pc. Gets me all the advantages of a tablet, as a PC. The reality is I do a lot of coding and running various virtual machines, and all the applications I use work perfectly on PC. Are we just going to ignore the toothbrush at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Ok everything is fine but what brand or mpdel is ypur sweatshirt 😂 How do i get that Pokemon starter apple watch face? As someone who understands the technology,  I would obviously never buy an Apple product. But, as someone who understands profits over people, I&#39;ve bought a decent amount of Apple stock. So, I think apple is great and everyone should buy one. *2600 dollars My names Kade, a great videographer and photographer, here to tell you this will take up space in my inventory as a creator because I have a PC and MSI gaming laptop. I was here for the screen colors and debating if I wanted a iPhone color profile screen to edit photos on😂 not worth it to me. Okay how did I not know that writing tablets are a thing?????? I honestly prefer going to a website on my mobile devices compared to an app because storage management is something I really struggle with and websites barely take up any storage compared to the app. So did you take it on the aisle😂 3.47 If apple comes out with a foldable the size of the z fold = Game over. You spent 3600 bucks because you can afford it. We can’t. Prices are becoming obscene. But as long as there are people willing and able to pay them, there’s clearly a market for these super inflated prices. My ipad 2018 is stuck in boot loop. 😢😢😢😢😢<br>The price of ipad has sky rocketed. Arjun is becoming an I pad kid Bro literally convinced himself to buy the iPad For the large iPad Pro’s, Apple should be ashamed for not including a 30W charger. That was one of my very first purchases along with a 6 ft white extension cord Apple used to make for the Mac’s. The 6 foot white extension cord into the 30W Mac charging brick out to a 3 ft Amazon Basics braided USB-C cord is a must for conveniently staying charged while on the couch and a must accessory for traveling. I have an iPad Pro 12.9 5th Generation with 1 TB. I don’t see anything compelling enough to make a change. I have the keyboard case so the weight difference would be insignificant and the screen display would only be marginally better and I would be concerned about burn in. Imagine if the burn in was slightly different on the two layers. That would be a real mess. Where can I download those $3600 to me living in Indonesia doesn&#39;t sound all that expensive if an average wage earner earns just as low as $2000 in USA.<br><br>Here the price of a new iPhone could be 4-5x the low average wage worker here... Bro&#39;s video quality even on 360p on my phone🫡🫡❤ There is a sucker born every minute. That&#39;s apple for ya a rip off It could bend like paper and it’s battery could be 🐶💩 in comparison I think should have just packed it with a m3 like it may be that powerful but all you can do with that much power is play triple aaa games that only support m1 but there’s less than 10 games that actually require a m1 The iPad only 1568 I once had a hauwei smart phone and it was bent almost like a half circle and it still worked didn&#39;t lagg nothing In my country if i max out the ipad pro m4 it will cost 3.9k and that with tax included. That cost more then building a mid-range desktop and buying macbook pro or the air. Like wtf apple? This is not gonna replace macbooks my ass lol Your rich and they paid you ..sorry they suck and you know it Apple is the evil 😈 you have to pay so money subscription ! Who watches this guy?! Pass <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=345\">5:45</a> That whole segment was funny to me especially the “wow” 😂 Don’t get me wrong. This is a truly great device  and nothing like it.  I respectfully have to disagree with this video and amount spent on something like this. Good luck trying to make it work. This so called “work around” you are trying to pursue unless they change the concept of iPad OS will be a awful miserable  attempt coming from my experience of 2 years trying to make the iPad Pro 12.9 which I was glad to get rid of and change for a MacBook Air this year  at least for my use case as daily computer and logic. humans are intuitive we feel comfortable touching the screen ,using tablet keyboard,especially chilling out , harder to relax using a mac ,too clunky, can imaging people buying this to connect to their top spec imac and use with touch. people like to flex their cash on these products,unless you do loads of video editing or word processing,need loads of storage and like to do many things while waiting on videos processing it’s a hell of a lot of cash ,plush you’ll need pencil pro ,new keypad/case , if you need it for work and can use it for leisure fair enough if you need to upgrade, never worked out how dollar price equals pound price Product price $3,600<br>What customers get<br>USB 2.0 480 Mbps<br>Battery 10,290 mAh<br>20W USB-C adapter actually receives 35W.<br>$3,600!!!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 With 18.8M subs he either git the ipad for free or hes banking.  I only imagine the car he drives. Why you started mimic of Marques brownlee? I spent less money on my gaming beast PC than this tiny little screen would cost. What a scam. With the newest advancements in chipsets and tech, I want a 17&quot; tablet that is faster and more powerful than my current 2022 Dell XPS 9710. I also want a laptop style keyboard dock, which has a built-in extra battery supply for the tablet to add use time. The tablet would need to have a couple Thunderbolt 4 ports so I can connect a USB hub and drives, an extra monitor, and supply power. Oh, and I definitely want it to be not an Apple. I feel like you converted the nearly £2900 of your specced iPad to dollars just to make the video sound extra &quot;clickable&quot;, like &quot;$3000&quot; didn&#39;t sound catchy enough, so you had to stretch it to $3600.<br><br>The iPad Pro 11 inch and 13 inch costs £999 / £1299 respectively in the UK. In the US, they cost $999 / $1299.<br><br>Your £2877 iPad Pro costs $2877 in the US. I understand that you want the currency in the title to be widely understood, but adding an over $600 markup doesn&#39;t make sense here.<br><br>And yes, you could say &quot;I&#39;m only converting it to dollars to the viewers have an accurate idea as to how much I ACTUALLY paid in my currency when converted&quot;, but that logic also wouldn&#39;t make sense here. If I were to buy an iPad Pro in Denmark with the same configuration that you selected, I&#39;d be paying 29297 Danish Kroner. When converted to dollars, I get $4271. Buying a max spec iPad Pro in Denmark costs an additional $1394 when compared to the US.<br><br>So in some other Universe, a Danish MrWhoseTheBoss could title their video &quot;Why I spent $4271 on the iPad Pro M4.&quot; And while they wouldn&#39;t be wrong when talking about how much they paid in their currency when converted to dollars, Denmark has less than 0.02% the population the US does, so talking about the iPad Pro&#39;s cost in Danish Kroner doesn&#39;t make sense to your viewers who would be paying $1400 LESS for the EXACT same machine.<br><br>Even the UK only has 20% the population the US does, so it really isn&#39;t fair to talk about the cost of the iPad using British Pounds, as if you convert the currency you end up tacking an extra $600 onto the cost out of nowhere. I feel that next time, if you want to use dollars in your title to describe the cost of something you bought to your main audience (US viewers), you should get the figure based on how much the item costs in the US instead of how much you actually paid, and then converting.<br><br>It&#39;s more work, but it&#39;s more honest, and I feel like that&#39;s more important than making the video sound extra clickable. Can you do a video on iPad Air It’s just like a Vision Pro for your hands, hahaha Good evening are you doing anything with the Xiaomi Mix Fold 4? good advertisment for ipad I think this a solid buy if you don’t already have a laptop or computer. This is solid for maybe like a designer or artist of some sort but for daily use it seems way more cumbersome (ironic bc it’s so thin) but I’d rather use the laptop where it feels all together where this device is like holding the worst part of a MacBook. Like I dunno iPads are cool for legit drawing and watching stuff. 3600 is like a 2010 Prius lol Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. No one get to the Father except through him. DO A GIVE AWAWY IF YIU WANNA BEAT THE APPLE Tbf its got less ports which i think is important. 1. i dont like trackpads, 2. I do actully use the HDMI and Ethernet ports. I also find that for most people who are gamees they are probably not gaming on a Mac, a PC or Linux machine would do you better since more stuff is designed to work on those, it even feels like steam cares more about Linux than Mac at this point Perfect use of ‘filthy casual’ as long as people like you keeps buying it with that price, they won&#39;t integrate MacOS and iPadOS, never. Most overrated tech youtuber who doesn&#39;t know bs about tech Because you have $3600 to spend on it That pencil is in the perfect place to be stolen and it is expensive so that makes it even more appealing. And the iPad could probably just slip out of your hand and fall or get taken by a thief. And just 3 weeks later, he wants Them to fix it I thought @Mrwhosetheboss was in the UK??

My old iPad runs longer than the new one so bring a battery as far as the blacks in the detail of the screens I bought the top of the line, sony OLED and it’s better than my $5000 TV so now I find myself watching movies in my iPad and tv off in the background and the iPad in my lap&gt; I don&#39;t like your review at all because it&#39;s not fun to talk too much Apple is a 🤡 can you post a link where you got the writing tablet from please?

Next video: “Why I returned my $3600 iPad” Would love to hear your view on the upcoming Windows Surface Pro 11. I&#39;m sure iPad will give the more refined tablet experience, at least for a recreational user, but as you&#39;ve said in this video the use case for most users seems better suited to the Surface. I spent $1800 on one it will be here wednesday. I use an iPad Mini5 for hybrid use (work/pleasure) I work over the road a lot and 99% of the time instead of getting my work laptop out I just grab my iPad Mini to write a quote or check on a job or what ever. I justified my purchase because of this. I use my phone for a hotspot and having my iPad instantly connect when I pull it out of my bag is a huge plus. My windows laptop is a pain in the ass most of the time to get to connect to my phone for internet. 3600 is not a lot for an iPad and plus that&#39;s small amount In general Sarcastic? can you do a review on the tab s9 Ultra <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=332\">5:32</a> I love how, when discussing doing work on a device, literally all youtubers talk about video and photo editing, as if that is what we all work on. 😂 That’s because they’re making the video recapping their experiences and not ours so video and photo editing would be part of doing their work Imagine using one the finest brains in the field of engineering just to trim down the size of a product by a few mm 😑😑 A feature which no one gives a damn after a point. Basically millions of dollars spent so that people can save probably 3-4mm space in their backpack. Giving a M4 chipset in a machine which lacks the software capability to utilize it. <br>These things are what is exactly wrong with Apple and the cause of their doom. They are spending resources in places where it is not required. All this gimmick is what causes the price of an Apple product to rise which in itself makes it irrational for many people. video started in the afternoon and ended at night Even as a millionaire, I would never waste $3,600 on a tablet :/ Retakes took till night 😂 MKBHD was a lot more objective about this. The lack of MacOS on a device that casts more than $3000 is criminal. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=144\">2:24</a> device name? remarkable notepad I&#39;m curious how a VM would run on this. An M4 in this with a tiny bit slower load times for heavy work makes me thing that it&#39;s power is being limited, either due to a technical limitation or to maintain the device being cool. Do they want that? probably not, but the option is available to you. Watching this on my 2013 ipad 💪🏻 I don’t know what are your real motives behind this video, but iPad Pro is still faaaar to be a real mac replacement. Tried the switch myself lately and bumped into many issues… poor file management, mouse/trackpad right click options are poor, horrendous bezels on the Youtube videos that eat half the screen, etc etc. Had to rush back to my mac.<br>Truth is Apple will never make the ipad a mac replacement, cause they want you buy both. Sure lemme just scribble what i want my second mansion to look like lol rich people Man really made a vid to convince and justify himself into buying it 💀💀💀 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=68\">1:08</a> because you can’t do art on it a great video, but I really want to know what song is in the BG at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=760\">12:40</a> onwards. Apple pencil needs to make a version for iPhone to rival Samsung&#39;s S -Pen $3500? How soon do you have to replace it? Even 5 years is bad. You where my inspiration to make my youtube channel, thank you. the samsung intro was cooler Files works really well on an iPad, if you want to move files around within your device and to any other compatible device. The biggest real annoyance for me is the inability to move files to and from every other app on the device. Many apps are sandboxed. For instance, my third party alarm clock only plays clips from Music, and cannot even see anything from VLC. The other annoyance is the inability to just add media files to Music from other apps without having to connect to a Mac or other &#39;master&#39; computer, add the music to the computer&#39;s version of Music, and then &#39;sync&#39; the iPad to it. It&#39;s very inconvenient and clunky, whilst requiring you to have either another computer for the job, or to buy media from Apple&#39;s online store. Binge watching Mrwhosetheboss😂❤ Modern smartphone screens are too big. They don&#39;t fit into pockets easily, are difficult for someone with smaller hands to hold easily, and are often too large for some wireless chargers. If I want a good sized screen size in a lightweight device with a decent on-screen keyboard, and excellent battery life, I buy a tablet. Like the one I&#39;m using now. If I want complete portable computer functionality, I buy a laptop. My MBP battery also lasts all day. I have the iPad Pro from 2019. It still operates like it&#39;s brand new. I have no reason to upgrade. Great you can afford it the rest of us are surviving on a day to day basis. The priority is to have a roof over your head and to have food on the table. The rest such as apple us just bullshit Shilly review I need your review for tab s9 ultra 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 you can make an iPad if your phone sells well😀 Just ordered the new iPad Pro m4. I don’t need one as I already have an iPad 10th gen but WTH, why not lol Which is when you convert from Dollar$(3600) to Rupees₹(299, 016) which is I mean that is just an obscene amount to pay for a tablet. <br><br>While i pay ₹27,000 for a phone and thought it was ridiculous expensive.<br>Broke me(literally dying inside) Anyone who uses &quot;smart&quot; everything is not a bright cookie. Anyone else watching this on an iPad? Just buy last gen 😩 that toothbrush scene always irritates me 😂 Is this cool? Yeah. But most people buying this probably wouldn’t notice if it were switched out with an ipad air. Such a poor decision, but then again $3.6k is chump change for him. You have wasted your money. Please come back with a video comparing the base model to the spec that you have purchased. hey man hey man Mrwhosetheboss: Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.<br>Everyone: For Content farming 😅😅 what am I doing here, i dont even have an iphone. never used any ios device. iPad OS can’t do what Mac OS does. My CRM system has versions for both. I can only do document and e-mail merges on  Mac OS. There is nothing better than walking around your house with your iPhone on a MagSafe charger and using the larger screen and desktop-like robustness of an iPad. I know you’re saying the tablet is actually not a more robust experience (and maybe that’s true of Android tablets) but I suspect you’re just being unfair. Hey Mrwhosetheboss I&#39;m George from Namibia (in Africa) I wanted to ask if you would please send me an iphone so I start my own YouTube channel 🙏. Can i have your macbook? will this work with 10th gen? Its quite funny bc my fyp on tik tok is all abaut how the m4 ipad is better than the S9tab ultra lol poeapole dont understand that the ipda uses a laptop chip lol meanwhile the S9Tab ultra uses an mobile chip İ thought m4 you know the car bmw m4 competition We need to stop getting so wowed by thin electronics, it hurts durability and increases repair difficulty IPhone or ipad not like because more things are free on Android The funny thing is when there is so much comment about how it don’t make sense for people to spend so much for a machine to watch YouTube and Netflix, people are still willing to buy this machine at this amount of price. bro didnt want to loose the money on the ipad so he made a video of it and made alot more I know why! Because you will ship it to me for free! 😜 Me watching him say I don’t need a MacBook if I buy this iPad having just spent 1800 on an M3 MacBook Air with 16GB As a tablet user:<br>Digital art. Need I say more. Bor me wat why these npc&#39;s keep buying useless sh*t like tablets? I&#39;m watching this on a samsung😂😂😂 You are a salesman trying to convince people to buy an overpriced tablet, shame on you First question I had seeing the new camera array - how about &quot;spatial video&quot;? Wasn&#39;t that a &quot;Pro&quot; feature? Is this a way to foreshadow they are killing the Vision Pro, or are they doing single camera and lidar magic? wake me up when it will be able to run photoshop, illustrator and premier pro. I am watching Apple employees praising their products. Hahaha 😂😂😂😂 The top spec IPad is $2599 in the US. Even with the highest sales tax in the country at nearly 10% the Ipad will still be less than $2900. Not sure how the one sold in the UK is so much more expensive. Can you drop the video now please?! 👀 The only reason is because he has the money. Best $2100 I’ve ever spent. IS THIS A SPONSORED VIDEO BY APPLE? 😮 I would never spend that kind of money on a tablet with a shitty camera. The camera had better be the same as the iphone. Nobody is buying this for the camera Because you’re a tech YT channel and if you didn’t, your views would drop Weren’t tablets 500 bucks? 4.40 I am also so surprised, why does someone need an iPad if they need to use something without touching it? Get a Macbook then! 😅 Zenless zone zero??? damn you probbably should have got a surfice but onistly its yout decition <br>Video recomendation: conpare the ipad to a surfice I do understand the excitement about this tablet and it feels like it is one of those utopia gadgets but... It is not going to replace the laptop for me, since, gaming on pc is the only kind of game play (excluding the virtual games) I am good at. It is gonna be good when it becomes a norm for all of the tablets, than we are gonna see it being used by scientist on the field as well. I mean they are using them already, but can not use it for everything as of now. This is just an example though. Pure stupidity….Apple Fanboy that eats up anything Apple offers up. Because you can As long as the iPad has a good “writing”/matte screen protector it’s  pretty sweet to use the Apple Pencil with.<br> I like to use extra fine nibs as well. Just don’t skimp out on them, if you drop your pen they will break, stay in the 8-12 dollar price range and they tend to last longer. Please say US dollars, not dollars; There&#39;s a lot of different dollars and that makes you sound wrong in most countries a macbook air with a touch screen, no keyboard and ipad os What is bro yapping about sounds to me that you are just making excuses to buy a new unnecessary gadget. I mean I would spend that if I had a channel with this size 🤣🤣 3.7million views  as the time of commenting  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re okay. The real reason he spent $3600 is because he can . Isn’t this more powerful than my 2016 MacBook Pro 15 inch? I’m just worried about the battery for video editing lol. Can I stream games from this? I bet it runs Genshin really well. But again. Battery.. aspect ratio of screen bothers me the most. What should I buy an iPad Pro with the magic keyboard or a Mac Pro or a surface pro. What is better for students and better for your money Me with a iPad mini 4 💀 because you wanted and because you can Why? You are out of your mind? I get that the performance is great and everything but WHY JUST WHY would apple remove an ENTIRE CAMERA??? Like it makes no sense macbook should really be there for developers and those who benefit from accessing file system, command line, calculation power. also if you need SD-port or such. otherwise iPad is a decent alternative. I use it to study Spanish by reading Nat Geo Espanol. It&#39;s much more convenient that reading paper newspapers cause of integrated dictionary (+AI), markup possibilities and internet access. Because you have an Awesome tech channel and bags of cash? Will you please check out the deminsity 9400 , sounds like Darth Vader s hard on lol what&#39;s the game&#39;s name because why not? you have the money bro Dude decided to spent $3600 on a product that costs $999. that&#39;s ± R61 000.😦 that&#39;s a price of a second hand VW Citi Golf. Maybe the damn manufacturers should stop using glue. Can someone gift me the 2TB pro version with the pencil and keyboard please 👉🏻👈🏻 coco melon watchers gonna go crazy for this Is there a file manager on this iPad? Can you copy your files to a thumb drive if you want? Could be a good machine for digital artists, but knowing apple, it&#39;s probably a trash device restricted so much that it&#39;s unusable for anything other than watching youtube videos, the device is only for the rich people like you who want to flaunt the apple logo, but sadly that too is futile because Noone is impressed by an apple logo anymore.<br>A device like this could be the future for digital artists, if it would run a full desktop style operating system without restrictions, and it would be super powerful so as to do stuff like digital sculpting or 3d painting or vector design etc professionally, but the software on a mobile os would be restricted so much that it would be a very expensive toy. Also the pencil is perhaps not pressure sensitive either. This device seems awesome, just not easy on your budget. 💰 😳 yapping 100 I find apps on the iPad brain dead compared to apps on the Mac.  I do agree Netflix and entertainment apps are great on an iPad. Now you are actually a apple representative 😂 justifying $3600 price tag just as 60hz screen on iphone 15 That grey sweater looks cool 👍🏼 Idk how he got to 3600. I maxed everything out and only came to 3046. (Which is still absurd) I think it’s because he’s from britain This should have a Mac OS option for this with this hardware having a hybrid switch between Mac OS and iPad OS because iPad OS is crap for pro applications and pro work. wow that wall garden is really high for this guy. so glad i am on linux Bro, I could buy a f***ing car of that money What the hell is a smart toothbrush? this is something i wont be buying its not like you can afford it @@Xplays27363 are u sure? LOL i have m2 ipad pro, with the overpriced keyboard and pencil 2, just to watch youtube. are u sure i cant afford this m4 ipad pro? Nah my $15 pen from Amazon is good for me 😂 what is that game hes playing on the ipad i can&#39;t find nuthin bout it anywhere 😐 I love your videos ❤❤ You are now feeling exactly how i felt three years ago when I got the M1 pro and spent $2,300 USD hoping it would be a one stop replacement for all my devices. unfortunately i still have a desktop, laptop, WACOM, and the IPAD is sitting on a shelf doing nothing. Apple needs to unlock the capabilities of the IPAD to run desktop applications.  Holding it back so that consumers buy both a MacBook and a IPAD is frustrating. Tablets are have bigger screens and are much cheaper than phones. broo, your son is going to be pround of you 🤣🤣🤣 Pls can you buy me a quest 3 Android user here. Saw the add and came to see what&#39;s that about of pure curiosity. That price is absolutely crazy! Anyways, if you watch it back it does sound like a good ad for Apple and at the same time shows you why Apple isn&#39;t giving you a touch screen laptop! Honestly, your vid gives you all the reasons why rid off Apple. And in the end, you&#39;ll be connecting it to a bigger screen at home. Oh well, if you got the 💷 💷 then spend them. And next year Apple will come up with their best yet again and some will be checking if they have any body organs left to sell. Enjoy What about HDMI screen sharing When the tablet screen costs more than a used car FML 🤦\\u200d♂️ this era 3600? 😂 Lmao no one cares just say your broke less battery than previous generation will be a deal breaker for me. no one gonna talk abt what he was doing w the toothbrush at the start of the video...💀 I still can&#39;t see going from a 34&quot; monitor (or a 32&quot; and a 27&quot;) to a small screen like that. Most people aren&#39;t running around so much to work full time with this. Also, this is like all stolen from the Surface which is still a PC. Granted, the screen looks amazing and would be a fine second system to travel with but I couldn&#39;t see doing actual work on it. toothbrush was sus... aint gonna lie. needing extra storage when you have 2 tb goes crazy 😭 😭 me with my 64 gb Because you can? Everybody switch from ipad pro to samsung s9 ultra with so much more fonction over the Apple offer, with his massive 14 inch screen, we are far from phone experience, the only thing missing are the apple jailled final cut but everyting else are better on android. The s9 ultra 1tb for €1247 GBP with a better pencil expérience included. Why is no one talking about the godzilla in the background? Battery life and storage are 2 things I&#39;d never wanna compromise on😅😅 my apple pencil has been lost for over 2 years MI only one who noticed his new hair look:) No one is doing it I want to see this line up tested:<br><br>iPad m4 13 inch 9c binned chip<br>iPad m4 13 inch 10c full chip <br>iPad m4 11 inch 9c binned chip<br>iPad m4 11 inch 10c full chip<br><br>Battery life is very important to me the full chip seems overkill/overrated for the price required to get it. So I’m just curious if having 1 less performance core nets you any battery life gain. icloud subscription doesnt give you more disk space Honest answer: because you wanted to get views and a nice tax deductible You sure know how to use that toothbrush 🪥 I just built a PC with a 4070 to super and a 7800x3d CPU Asus gaming motherboard so on it was little over $2000 total for something that not even close in power to my PC cost more then if I would gotten a 4090 that&#39;s insane Must be nice spend $3600 on a iPad The First <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=90\">1:30</a> Minutes i was like: Finallyyyyy Someone who Gets me why i don’t Own an ipad Got to see these in person, thinking about replacing my 2020 macbook pro with this. This is a sponsored video 📹 ah yes<br><br>one of the most powerful apple product to watch netflix on Apple sucks. Dont recommend Actually the pencil from last years iPad Pro has a spot that does the same towards the tip Bigger question is how does one even spend 3600.00 on an ipad? All those things he said at the beginning about tablets being the same as a phone is the whole reason I looked for one that was different than a phone and that means it has to be running a full fat operating system. <br><br>For those that don&#39;t know a full fat operating system is something like Windows, Linux or Mac OS.<br><br>Yes I&#39;m beating around the bush. I bought a Surface tablet. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=756\">12:36</a> woooah, that&#39;s one way to say chillin&#39; with the homies... You&#39;re spot on, But oft times I need direct phone to phone call which iPad does not do. and Samsung Tabs do. What was that 3d app? It is a no for me, that much for for an Ipad, I would rather buy a high end gaming pc or gaming laptop😅 Can the you do hardcore programming on the iPad like one can do on a pc? Congrats on ur wedding Arun <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=520\">8:40</a> anyone who actually own a gaming pc or console WHEN ARE YOU MAKING AN IPHONE 😢😢😢 I usually like these videos but at the start saying that &quot;..they have a big redesign..&quot; is kind of a stretch. Sure they have a new chip and screen. But didn&#39;t most new generations of iPad improve over the previous? Yes it&#39;s way better but it&#39;s not like a complete redesigned Do you know what&#39;s better than a slim iPad? A waterproof iPad! How did they miss the mark on that? 😂 after i bought near 576$ in tab S8 i thought i&#39;m going to get laptop replacement to do working outside home, but now i use it only for tiktok, youtube, and playing other media stuff.. in fact in just less then a week ago i bought HP Pavilion Plus 14 for 790$ and my productivity going up as exactly as i wanted, it got enough battery, can still play AAA game, better in work stuff.. 🙁feel like those 576$ wasted Ha! I don’t have a computer, but I do have an iPhone 14 Pro Max. This phone is all I need for my online existence. Let&#39;s not kid anyone. You spent it because you can afford it. I hate laptops and only use tablets. The sound quality on the M4 is very very poor compared to the 2018 ipad pro. Regrettable purchase. I think tablets have become more popular in children as parents would limit the age of having a phone which, in my opinion, has become ridiculously young. I am not too sure why it is specifically tablets although I have seen many children under the age of 10 with full-on gaming pcs! I don’t see why children can’t just have a tablet to play games on instead of them needing a phone, a laptop and a gaming pc. Honestly I get that older children in their teens might be ready for another level of gaming with more advanced technology. Maybe if someone wanted to borrow a parent/guardians’s laptop if they wanted to do something they can’t do on a tablet. But some things kids have, they really do not need. If only it was thicker so it has more protection and battery,it would&#39;ve been perfect You can get mobile app on your macbook btw If you buy the based macbook air with 4gb of ram and with a keyboard for 999 but the ipad also cost 999 but yoy need to pay 400 dollars for a keyboard and another 120 dollars for the pen for that amont of money get your self a macbook with ram upgrades I got 2 ads of 20 sec of moto which is unskipable 💀💀💀 Arun hovering over the buy button and thinking he can get the money for it through a review video. So a free ipad technically. 😂 IPAD PRO M4 VS GALAXY TAB S9 ULTRA 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 Hey Mr who&#39;s the boss, can you do an EDC video Never seen as biased a video from this account before. I&#39;m not saying you got paid for this, I just think you gave a veryy personal review of how you just love this product, instead of giving the rather unbiased and sensible reviews you usually give for any product. Bro has literally bought everything in this world😂😂 bro plizz donate me your new iphone 15🙏 imm using old poco x2😭 your poor big fan are you in Vienna? Sold your soul bro, you don&#39;t deserve respect anymore May you please make a review of the Samsung Galaxy A55 5G Hi Bro How are you ?<br>I want to buy these electronic devices how it&#39;s possible ? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=519\">8:39</a> what is bro doing You spent $3500 on the iPad Pro M4 because you could earn over $100,000+ making a 16 minute video about it. Wanted to buy MacBook Air because other laptops feel cheap (no 2k+ tag price), later I came on idea like in this video to replace laptop with iPad, sounded good...but then I installed Adobe Acrobat Reader on my iPhone and immediately monthly plan was &quot;offered&quot; after 7 days trial, so I deleted the app, canceled my decision to buy iPad or MacBook because I don&#39;t want to pay for every fuc**ng thing on it to make it usable. Despite having USB-C on iPhone I wasn&#39;t able to transfer files to external storage from downloads, so I had to find a way to send files on Windows PC despite having iTunes, this lead me to decision that my next phone will be again android, but still I watched the video :) Until iPads run Node js and VS Code they can’t ever ‘replace’ a mac for me I&#39;ve been waiting for iPad full review video and coming to your channel every day to check if you&#39;ve uploaded or not. I wonder what&#39;s taking you so long or you are not interested in making a review video? this pro is just obliterating the whole point of the ipad air Still not as thin as the Vivo X5 max. I remember in one of his videos, he showed a website where we can see all the phone camera and the sensors, and if we click on those, we can go to all the phones which uses the same camera sensor. I just remember that the website logo was something blue in colour so if anyone can tell me the website name, I would be really grateful. ipad is not for games is not forever it has a time period where it is for games after that lag it is 😅😅😅 Tables are the best at media consumption <br>10 inch oled is all someone needs to watch yt or tv shows from the bed They copy the s24 ultra screen..sucks apple It&#39;s just a nerfed MacBook, Apple is trying to replicate Microsoft Surface with this new iPad, the power of PC and tablets all into one...and they are getting closer to cloning it. I mean, by 2030 iPads have to get the power of an MacBook. I brought it, i am constantly anxious about it bending. Carrying a 4000 dollar worth product in a backpack specially for a college student, who takes public transport, gets constantly get  banged into things, bumping into ppl (LIVING LIFE) skate boarding, re sold it brought Samsung A9 (I am so.happy) i sometimes use it as a frisbee (not kidding) i am so happy. No point in keeping the tab at home or be constantly worry (anxious) about when it being in backpack, even with cover on. Cant believe Arun and me are of same age but living completely different lives (i love my life). Being a YouTuber is exhausting, imagine being in a constant state of carrying this, or it getting stolen. You should keep it in a bank. Laptops are more durable, even macs for that matter. Good luck, i hope it works well for you. Can you gift a cheapest ipad air? I have a dream to illustrate there through procreate 🥹 Not a smart tooth brush?! lol Imagine spending 💲3600 on a tablet only to watch Netflix. Can💎 Honor magic 6 could be the new android king👑 🥶 This feels like a sponsored video. You are so beautiful 😘🇺🇸 But do you want to work on a 13” tablet I can see the XDR through the screen. Ever heard of UTM? If you don’t need your laptop send it my way I’ll give it a good home 😂 the backround looks soooooooo fake<br>not a hater shits too expensive these days &quot;I feel like i&#39;m not holding an Oversized phone&quot;<br>Take a look at the iPad Mini 6. Been using the galaxy tab s8 for about 2yrs now and absolutely love it. Had no need to buy a laptop as it does what i want it to do. Usec to love laptops. But those days are long gone. Havi g the same chipset tha5 my s23 ultra has isnt a downside. Our mobile chips are stupid powerful that smartphones dont really make the best use case. Th3 only fail point is gaming. Well that is if you want to play console like games. But other than that i never felt the need for a more powerful cpu.<br><br>My pc is where i will be productive enough that i actually need power. I have a 7950x3d, 3080 12gb, 32gb 6000 cl32 ram. And a bunch of storage. I dont need my tablet to do what my pc does. I just need my tablet to do what my phone does but better. Remote playing ps5, using youtube. Browsing web etc. And cause i own a s23 ultra and a tab s8 i can use wireless samsung dex. So i can have access to the internet and use my tablet. Is it a perfect experience? No but it is a usable one. And i dont pay anything extra.<br><br>But by and large the number 1 thing i do on my tablet is read. Novels, manga, light novels, web novels etc. The screen size is fantastic. My tablet allows me to do 80% of what i did with my laptop. Its smallernthan a laptop, thinner than a laptop. Better battery life than a laptop. Easier to travel around with over a laptop. And what it fails at doing my pc does and does it much better than any laptop or tablet could ever hope for it to do.<br><br>Hell cause i own my tablet i have never felt the need for a dual monitor. My 55&quot; 4k 120hz vrr qled is all i ever felt like i needed cause i can use my tablet to do s3cond screen function without being a second screen. Or i can even use it as a second screen for my pc. Except have it wireless. So i can lay down in my bed and use my wireless keyboard and mouse and just lay down and use it that way. <br><br>Tablets are fantastic. And heres the thing that $3600 tablet will perform very similarly in daily life that my $1000 tablet can do. The niche edge case of using the video editing on the go isnt worth 2000. And it wont perform as good as a computer. Its a waste of money. Because you&#39;re rich? Can you Bless me with iPhone please Dude I saw wish to know why don&#39;t you review huawei gadgets cuz you are a tech reviewing channel but you don&#39;t entertain huawei products anymore it&#39;s been a while since you last spoke about huawei.... Even with the section from the united state we still want to know about it I still use my old iPad GEN six for drawing I have a question, why does Samsung insist on making fun of Apple and then does the same thing?  For example, when Apple took the phone adapter out of the box, they mocked Apple like clowns, then they did it themselves, or Apple introduced a titanium phone.  Then Samsung came and copied Apple. Do a experia 1 mark 6 review and give your feedback please yeah your play head video isn&#39;t sponsored why put it? I could buy a Apple Vision Pro for almost that price &quot;mummy my skibidi toilet is bent&quot; The dude just spent the entire video trying hard to convince himself why he NEEDS the new iPad Pro over the M3 Max MacBook Pro 💀 Looks more like samsung tab s9 ultra Apple is just a brand not a useful product... Similar to Gucci or other famous brands and are just for showing off... Where&#39;s the ipad you spent 3.6k on? i bet someone would spend $3,600 for an ipad just to draw ok lets see how he show of today Bro please giveaway me ps4 only please🥺 Because you&#39;ve got money and you are making more from it with this video Apple fanboy WIth two displays the battery performance should actually increase if you&#39;re not having it at full blast. 2x at 50% is going to be way more efficient than 1x 100%. Same as with CPU&#39;s or GPUs. The last 10-20% will cost a huge price.<br><br>So if you&#39;re just using it &quot;normal&quot; i&#39;d even expect the battery life to be better and hence Apple decided to go for a thinner size and a lighter battery. Case 46 — Smart Money<br>Case 47 — Uncivil Rights<br>Case 48 — Blood in the Blender<br>Case 49 — Immortal Sin<br>Case 50 — Programmed to Kill @Mrwhosetheboss does have a point. From my experience doing app and web development I ended up having more customers who trusted/stayed with me if I directed them to contact me via common apps than when trying to redirect them to my website or email. As of right now, that extra sense of security that people get knowing something comes directly from the PlayStore (Google) and AppStore (Apple) makes doing business a lot easier. The iGlad pun almost made me unsubscribe You have a very large platform and yet you never mentioned Palestine. Why? Day 9 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. ❤❤❤😊 You gotta make one unboxing video for huawei pura 70 ultra😮 Why at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=442\">7:22</a> all the people is freezing?

With its desktop mode, you can accomplish a wider range of tasks on Android, including running desktop operating systems, games, and applications. Cool, 100.000,00 R$ gadget. Most useless product ever. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=385\">6:25</a> Is that fckin AutodeskMudbox running smoothly on IPad? One big use for iPads: music! The full-size iPad pros with a foot pedal to turn pages are legitimately the best way to store music at this point, basically no matter what. The only issue is that if they freeze during a performance you’re screwed, but they’re still really nice. Plus, paper has the exact same issue, just in different ways (missed or failed page turn, music falls off stand, for some reason your part’s in the wrong order, etc) I&#39;m sticking with my 256GB M1 Ipad pro. I don&#39;t need to upgrade since I mostly use my Ipad to watch TikTok for bigger picture than my phone. 😂 I have the 11” M2 cellular iPad Pro and it’s definitely a ‘freeing’ sort of device. You can pop it open ANYWHERE (on the bus, in the middle of a field), work on something with cellular, close it, and go. No wifi to worry about, and phone OSes are apps are built to be interrupted. The small size also makes it super easy to use on the go (I personally think 11” is the sweet spot), and my MacBook is now getting a lot less usage. I wish I had the new one, it would be so useful with that amazing calculator, man I’m doing Geometry over the summer right now, and get algebra 2 my next school year, that new IOS 18 ipad calculator would be so useeful Apple is a joke, they aren&#39;t what they use to be Great video Most powerful adult movie streamer 😂 Can you do one on Huawei&#39;s new phone Ps. <br>Mrwhosetheboss can you send me a game boy I&#39;m sorry this is a waste of money. No sane person should want to spend over $1000 on any tablet. If you have the money sure whatever but this pricepoint it&#39;s bizarre to even entertain the idea of such a device. you won&#39;t have your iPad organized like a PC then just use the PC launcher it has all the features of the PC so now you&#39;re organized too I can it&#39;s a macbook and an iPad at the same time. So instead of going to 2, you can get this one instead. And the M4 chip is a monster, not sure it runs big tasks yet. Probably gonna buy this after a couple years waiting for the price to go down. Sir please I can&#39;t afford a iPhone 11 pro and I&#39;m from Nigeria please can I get one free from you Free Palestine 🇵🇸 All they need to do is let it swap between Mac OS and iPad os and they will sell out Ipad&#39;s big buser are students and you didn&#39;t even mention onec. <br>Also, I felt it&#39;s a biased video. Just clicked to see people commenting how ridiculous that title is.<br>Worth it 😂, what a joker this guy is Apple want you to buy bad laptop with bad ipad if you try to be smart all this was already available on the old ipad pro .. no idea why you are switching now iPad kids just got a upgrade Id take my MBP any day. My tablet is an old Microsoft Surface 3 Pro I bought for 100$. It has i5, 256GB SSD and 8GB ram, 2k display and a decent keyboard. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> woah woah chill bro JUST AN ACTUAL LAPTOP FAM! THAT&#39;S A BRAND NEW GAMING LAPTOP MONEY RIGHT THERE You said you paid 3,600 but at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=816\">13:36</a> you say you want to keep a close eye on battery life &quot;while you are testing&quot; I know the answer: Cause Apple paid you 36,000$ for the advertisement, right? xD I think samsung payed more Capitalism at it&#39;s best. Convincing us to buy to look into screens even more. I like the touch of the uniball porn hitting my scribe book. I could really get this, but not when it costs that much 1 Your have they money Friend <br>2 Your make a video 🤨 i would be happy have this Tablett use all the nice apps inside (  exklusive) only the apple eco system Buy 3600 USD ipad for google docs and home automation, netflix and youtube.. yea.. right bro really bought an tablet worth more than a apple vision pro 💀 Arun is doing tricks on it Apple always say that is their best product so far Nice one Did he forget to mention that this is a sponsored video ? 😂😂😂😂 they need to make an ipad macbook 2-in-1 combo lol I spent 3800$ on my iPad Pro from 2022 with max stats aka best specs and software with 2tb and cellular capabilities so worth it!! Still use it to this day! That&#39;s a very clever video. Well done. Thank you! please review Sony Xperia 1 VI and make a camera comparison with Samsung S24 Ultra Reveiw @huawei matebook E 2022 Y know why its dumb bc the keyboard plus pen is actualy much heavier than a mac 😂 BRO, I replaced my laptop to galaxy s7 like years ago.😂 They offer you a F1, but install the system for bicycle. 😅 Question?<br>Did you start making your own phone?<br>Untill you reach apple sub. Not related to the video but WHY ISNT GOOGLE LENS DIRECTLY INCORPORATED INTO THE ANDROID CAMERA. WHAT A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. So the only way to not have an Apple notch now is to get an iPad. OK. May i ask<br>Where is the setting? Imagine making a 16 minutes videos without having the product &quot;Because computer OS is more open it would be easier to pirate there&quot;. <br><br>I mean not really. Everything is and will be in the internet globally and in most case faster than in any app. While I dont feel the need to download anymore the older I get since I can watch them whenever on streaming services, there is no doubt that torrenting is in a lot of cases better user experience. I get the file and can do whatever I want with it. Buy a movie from one of these companies? Cant store it wherever I want and keep a copy. Company goes under, all paid content gone. Licensing agreements change, they yank what you bought from you. And its not like these restrictions do anything about piracy, the files that give you free personal use will be in the internet anyways pretty much instantly. If I cant download a file from a movie/series that I bought for and store it wherever I want and watch it offline/burn to blu-ray then I didnt really buy it didnt I? look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=274\">4:34</a> on ths video, haha. I see 3 hands. Did you use midjourney to make this video? Love your videos, thank you for all the effort you put into them! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen so much dedication on YouTube before. Hope you&#39;re taking time to focus on yourself as well❤ wishing you all the best! it’s like to have a bugatti  and 80 km limit What if you drop it by accident on the floor, is it sturdy enough to not cause a void in your soul when that happens.. Useless just like the vr headset something you use once and forget you have it slap a keyboard on it and you have a Mac air lol 😂 Apple in the event &quot;this is our thinnest product ever&quot; haven&#39;t you heard about apple card 🤨 You should give me your MacBook pro Watching this on a 90 dollar android tablet Wich is insane for gaming and everything I use it for everything and it&#39;s more powerful than my laptop<br>Also btw they took away one of the cameras on the ipad, so dont waste 3000 on an ipad he didnt actually bought the ipad but gave a review just by looking at it once in the apple store 🤡🤡 What was the name of your photo editing app? Bs Spen by apple lol In dubai it costs 4,100+ AED Apple didn’t give you one for review? Waiting for Zack @JerryRigEverything to do his magic on this😂 So you can make a video of it and earn I feel that the most comfortable form factor to hold is an A4 sized clipboard. <br>I used one of these a lot when I was working as a Laboratory Technician in Maynooth University.<br><br>I would LOVE to see a tablet that is A4 size with eInk display and a stylus/pen. “Hello guys and welcome to bored smashing” I am really looking forward to seeing the new Studio. When you realise this one iPad is worth more than multiple items at your home combined. Why i spent 3600$ for a tablet ?<br><br>Because i am super rich idiots For the new iPad being a full Laptop replacement It would need to run MacOs at least for me. laptops come with pens.  touch screens etc..   Are you simply saying that you want to replace your pc with a tablet? oh so yes Simply because you can afford and you need to review it for money Just letting you know, for each storage option, the amount of ram increases and decreases. Could you please review the Redmi Turbo 3 Its been a while since you havent unboxed stuff what a insane waste of money. could have bought a desk a gaming pc a 2k high refresh screen. gaming pro mouse and keyboard. and even a gaming chair with gaming headphones and you still wouldnt have spent 3600$ Remember This is more expensive than the f*cking Vision Pro Like to see video  about sony xpira 1 vi OMG pls make a video of the reMarkable 2 plsssssssssssssssssssssssss I still dont understand why you spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4. We still are waiting for that gaint iPhone!! 3600$? I can buy the full Huawei ecosystem with that money 😂 Sorry Apple but no way. me with 256gb on macbook air happy still.. liekick roller skate shoes review please 🙏🙏 Different to other comments, I find only one area where iPad OS still absolutely sucks: File Management. In every conceivable way. Well, I do need lots of Windows programs for work, and some legacy programs that won&#39;t run on iPad OS – but do on Windows 11 for ARM on an M1 MacBook. So I have to wait for retirement to switch … looking forward to this moment! Do u play Valorant ? 🌚 How long you will take to beat apple Imagine buying a 3.6k ipad without calculator💀💀😭 Another expensive over hardware spec tablet and yet still has the same capability of a 2021 Ipad pro because of a deliberately nerfed locked OS. Normies eat it up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=601\">10:01</a> I definitely don&#39;t like when a product sends me to their app. First, not everything needs an app. App-less products do not depend on servers. 2. A website or a browser is very powerful tool, you can manage all sorts of things. An app takes space from your device and can collect all sorts of personal data and you have little to no chance to control it. 3. A Pad with a clipable keyboard is just a thin laptop or Ultrabook but with limited opportunities. how does this work with apple vision pro gaming on mac does suck A LOY I miss the old MRWTB videos, now its just clicked bait and flashy garbage. Field day for @JerryRigEverything How do tablets have bigger updates and changes then iPhones. Bro i just want the iPad Air Get duke 390 or Aprilia 450 Sure, on a laptop you can&#39;t download Netflix shows and movies from the app. Instead, all you need to do is run one terminal command and you have full download access to every show and movie ever made. One day soon, if not very soon, iPads will replace MacBooks. Unrelatable, spend $3600, to do the same thing you&#39;re doing today, but slightly lighter. iPad Pro<br>That should include:<br>- Mag Safe<br>- Weather Sealed<br>- 3 Camera Lenses <br>- Pencil 3 with Eraser feature <br>- M Pro/Ultra Chip<br>- Extended Battery Life<br>- Thicker Design Apple have completely lost the plot. Here in Oz, the top ipad is $4500. That is just absurd. If o bought this thing it would be for movies and YouTube nothing more i perfer doing it on my laptop more tho Imagine they would make this ipad in an imac size haha Chuck doesn&#39;t use iPads. iPads use Chuck to buy more $CHUCK to save more dogs with charity donations @CHUCK_on_Base I have that I mean....... 2 in 1 PCs like the Surface has been doing that for years but with an actual desktop OS but ok 🤷🏾\\u200d♂️ But still can&#39;t replace the laptop 💻 ✌🏻 so no need to compare it with laptop 😅 You are right, but isnt that a Software Thing? Bro I still have a iPad Pro M2 Can anyone put a link or something to the parallax view app? 😁👍 He cuts away every branch of mine that doesn&#39;t produce fruit.

Buying an iPad was the biggest mistake ever for me… we need such a software which we can switch between macOS iOS ipadOS, they could do a lot more things but they don&#39;t because some of the products can not be sold anymore damn you&#39;re rich af. so basically iPads are dumb when u have a MacBook. only uses are drawing, designing stuff. ( accuracy with pencil ) and lastly to visualise plans,  THATS ALL - ANY OTHER REASON IS STUPID. Day 8 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. Why are you making so much pro apple stuff. Never have an Apple be repaired? You where from all tech to now just apple stuff. I am out. Bro you have lot of money so it’s nothing for you 😊 Imagine paying 3600$ for a software-restricted and hardware-side definitely not 3600$-worth device. Why isnt it worth 3600$?<br><br>Because your 150$ Motorola can do the Same? I&#39;d rather get an Ipad Pro M3 and a Macbook..

What 😂😂😂 Absolute ripp off.. Could buy a top quality Gaming PC  for that kind of money.. what the hack thats nearly 1 million in pkr. no middle class person earns this kind of money in a year here. Because i like wasting money. ..I have the mp 126gb iPad Pro in space gray (2023) it’s 12.9inches Which phone do you recommend <br>1)one plus 12R<br>2)iphone 12<br>3)samsung s23 S23 I love how you always deliver so uniquely. Good work. Currently broke my laptop, can you assist me get one for my computer engineering degree Get a life The biggest problem with iPad OS is the horrible file management! It sucks you&#39;re about to buy it because you&#39;re a youtuber who needs content to make money and you have enough money from youtube to buy crap like this, there i answered your dumb question The only problem is the price. And, yes, it&#39;s my problem. Hmmmm, mine spec’d out for $4000, so what upgrades did you miss? wow cool &quot;why I spend $3600 on an ipad&quot;<br><br>Because you have too much money to waste Game name Was these shot on the apple vision pro? I wait for the Video „X amount of Time I replaced my Laptop with the iPad“ from @MrWhoIsTheBoss Got a ad about that note book of yours I make it short „tax write off“ @MrWhoIsTheBoss This man isx4 the most successful utube guy you will ever meet! Can you code .Net applications on that iPad? Is it just me or does anyone else want him to buy all the razer blade laptops Hate apple all you want. Their tech are engineering marvels Enjoyable video. One thing though, I genuinely prefer to use a company’s website than their apps. Time and again I discover that the app is a dumbed down version of their website, and I eventually have to ditch the app to use their website to get full functionality. One example is MailChimp. There are features that just aren’t available through the app and so I log into their website via the iPad’s browser. Most of the time, a website has functions that a company’s app simply does not. Let me correct you, I don&#39;t know where you get that price, here in USA the price is $1300  plus keyboard $350 and $125 the Pen total of  $1775.00 Not me watching this vid on a iPad mini 4 😂 Tough choice!<br><br>I am in the same boat not knowing which way to go.<br>iPad Pro or MacBook Pro- for me personally I want the storage space but can’t justify the top tier price off the iPad Pro just for that and then there is connectivity issues with SD Cards that I use plus how do I get the additional storage connected to my iPad Pro?<br><br>I can’t figure this out so someone please help me 🙏<br><br><br>What I do …<br>I love watching movies and just want to edit YouTube videos plus store all my audiobooks (about 1-2TB worth) and have everything in one place for easy access etc<br><br>I just can’t figure out what to get other then buy both a MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro and that’s not in my budget lol 😂 Quite honeslty I don&#39;t understand the review. Most of the advantages you mentioned have been around for previous generations as well. If you want a laptop, get one. No need to spend money on apple trash. 🗣️ Hey Arun, I know ur probably not going to see this, but I wanted to let you know I can tell when you use AI to help you write your scripts, especially at the end and it doesn’t sound good so pls go back to not using ai ‼️ Apple is trash. <br>There is absolutely no justification for paying this much on a tablet. <br>With 3600$:<br>I buy a new PC extremly good with high end GPU 2000$<br>I buy a mid range samsung tablet (S9 FE is a pretty good deal) + androind phone + accessories + headphones for ~ 1000$<br>I burn the rest rather than buying an apple product.<br><br>Of course, given I have this much in the first place You haven’t gotten to the dad jokes yet. As someone who works in app and web dev industry. I for one hate downloading apps for everything. Web is overall just better and will usually not hoard resources of your device as long as you have good hygiene whereas apps can get access to all sorts of weird local hardware level access and I don’t trust that with every rando app out there. I just spec&#39;d out an iPad here in the states and it&#39;s only $2599 fully spec&#39;d... you guys are getting ripped of in the UK lol Poor Europeans getting ripped off. The official Apple site says $999 My bad $2000 Thanks for insight, I had 2 year ago I buy Ipad pro 12inc. and you comments convince me that I need to get this also . Just ordered it. Thank you for the great work you do. Apple, just make a detachable laptop  🙄 I&#39;m kind of the same, I have an iPhone, an Apple Watch, and recently got the MacBook Air 13&quot; M2 (what I am using) I don&#39;t see a need for an iPad if I have a MacBook, if I were to buy any new Apple Product, it would be a new phone, since the 11 only has 64GB, and that&#39;s why this has 512GB The girls at my college do NOT use/need $3600 worth of ipad😭😭 Unfortunately, this new $3600 iPad does not survive the toddler bend test. I am confused. The new iPad Pro 13 inch is listed at $1299 in the US, not $3600??? RECENTLY YOU HAVE A BIG FOCUS ON APPLE PRODUCTS <br>🙃 One day it will be a Macbook. You pick. Gaming of a beast PC, or, silly little screen that made of metal My ipad prod 2018 have been very useful as a mobile gaming device and still overpowered in today&#39;s normal games. I checked the apple website it’s says it’s only $1000 id rather buy an M4 rifle for 2,599$ than an ipad for 3,500. Bend it ist like you are talking about the first time seeing an ipad with an keyboard… it dies the same things the los ones with keyboard did. nothing new. ist the same restricted OS with terrible file system (even call it like that), a keyboard that’s probably the worse software keyboard out there. <br><br>it’s quite good in some things but if you really want to work with it. let me tell you from years of letdowns by the software. you will not be able to. <br><br>iPad OS is the worst software implementation for a tablet out there right now. what makes it good are apps like procreate, not the software apple put on there themselves. and samsungs tablets got a huge leap in productivity with there real window management. <br><br>if apple doesn’t announce any change at WWDC, I probably sell my ipad which is then my last apple device. too long time they call it a laptop replacement but it’s not really that for someone who really works digitally. too many restrictions and tons of bugs. Android/Samsung/google or apple and in 4 months, that iPad will collect dust and be used once a week to watch a YouTube video the couch, like all the other iPads. I love having an android phone and an iPad cause iPhones don’t seem worth it at all, but I love the iPad. And still having an android gives me the best of both worlds. I litreally watching this on the ipad m4 pro Old Is gold ❤<br>But it&#39;s good reviews 😅 Hey I saw you in Nottingham city centre a few months ago, but didn’t have the time to say hi. Just wanted to let you know I loved the vids Look at the remixes on this video 💀 The biggest problem of the ipad is that it is still an IPAD. lol No matter how great the screen gets you will still do the same thing as an ipad air or the regular ipad 80% of the time. I have an Ipad air and Im glad I didn&#39;t buy the Ipad pro. For what I do with it basically does the job. The saddest thing is that Apple does know what their doing, if they put a touch screen on a mac its the end for the ipad. the most expensive you can make your iPad is 3077 use by the way Are you smoking grass 🤣 i know why...for the views ...views turn to $$$... I completely disagree with the main point in this video. The reason I don&#39;t like tablets is BECAUSE of the apps. Why do I need to have something permanently installed on my device for practically every single function and use case when I can just do it one time in my browser and they close it? This really is End Game Tablet &lt;3 Hello Arun. Luv your videos Is it a review or Justifying your $3600? Who pays that kind of money for a tablet? Because you have money and to review the product to gain views to earn more money than product. Just simple How much money you got from Tim Apple for this one? you spend $3600 because you can. is it worth the money? NOPE.. you just gotta tell all the apple fanboys that it is though.. useless Mate, you are a ipad person, as you are a tech guy. Lets not get confused. looks like apple had thrown a lot of cash on Mrwhosetheboss AVP 👽 <br>You 🙉 heard why / and they both lost &quot;human trafficking / ... cool cause&quot;Darrell stabs/ I&#39;m tracking .../ Well they are tracking down &quot;groups / in particular &quot;Oakland kids group / ..../ They had been ✌🏾&quot;sleeping / adults ✌🏾&quot;clothed as middle schoolers / <br>AVP 👽 <br>... well at least / i can show ,/ they like to steal my &quot;devices/ ...but , also , .../ They been deleted in lock 🔐 up ( the Ingram hard drive)/ / so not a big deal/ .../ I was thinking of hiding it first .../ Butr then.../ Well , we&quot; broke it.... totally/ / // he wants to talk , on site:/ about /...r Kyle / sweet / not bad ,/ The money 💰 / things like me take their bus 🚌/ ... and it&#39;s sometimes about my ... brain 🧠 and mind ,/ right / so at this point / .../ Nevermind / / hey 👋🏾 &quot;Ranger Norris / ... I&#39;ll ask for you ,/ still here / .../ No not s lot of police&quot;( that i know)/ ...honey 🍯 do&#39;s/ no it&#39;s not / / In general, I feel what is the point of making macbooks if ipads are gonna have keyboards and do almost everything a macbook can do. Now dont quote me on that, because im pretty sure there are still functions a macbook has that a ipad is absent on. But then again i can be wrong. Over all i feel ipads will take over MacBooks in terms of ipads having keyboards, pencils and a wireless mouse (and if possible a wired mouse), and to include also, the fact that the ipads and macbooks use almost or probably completely the same processor. Lastly to include, the prices are crazy, for a ipad that costs 3600 dollars, at that point its not worth it by the prices (probably), you might as well stick with the ipads that have the m2 chips which almost literally does the same thing that the m4 model ones do. 3grand for table is nuts....buy mackbook instead :D Bro please buy me a new Nintendo switch 🥺🥺😌 Ohh !! Pubg mobile..... I need a sponsor 🙌 Just buy the £999 iPad Pro to watch movies.. quad speaker not bad 😎 really.  I prefer watching my movies collection on an iPad Pro compared to my iPhone.. <br><br>Looking forward to the Oled screen ^__^= <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=448\">7:28</a> Bruh, android and ios/ipados are bantamweight operating systems.  The latest phone chips are years and years ahead of anything the operating systems are capable of.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=589\">9:49</a> That&#39;s because everyone and their mom intentionally gimps their websites for mobile operating systems because they can collect more of your data by using apps lmfao.  Pushing everyone toward apps instead of websites is for the data broker industry, not the end user.<br><br>Like, obviously YMMV if tablets work for you but let&#39;s not get it twisted, your enshitification video applies to the whole mobile app ecosystem, not just the platforms you specifically mentioned. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ They made the iPad better than the MacBook, so you can replace it with the iPad, and the next MacBook will be so much better than this iPad, that you&#39;ll want to switch back to MacBook! And so on! Sustainability is key right? Three grand though, really? 🤔 In the laptop segment they had a competition so they extended the battery life, while in tablet segment they are way ahead of the competitors so they didn&#39;t bump the battery!! If m4 uses half the power unlike M2 then why not to leave the battery what was there already?! And that&#39;s the Apple thing!! Making Pro lighter than Air series is totally contradicting the initial concept of bringing &quot;air&quot; in the market! It seems that apple is doing something to cover up or has a massive new plans to get new ppl on the PRO!! And I contributed to that £2 877 iPad price, with 6 ads for a mere 16 minutes video.🚮 “Because any video I make about it will more than pay for the $3,000 iPad.” Slide over and tiling doesn&#39;t work that effectively on iOS. Consequently, you are better off with two screens, whether it be having two iPad Pros or an iPad Pro and an iMac. It makes sense for both to have stands and Magic Keyboards and Mice and at least one to have an Apple Pencil. The extra screen real estate and full screen multitasking beats the performance win of these new tablets. If you want to edit a movie you need a 5K iMac at the very least, if not a Mac Pro. From the looks of things reMarkable works well out of the house away from your desktop due to its long battery life and clear focused UX. Also, try to unplug some of the time whilst you are out and look at some trees! Why? Because your a multi millioner dude 13 inch?! i like you shirt. What is that? Because MrWhoseTheBoss is an Apple super fan (or being rewarded by Apple) and thus there will never be a price point which he would say things are getting ridiculous? Can I get a wedding invite? everything is excellent but one thing is missing i.e AI features. todays era technology is all about AI. apple must TAKE concern on AI. $3600 for a tablet? Bro, let&#39;s get back to reality! People in 2023: 3500$ for a headset?<br>Apple: Oh amateur, you haven’t seen anything yet what&#39;s the game at @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=775\">12:55</a> ? Can fold like paper 💀 I will buy it With YouTube money 💰 Everything sounds so gimmicky. It doesnt feel like any innovation. Doesnt excite the tech freaks. Ipad on a weight loss diet is not what power users want🤣. So much power, m4 chip, for an enlarged iphone is stupidity. Also, the point of buying an ipad dies where the price point reaches. A person being able to pay nearly 4000 dollars for an ipad (with the accessories) would not use the ipad’s power and rather have an macbook/windows or even better, an employee at his studio for the work. And that pencil innovation, stupidest ever. Literally, they can get better ideas from surveys rather than their research team. An eraser on the behind sensor, scrolling using pencil, camera shutter on touch of apple pencil, multiple kind of pencil tips. Thats what would be innovation. innovation which would be worth for an upgrade. none of that. major upgrade is in the price. People with crazy money are only the customers they gonna have. any rationale person would not upgrade to this from 2018 or later model because this is crap and very minor upgrade. lighter weight doesnt matter. thinner ipad doesnt matter, nor does those display numbers. A simple question - what value this ipad provides over the last generation? &quot;Let me tell you about this great new ipad that I am not going to use&quot;. Make sure to do a video how &quot;it&#39;s great but not quite there&quot; in half a year. That&#39;s mandatory part 2. Yep buy a powerful PC and a decent wifi 6 router and stream you desktop to you cheap couple hundred dollars tablet. All of that power, yet i still cant make a B4 1200 ppi illustration in procreate, disappointing I&#39;ve lost so much respect for this channel after this. Can You buy one for me ? ❤❤ I will shortly hand in my<br>Work MacBook and have no PC at home. For me an iPad with keyboard and pencil is the logical choice for a single device. As much as I love the Samsung ecosystem apple do know how to make a tablet and they do better than Samsung because of the M chip Samsung should have a separate chip for the tablets I&#39;m quite happy with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra. Where is that sweatshirt from? Day 7 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. As someone that works in the cinema industry, iPads are actually godly useful for me Full-on computer... LOL :D With an OS like this? It&#39;s a joke, not a computer. I just bought my m2 iPad Pro…. I though you already use iPhone and why do you need 8 tb. I only have 512 gb The one thing that I really don&#39;t like with apps is it being in this ward off garden that Apple control. Like the openness of the web that anyone can create a website and it doesn&#39;t have to be approved by anyone. When it works it&#39;s great but when Apple want to not allow a particular app on The platform then it is blocked. With a light laptop vs a tablet I think you get a better experience with only a little bit added weight. $4000 for a tablet is insane. Aren&#39;t you the guy from sensodyne ad? So many ads 😞 Sooooo basically you spent the last 16 minutes convincing yourself that your really need it. &quot;Because I didn&#39;t work a day in my life to earn money&quot; Well, I think these are brilliant and very informative comments.\\xa0<br>The answers to my questions I was going to ask Apple today have now been answered.  I have a 13inch MacBook Pro (with the Touch Bar), an iPad Pro 10.5inch and a Remarkable 2 (for just taking notes)  which I have not really used, and was going to buy the Mac mini so I could connect this up to my TV so I could use the Mac mini on tv like an iMac computer.  <br>But am now thinking sell all these and buy the M4 13inch iPad and the keyboard and pencil with it.  Then connect this up to my tv and get it to work as an iMac computer when I need it like that.  I think the best of all worlds, what do you think?<br>I am in my 70&#39;s, used to teach computers and now starting a small business selling greeting cards, wall art, book marks etc for digital and physical selling.  So I use a lot of clipart and photos, quotes and sayings and also use for writing little stories and having documents saved etc.<br>Would this work do you think???  🤔 Because you’re a millionaire? Good infomercial mate! I’ll stick to my laptop. His Apple bias is showing.😂 Nice add. Unsubscribe. Looks like the iPad is going to compete the laptop market too <br>For the multiuser specific experience (use it as a laptop or as an iPad device) Since you have money but don&#39;t know where to spend it. I just found out after years of not using the iPad Files that the file handling nowadays is actually pretty good and robust on iOS. I can get shit done as quickly and easily as on mac, it just took like 15 seconds of adjusting ❤🇮🇶Hello, suggest me the best channels for reviewing phones. Thank you. I am from Iraq Well said, I nees to see Those who want Arun&#39;s &quot;what&#39;s in my phone&quot; video. 🙄 He spent 3600 on the iPad because it&#39;s going to make him 10x that with this vid😂 If you know how to use it and utilise the power. And you can afford it. Best if you can buy it via your business and make money from it.<br><br>I spent that much on an e-bike and that is worth it for me. I’ve reached the point I am just saying fuck it apple. Keep it as an iPhone file management since you refuse to make it more mac like, but at least update the files app. It’s atrocious at this point. <br><br>This is coming from a brand loyal Apple customer Was great to briefly see you… 😅 but yeah… the points you made at 15 minutes, as someone that’s always been excited about an iPad eventually replacing my Mac, I don’t think this iPad Pro will simply because there’s no ‘pro’ currently in iPadOS unfortunately. Dunno solid hardware but it’s still just an iPad. As a software developer and a structural engineer this iPads serves little to no purpose for me lol Netflix and chill 😎 W8, are you saying that besides the sales number in notebooks are downing now Apple created a competitor for their own bad seller new amazing notebook ? Sorry, but that for me is sh*t... same tablets  every year, same phones, old innovations 💡 why apple still alive... M1 iPad Pro user here. I had the same thought processes as you when iPad came out. Hell i even got cellular on my and spect it out to Mac level price but man was I wrong. You will start using it as a “dummer” laptop but man sometimes you will go back to your Mac and ask your self why the fuck was i using my iPad? Lol Downloading video feature, Cellular connection lol,<br>Etc etc silly features he mentioned just to justify 3600$ on a device which will be mostly used for content watching 😂😂<br><br>For apple fans - True Value for money go get it.😅 I am surprised that the new Apple Pencil Pro and the keyboard are not priced at $169, $369 and $429, given that they have a lot of improvements. Wait, you guys across the atlantic can get small cars for $3600? I think your quest from moving from this MacBook that makes me drool to an ... iPad which however sophisticated is just an iPad. My life evolves around my MacBook. I have an iPad Mini 5 that I bought for $ 250 because I wanted to use an Apple Pencil for annotating stuff: further a toy on the side to read e-books and watch downloaded movies. Maybe we are moving to a world in which everybody only has an iPad mini with a M10 processor that one connects to a 30&quot; screen when entering the house. Yikes.... A$4,518.00 for ipad pro 13inch, 2tb, pencil pro, keyboard. 🤯🔥 For this price it needs to replace my laptop/desktop... The iPad mini 4 is also just 5.3 mm Me watching this video on a iPad Pro My wife only uses her iPad so the upgrade makes sense for her Day 5 and 6 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. How did you make this video without addressing the elephant in the room - that iPadOS is a mediocre desktop OS at best. Have you used one with a keyboard/trackpad and monitor? It doesn’t feel like a Mac, it feels like a device that is fighting you at every turn. I can already say you will use it for 2-3 days max hahahaha that’s it Overpowered device lacking a OS worthy of it. <br><br>Apple loves you spent all that money for no real reason. iPad the way it handles files is just ridiculous you just can’t work like this no matter what, saving files and then opening them again it’s a disaster, sometimes I try to make something in some apps then wanted to make some special things on the iPad but forget it it just doesn’t work You very excited almost sounds like me 2 years ago, took me 1-2 days to feel that iPad is useless, if I work Mac thousand times faster to make anything and test much faster on my iPhone. Bro review the ear buds that come with the Mercedes AMG one hyper car Is it me or am i only one that thinks he as a nice voice sorry. Not sorry love the video man keep up the good work Man, these guys are just full of air. Review my foot. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=170\">2:50</a> definitely. Especially if people put it in bags. Definitely for sure gonna have to buy a case for it. Interestingly the new iPad Pro is like a dinner plate. with the weight the, size and the thickness. inb4 he uses the ipad for a week and never uses it again it 2,700 us worthless, apple failed with this IPAD apple will kill the whole macbook line if they are willing to ship mac os with ipad(maybe also keep ipad os somewhere), but apple will be apple again if they actually do this Thanks for your review. I’m in whenever I hear the Queen’s accent done better. 😅 congrats on the upcoming wedding, too! 👍🏾 <br><br>🤔 there’s a question out there, though— the keyboard and trackpad are aligned to laptop memory muscle… even with Google Drive? I have last years iPad Pro w Apple keyboard/trackpad. I can do most things, but when I’m on Google Drive and I have to select / drag drop files like I do with my  Mac M2 trackpad. It just doesn’t work as well. I wonder about this 🤔 <br><br>Again, thanks for being objective and especially talking about price per performance. Good start at helping make a decision. <br><br>Finally, regarding iOS apps keep in mind most apps have constrained / reduced functionality. Agree about offline for video. Offline works fine sans video on a laptop. Hoping that someone will give me old device that they didn&#39;t use🥺 &quot;Why i spent $3600 on an ipad pro m4&quot;<br><br>Because it wasnt your money. Video: Ipai Pro M4<br>Me: Starts day, ends night DO a video on your custome game boy please More distracted by &quot;when I walk down the aisle&quot; but he&#39;s wearing a ring and a video invite to a wedding when she&#39;s already in a dress 😂 For your future smart home you should use home assistant to control everything. Do some research and please make a video showing how it works and what you think of it. ReMarkable 300$ New Ipad 3600$ LOL They want you to buy both, but I swear they would make so much more money if we could boot MacOS on these. He’s really giving it to that smart brush… What I got out of this episode… You gotta put a ring on it! It&#39;s amazing how much Apple plays with people&#39;s minds, how much their marketing company does their job very well. When a new product comes out from Apple, you start to think that you are already a flawed person because your iPad or phone is already outdated, and you need to urgently run to the store and buy a new one.🤦\\u200d♂ Nokia users 💀 <br>: just jokes I don’t use my laptop at all I use it for a math class which they say I need in order to use it. It’s for this program that makes you take an exam and unfortunately you need a laptop to use it. I would turn in my laptop and iPad just to get this honestly I just hope that it will be strong enough to use it for that purpose that way I can do everything on it!!! 😢 Does it come with a 3300 dollar PC because then I could see it with that. Please make a video reviewing framework laptops Funny how Apple pulled you into their walled garden starting with their watch. How much money bro have😭☠️💀 Ive always wished for a tablet before iPad came out.  I use my tablet more than my MacBook Pro.  Also why do you need 8TB?  Use a SanDisk or something.  But it seems you like everything in the device with zero fuss. Why not make a lighter laptop instead nah i prefer getting a tab or a whole pc rig. Both are way cheaper It’s my birthday today<br>Oh that I had 1k followers and likes on this comment <br>Means a lot guys ❤️😔 Why you spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4?? Because you can. You make good money. ** wink ** Are you going to be making a video about your wedding? If not, thats obviously fine, but if you do I would love to watch. Hey bro, love your vids, do you think the Honor 90 is a good phone for the price? Considered getting it but i dont know. you were sucking that toothbrush not using it!! (min: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a>) Apple seems to LOVE that $3,500 price tag. 3600 for watching Youtube &amp; Netflix. calculator ? No buying - until Apple give us the macOS on iPads to justify their claim its a MAC/PC replacement. If only they would combine the MacBook &amp; iPad then it would be the perfect device 😩 you do know im watching this on my ipad big reason why i have my samsung tabs9 ultra.  app versions are deff better then pc counterpart . specialy for my basic use like youtube, email, even word docs, and note taking. jus  better on my tab over my laptop. great video as always I don’t feel like I need to update form M1 Pro Do i need OLED? As your first iPad, yes it is great, but if I am looking to upgrade from M1 or M2, then no, there is not enough to warrant the change… You’re not a terribly bright guy… For $400 more you could’ve bought the M2 ultra computer… Which is 1000 times better than any iPad. You bought it because you wanted it; and, because you depend on such purchases to boost your channel and have 18.6M Subscribers making you rich. Not that complicated. If you spent 3600 on an iPad you need to have your head checked. and I say it again, $3600 for me to watch YouTube while I&#39;m taking a sh*t I give no respect for this thing, I had the First ever iPad back when I was 9 used it for years but when I grew I felt I need something REAL, so I bought a Mac than can actually complete real task! I&#39;m also sure I could get most use out of my ole Mid 2012 15 inch MacBook Pro than this overprice Gadget! cool to have but not with it I would use that money towards something els, and even maxing out a MacBook Air which you would say is stupid, is yet still more worth it! wow. The Most powerful Youtube kids machine is even more expensive than Apple Vision Pro (+100 USD) it’s still an ipad.. I think we are been scammed by Apple and Samsung. You buy a high spec devices to be told the following year it’s not the high spec that the new released device is the newest and best. We’re getting played. Samsung&#39;s tab chips are effortlessly amazing. Nobody can fault em. No matter the task U have at hand 👌🏾 it will get done ✅ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> 😶 most of the comments are about money, must be sad to be poor, DINK I think Apple should also consider small phones so we can use with one hand. Now a days phones doesn’t fit in my pant pocket. And why you should not. I like this style of video, very calm and informative. Apple has iPhone Pro, but MrWhoseTheBoss is Pro Apple.<br><br>He will say it is worth it regardless how much Apple products are priced at. \\u200b@@AdamMada-uc5duApple fanboy alert!!! Mrwhosetheboss fucked up. Lol. \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b@@AdamMada-uc5duAt least if I 😮wanted to know which iPad to get I can count on him since he is always pro apple. Now for non-apple products and real non bias review well I am shit out of luck and is heard to find any youtuber out there who&#39;s not bias sadly. 😢 What if apple makes a touch screen macbook pro  with a new software that does both mobile and Mac and manages to make a thinner hardware. I am an M1 iPad Pro user, I have the 1Tb model, and I love it, I don’t use anything else but my phone and iPad usually. Occasionally I’ll plug into a PC at home but it’s mostly for film photo editing, I haven’t quite found something on the iPad as good as negative lab pro in Lightroom You&#39;re losing a sub if you don&#39;t pin this comment. Nobody needs this Until it can dual-boot (or virtualize) MacOS, no more of my &quot;pad money&quot; for Apple. Do you have an older iPad Air like 4 or something to donate me please? Thank you! Because you&#39;re wealthy and a YouTuber and you need the best technology to create content. Enough said. Yes these ipads seems pretty good, most powerful than 80% of the Pc&#39;s sold in the market and all , but even if i am an Apple fan , i&#39;m strarting to think that Apple needs to Change Ipad OS totally, Why not let us dual boot with Mac OS sonoma ?? why can&#39;t i play Motorstorm Pacific Rift ( A PS3 emulated game who is running perfectly fine on my M3 Macbook ) .. Apple needs to open their OS and let people do what they want . This will drasticaly boost their sales i&#39;m sure of that. to make that video I am stil waiting for the Ipad OS keynote to know if i should  buy or not Dude, if you&#39;re sending stuff to your phone because you can&#39;t do it on your computer, you&#39;re using the wrong platform.  Also, what about heat dissipation, when doing serious crunching and other tasks on the move? Most immature video ever . <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=610\">10:10</a> acually apps have waaaay more rights on your device than web-version. That means app can steal your data/spy on you etc... and they actually doing it. Web version of an application can not do it since it limited by web browser permission (it can not turn on your camera if browser do not have that permission or need approvement from you). Nowdays one of main ways to earn money and improve your business is information (private information as you understand - where you walking/eating/how much  you ready to pay for services and thousands of other cases). So almost all service providers going from web-versions to app versions due to reasons mentioned in 1st/2nd sentences. <br>   To be completely honest, that not the only reason. Security of service, control over service options - all these things are much easier to realize in your app than in other gentelman&#39;s web browser. But personally for me its unacceptable being a &quot;product&quot; and i&#39;m trying to separate my life from being used to fulfil someone&#39;s statistics (especially when we see that companies taking this information do not pay you for it and do not have limits how deep they getting into your private life - which is clear stealing for me). <br>   I&#39;ve seen many adepts of &quot;i have nothing to hide&quot; propaganda and... thats i lie or clear luck of knowledge. Would you be glad to see how fast food sales grows copying your emotions from first kiss or your child born moment? And thats just small harmless example. How about pressing you to pay more and more for services (subscriptions as example) exploiting your personal weaknesses to certain colours/sounds/combinations of pictures? Still &quot;have nothing to hide&quot;? And thats not a &quot;future technologies&quot; for many years already. Someone can call it paranoic - yes it is, no it was paranoic 20 years ago... maby... Not now. I personally never saw the importance of an tablet… I’m a tech IT engineer but tablets?? Not useful at all!!<br>Laptop + Phone and it’s done 💯 Ngl this video specifically very satisfying and calming. Dunno if it was the music or the time moving along with the video Make a comparison between M4 iPad Pro and Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra or the S10 Ultra (when it&#39;s released) MY MOM BOUGHT THAT 💀 10 years ago i replaced my Desktop PC with a surface Pro 3 with the surface Dock. I studied film and made all the edits on that. Also I made Illustrations in Photoshop and animated them in After effects. all on that thing. now i own a surface book 2 and it replaced my xbox, ipad, macbook, and desktop pc. its the perfect hardware for creatives because your not limited like with an ipad.<br>The funniest thing is that every samsung phone has an better desktop and multi monitor support than those stupid ipads.<br>Never understood why anybody would limit themself with an ipad. Bro Mrwhostheboss pls review the honor magic 6 pro dont lie to your self you will never be able to do the work you do on a Mac on an Ipad. Youll always need a full blown computer. Apple will never allow Ipads to undermine ther Macbooks. even the advertisment said it was edited on Mac (and iPads) because on their own their useless This needs a “don’t try this at home” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=14\">0:14</a> i loved how they bragged thatthw new NPU is 60x faster than ther first Bionik chip Did anyone else notice that where Arun was the time of day changed from day to night throughout the video😅 Ap to pehla hi 2050 mai jee re..😂😂😂😂 You should be ashamed for spending this amount of money for a tablet Watching In m1 Bro is living the life 99% of viewers only see it in Utopic movies! 😂😂😂😂 <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/face-turquoise-speaker-shape\"></a><a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/face-turquoise-speaker-shape\"></a>new generösen from every pipal you now .

I&#39;m on a M1 version, and won&#39;t upgrade until the thing breaks as it serves no additional function. I am thinking of choosing ipad pro or ipad air for stock screening and daily note taking. Not owning an iPad and laptop before, so want to own an iPad like a laptop, which one should I choose?<br>120Hz seems make no difference The IPad Pro best competition is a surface pro, which at around the same price can do more than an IPad. Ipad OS could have a high tier with more use cases better than the standard one, like for digital creators and dev applications. <br>The surface Pro can do those things, and so IPads are only a choice for people in the Apple Garden Wall. You can already press the older pencil…. The problem I have with the iPad, keyboard case and Pencil is it’s trying to be a laptop computer when it’s not a laptop computer. <br>Why is it not a laptop computer I hear you say, well, it’s because of iOS. <br>That’s the iPads achilles heal… it’s not that it doesn’t have the power, far from it, it’s just not got the software to use that power with.<br>Yes, I’m pretty much sure I will trade in my M1 iPad Pro and buy the base model but I won’t be getting the keyboard case… it’s just too expensive!<br>A MacBook Air would be a better option than the pencil, keyboard case and iPad Pro in all honesty.🏴\\U000e0067\\U000e0062\\U000e0073\\U000e0063\\U000e0074\\U000e007f<br>Oh, writing on the iPad is not the same as writing on the Remarkable 2… Can u gift me one?

IPAD suck, especially the trash os Not a single mention of the iPad Mini in the new Apple iPad lineup. The 11&quot; Air is not a replacement for the much more usable Mini form factor. If they&#39;re killing the Mini line of iPads, I&#39;m done with Apple for good. They&#39;ve watered down their ecosystem of phones and tablets, and are consistently going in the <i>wrong</i> direction with product features. Ive already switched to  ipad pro from my pcs The real reason he spent $3600 on the ipad is because he wanted to make this video 100% lol He’s already made over 10k from ads from this video Facts Begging for clicks.

He started young, at a time of a young YouTube. And he had the advantage of starting a channel of very few at the time. He&#39;s grown big. Congrats to him. If you could do the same, as far making money, you probably would too. It&#39;s his job. And he&#39;s fortunate to have started his channel when he did, because it&#39;s very hard for new tech channels to come to an uprise, since there are now to many known super channels. @@smallego8068if that was the case, then he wouldn’t have released a video right after this one where he spends half the video talking about the problems he’s had using the iPad Pro, all the improvements and why he’s not making it his primary device. If he really was just a “billboard” for Apple, that video would almost be a career suicide. \\u200b@@pratyakshgupta8451 You are way too naive for this world if you really mean what you said.<br>In the video you mentioned he talked about how great the Ipad Pro is for the first minutes. He also smartly used those minutes to promote SIM cards as well.\\r<br>When he finally started with the criticism, he used the criticism to actually promote a totally different product, a Logitech mouse. But a few seconds later, one just realizes that the criticism wasn&#39;t a real criticism at all. Because which Apple user cares about Logitech products working with the Ipad pro? Right, no one. And then he immediately turned the attention to a Apple product that works perfectly fine, the Magic mouse. The criticism was actually a promotion for a Apple product.<br>The remaining &quot;criticism&quot; is a joke. Just minor things. He himself called them minor issues. Those will nobody keep from buying the Ipad Pro because the Ipad Pro has no competition. This is by the way a very typical behaviour with these &quot;reviewers&quot; when they &quot;criticize&quot; something. The will always put their ciriticism into perspective and weaken them by saying things like. I can life with that etc. Or as he said a few seconds later. &quot;Will I return it? No! I still love it&quot;<br>In the end Apple doesn&#39;t care. Apple probably does even appreciate the feedback.<br>And in the end, another promotion.

I have watched his vids since he first started doing this and I think the total opposite of what you do. @@MartinMurray1966 I don&#39;t think any Youtuber is paid directly by a big company.

Its a 73$ phone with a dimensity 6080 I am happy using a Chromebook with 8GB of ram that will updated into the 2030&#39;s for a tenth of the amount of this apple thingy...

With money saved I can buy a proper camera like a Pentax K1... meanwhile me getting roasted without getting roasted with my ipad 8: Why don’t you giveaway…I suppose that was totally unnecessary now Defnitely not fo iPad kiddo&#39;s Apple stole ad from LG and ban all users that said it. What a dishonest shit company. Nice product, boring, and hackneyed presentation😢 I paid less for my car, over $1,200 less I, too, was very excited to get my M2 12.9&quot; iPad Pro. A year and a half later, I still use my laptop for everything, and use the $1200 ipad for watching netflix on the sofa. It&#39;s such a great device, but useless for me when I can just use my computer, or a phone. the problem I have is laptop screens arent as good as this ipad is suppose to be they dont make laptops with good displays or they cost more than 2000 Soooo true exactly same here, I’m designer bough iPad on release of m1 though would be a great addition to my work making things on computer then going to iPad to draw somethings over it but men, it always turns into disaster saving files and working then it just doesn’t work, so many times I try it and always lost so much time for nothing now it’s just a website responsive tester for me, and sometimes watch some YouTube, everything else on my Mac and iPhone thousand times faster, iPad is just a fifth wheel in the work process I spend 1500 euros on that still feel ashamed about it, I only can imagine using it if they base iPad os on Mac OS it’s the only way, so we have a real desktop space and can have many windows one over another and can adjust them like we want and save  files everywhere like on a mac then yess it will be very great decide if not it’s just a gimmick. You cannot be a power user and do that. I swapped to an IPad Pro when my laptop died and it’s working, but I’m mostly writing with the occasional spreadsheet. For my uses, it’s overpowered. Even then, the laptop it replaced a $500 craptop from Best Buy, and I spent $1200 replacing it with this thing and the Magic Keyboard, so still not good bang for the buck considering I could get a MacBook Air for less. \\u200b@@epbrown01Can you gift me a cheapest ipad air?

Rather than own a separate tablet and a MacBook Air, I wanted a single device for content consumption and light computing. I went with an iPad after measuring my usage and finding I lean much more to consumption than creation, well over half the time.

The list is endless and I don’t believe any serious power user can. Some things: Excel doesn’t work with formulas, there is no preview function for a file like on a mac, you need to open everything to see what’s in it, the internet browser is a mobile version which means websites don’t work the same and extensions are not there like on the desktop browser.

Awesome vid as always❤ To me,it just seems  worse than my £700 laptop lol S10 ULTRA GOING NEG &gt;&gt;&gt; Why don&#39;t you do a head to head of the new iPad Pro and the Samsung S9 Ultra. You might not need to give up your Samsung Phone. Having said that, we all know you are an Apple fanboy. You said a bunch of nothing…. This guy saying i spent  3600$  while showing Apple store ipad video With MacOs I&#39;d may consider one Only good for those who are earning $3600 from youtube So you had to buy a keyboard/case you make it useful? OLED is a downgrade. I&#39;ll buy one when they get rid of it. MiniLED is superior. Hey Arun, you should get your 2022 outro back on videos cause it was so nice a music Hello arun... I love you content very much. <br><br>I want to ask you for a favour though... pls dash me your old cameras or any other of your old Samsung phones with good camera.. do that I can use it to shoot more videos for my channel... I have almost 20k subscribers but my content lacks quality because my phones camera has bad quality. <br><br>I&#39;m going to get monetized soon, and I swear I&#39;ll pay you back with interest.. please 🙏 Going from M1 to M4. Can u review Tecno Pova 6 Pro What a fool Ohh I know what&#39;s gonna happen in a few days someone will fold the 13 inch iPad. Iykyk. <br>&quot;iPad the size of paper, folds like a piece of paper&quot; Finally an Oled display The 13 inch is skinnier than the 11 inch because the 13 inch has more room to stretch out cpus and batterys Bro it’s 3 am and I’m watching this on a iPad 😂 hey I was wondering what you do with the phones you review. I really hate asking for free things but my daughters sweet 16 in in 1 week and right now I&#39;m not finacalliy able to buy her one after my wife died I&#39;ve been working 3 jobs just to pay the bills and if it would be possible to give me one a samsung or apple would work best but if you cant that&#39;s ok, but if you could it would make her year and my year. Hi I followed your recommendation to join the VPN Shark used the VPN then decided to install the Security product, and then I cannot access the internet no matter what I tried, then I uninstalled the security product and did not uninstall, then had to turn to windows retore funct, luckily this was available.. Wasted 3-4hours of my time.. I run windows 11  23H2.. Very bad experience I have requested refund let see whether they honor there own policy.. iPad, iPen, ikeyboard useless stuff ever....<br><br>Between, iPen with vibrating features, ladies please note 😂 So the same guy who complained about paying 700 USD to the AI pin now says paying the price more than 5 times as high as the device make sense and being excited. what a waste of money. great for my white female friends ipad should really ... just run mac. He really sucked that smart toothbrush.. Buy ipad I am get galaxy tab<br> A8 I guess if you&#39;re into the Apple ecosystem you might be moved. Listening to you felt like deja vu inside my head about my 2-year old, 14&quot;, 5.6mm Galaxy Tab 8 Ultra. Replaced both my laptop and my reMarkable 2. OLED masterpiece. Correctly positioned camera. Executes Windows via DeX like a champ. Phone chip or not, it edits video flawlessly.  You&#39;ve got to hand it to Apple for &#39;inventing&#39; years-old stuff! Oh, BTW: about 50% of the high-end iPrice. I’m not hearing you out, video skipped<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>jk lol Ok I&#39;m an apple user but instead of getting ipad i got samsung galaxy tab s9 ultra because samsung dex is something which is most advanced as per ipad os and it let us beyond where we can use tablet as an laptop. I also have an macbook but when i need to take for lighter use i can go with my tab. I don&#39;t know about you people but as per my perspective ipad is just waste of money. I support this product. It‘s not for everyone. The iPad pro is for designers and people who really need to work with a tablet, which I am not. If you just want a tablet to watch Netflix, you can always buy an iPad air. <b>*****</b> I want 16” iPad with 4TB <b>*****</b> You got conned. The M1 macbook air is sufficient for most cases. Sponsor: ReMarkable Its another useless product just like smart watches to distract you from your real life Arun, you sound like you&#39;re trying to justify the purchase to yourself. C&#39;mon man, $3600 for a tablet? My opinion is you&#39;re losing touch with reality. $3600!! You&#39;re essentially saying you&#39;ll literally pay ANYTHING for a tiny bit more convienence... oh and btw... your &quot;massive heavy laptop&quot; isn&#39;t really is it.... love you man but this video got me triggered,. Easy, dude. He could easily make back $3600 and more by releasing a video on it. @@WahPiang that’s not the point he’s making Because he makes a ton of money from YT so he will buy every useless sheet nomatter how expensive it is, i perso bought the Honor magic6pro because it&#39;s cheaper than iPhone 16 pro or Galaxy 25 ultra and can do what their rivals can&#39;t, like air gestures, and 3D face unlock How is this losing touch with reality? You’re only getting salty because you can’t afford it. And why are you triggered.. at a tech channel.. buying the latest tech? It’s literally his job. <br><br>It’s also his money. Stop being triggered of other people’s purchases. It’s ridiculous. @@0hkie can’t I? Ok. @@0hkiedid you watch the video? His angle for the video is justifying why $3600 for an iPad is in fact good value. Oh which amounted to, it’s a bit more convenient to carry. Are you forgetting apple as a corporation pitch their products to maximise revenue? Charging the maximum they think consumers will accept to pay? Well I say $3600 for an iPad is far too expensive and I’m triggered because Arun as a respected tech reviewer seems to believe this is quite acceptable - it isn’t. @@MrHappyjollyit’s quite of an expensive tablet indeed, but maybe for him it is justified to pay that price instead of new MacBook … he is doing review and also can have his own opinion that’s all ❤ @@DominikZagar yep and I’m offering an alternate opinion and i’m saying 3600 for a tablet is just racketeering. This video is trying to justify it and I don’t think he did a good job, which is impossible because 3600 is not justifiable. Watch his follow up video, it doesn’t work! The ridiculous way how apple pencil place to the iPad always make me chuckle. Can it run OBS for streamers/youtubers ? DONE MESS WITH SAMSUNG BOI I don’t think this is it, even as a avid Apple user this is just not it What a cool way to sleep on the street 😂 The bank after this video:<br>AHHHHHHH IM TURNING INTO PALM NIIIII AGHHHHWHSHSH😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱➖ Yes My only concern is when you expect this to work as your macbook. M4 will be soaked in heat way more quickly than in macbook air. In other words they position the M4 iPad Pro as a macbook pro seller. Yes, there will be overheat and clock throttling problems down the line of this. Fake news you didn’t spend $3600 cause you didn’t buy it yet! Where is your M4 iPad you were talking bout? Stop lying and scamming! apple fanboy Yea, but a pit pointless, i will forever put a protective  tempered  glass and case on any device i have, especially  if it is that thin, one drop, and it&#39;s done 3.6k lost. (Im clumsy, so i need it, but for those who are not clumsy at all ...lucky...) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=568\">9:28</a> .... blackout 😅 We&#39;re still waiting on software. Hardware is on point, but until we get closer to something like DeX, its not ready. Its a common complaint for years now. I suppose the idea of the iPad actually being useful is spreading throughout the whole user base over the span of the design iteration. I happen to be in the high expectations, high disappointment camp. My main issue is always old pc habits.. i dont know why they keep making it thinner... especially when everybody is just going to slap a huge case on it because the damn thing snaps in half like a twig... A person having S23 ultra doesn&#39;t need this, it&#39;s big enough to fulfill all the needs and also has it&#39;s stylus built-in to the body 😂😂 I mean if someone wants to develop apple apps you probably can&#39;t access Desktop apps on a Ipad like Xcode and You wouldn&#39;t be able to run Virtual machine like Windows on Linux operating systems. A Laptop would be better since you can change the operating system and have more storage. I don&#39;t think Ipad is good for desktop applications whether on Macos or windows. What a waste Bro just get a smaller laptop, why do you have the biggest heaviest laptop Apple make that&#39;s just ridiculous. Putting an M4 in an iPad is like putting an RTX 4090 in a fridge 😂 Man spends $3600, uses the device once then keeps it in a drawer for 5 years before throwing it away 😂 Apple is too proud to copy the surface kick stand. Such an obvious addition to any tablet. This is such a cope, iPad failed. Let&#39;s just be honest about it now. Your problem is that you have a ridiculously large laptop, get a 10&quot; GPD Winmax 2 2023, super powerful, tiny, yet it&#39;s a real very portable computer. You can get a Galaxy Tab S6 Lite for 10% the cost and it comes with a pen 😂 can you run Windows on the Ipad? or a Virtual machine on the Ipad? I want to run Windows Desktop Applications and use virtual machine. It makes sense, those Netflix videos require a super computer 😂🤡 Do the bend test with apple care just in case Can you pick me one up to fully loaded with all the accessories What was bro doing with that toothbrush Why did he spend that much? Because he&#39;s rich, has sponsors, and it&#39;s fully tax deductible for him. MK did say it best. Its still a Ipad no matter whats under the hood. You boot it up and you have Ipad OS. I have a M2 12.9 and Newest Pencil before the Pro was announced. So Im good for a replacement for a couple generations. Word of advise. if you can afford the Ipad he just bought. Get the macbook pro M3 with all the bells and whistles. Nobody uses MacBook unless your a youtuber @@richdollars8337 This is true. But just from these 2 products. You’ll get more bang for your buck getting a MBpro. It may be a Mac but it’s still a computer as opposed to a tablet pretending to be. That’s all I meant. @@richdollars8337 Around half the people in my university cohort use a MacBook, including me. This is also the case for most of the universities in the UK. Yeah I hate when people say this the same argument can be said about the MacBooks they are useless because you can’t play any of the good games and your spending the same price. What do you really need from the MacBook that can’t be done with a iPad if you’re not an editor or YouTuber. What is the name of the game? the case will have to be heavier than the ipad stuck to it or it will topple backward. Doesn&#39;t the macs with m chips support just iPad OS apps?? If you have something like a computer you don’t need a new iPod maybe they upgrade Ipad os more closely to MacOs or maybe making it even same to it so they can Preform just like a macbook if so that would be amazing since M4 used on it Exact reason apple will not introduce macbook with touch screen because they want you to spend more money on an ipad for the convenience of removing the keyboard.. something youtuber tech reviewers will not call out apple for.. No hate to mrwhosetheboss but<br>Someone who has just enough budget for macbook shouldn’t have to spend 3k more for an ipad maybe I wrong but just an opinion <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=437\">7:17</a> What game is that? I get you bro this is worth it cause athough it is a mobile device but can also do all the tasks a macbook does without any hick as well. That what i need, going to start saving money to buy it. It&#39;s the ton part of the 2024 Macbook with a touchscreen It looks Apple will continue to limit powerful M4 iPad Pro with the SW which is a bummer. iPad (at least Pro) needs to seriously open its capabilities and approach Mac like experience. Apple is loosing another great chance to grow its user base with these completely ridiculous and stupid limitations. Waiting for the Apple iPad calculator for 15 years isn&#39;t how they should utilize their incredible HW and chips. Nice to see Brandon in the video Ipad would never replace a macbook for users like programmers. it&#39;s is not a full OS after all and dedicated for specialized users. I bought Xiomi pad 6 pro for around 400$ and more than happy about it!<br>no need to overspend for tablet... iPad pros will be pointless until they the give it MacOS Does it have a Calculator? Enjoy I simply wish one will just put it forward that Apple is Terrible. This was a boring one 13 inches? LOL yuk. That&#39;s not a laptop replacement. I wouldn’t be surprised if the new version of iPadOS will be just be macOS with a couple features removed. It does feel like the iPad Pro line are now being made as a smaller MacBook without being called a MacBook &quot;apple didn&#39;t Want To Buy This Tablet Over Mackbook They Want You To Buy Both&quot; Hits Different😂😂😂😂😂 Get a VOXI sim if you go cellular. Impressive technology. But still just an overpriced gimmick. Why? So you could show us too many ads throughout this video, of course. <br><br>Congrats on your new toy, btw. شغل عالي Even if i was the richest, I would no way throw my money on this product. No way worth it! I love my iPad Pro and the upgrades are amazing!  Why do you say it can ONLY do HALF of what iPad can do?  Tell me what???? Apple seems to be the choice for angry, unsecure people who dont enjoy freedom and dont embrace diversity. first time with a magic keyboard bro? shilling hard are we Can you make a video about Huawei Pura 70 I’m watching this on an iPad Wait when did you got married?? Do another video after using it for awhile please? It shd have full OS too This is such an ad. This guy is talking like he just discovered the iPad and hasn’t been a tech YouTuber for years.

Epic. I started with computers 1980, punch cards... Apple ][, Amiga 1000, lots of PCs. Where am I today? I truly and utterly HATE Windows10 (and refuses win11). I have a USB-C hub to mouse, keyboard, ethernet, speakers and a nice large monitor. I jack in my Samsung Note10+ and get a full desktop of my phone, that solves all task handling, emails, calenders, surfing, Netflix, Youtube etc. I can jack in my iPad Pro and use that as well, very convinient. Or I plug in my work laptop for working. It separates life cleanly and is very simple. Then on my ethernet I have a large NAS where all files are located and synced to. The iPad was bought mainly for the PEN! Drawing and painting, scribbling and writing, but large portion of all media consumption is on the iPad. I will probably not by another PC and never ever Windows based. I have a few Linux setups and they solve most of all tasks I cannot do on the Samsung phone or iPad. It is very convenient to use Proxmox and virtual Linux servers and desktops. As for the iPad, buy the PEN! Buy the magic keyboard! It is expensive, but is is a fantastic mouse pad and keyboard. why is this the most disliked video ive watched so far, I got the extension a month ago 9.1k!!! So this guy doesn&#39;t have a workflow that warrants a Macbook Pro, so he&#39;s ok with going to an iPad... Ok Me spent €1000 on the M1 Pro years ago. I haven’t gone back to MacBook since then &quot;It&#39;s just as fast, except for anything with loading bars. Those are 50% as fast.&quot; lol they should have made a min 14&quot; perhaps 16&quot; iPad Pro line up for real Pro users and sizes below 14&quot; should have been Air line for general consumers.<br>To create artistic content like you need larger screen to contain toolbars + content window. I Worked before on really small MacBook Air 13&quot; screen, it can be done but requires too many zoom in and outs during the process.<br><br> I managed it  but it’s not possible to do with same size iPad Pro,  because on laptop:<br>1- when you use a tablet like Wacom, your hand is not blocking half of your view. Wacom screens are also bigger. <br>2- you got keyboard so you can continuously alter the files you work on without distrubting your workflow with the tablet pencil you use. Not to mention you dont need to look where you click with keyboard, where as on iPad you have to look where you click all the time. This is such a slow process.<br><br>Magic keyboard is awful, its right infront of the screen so you  basically have one hand on screen while other one is on the keyboard. Terrible ergonomics.<br>Just sayin.. The only reason I&#39;m in for tablets is their freaky performance and screen size. Like, wow, they are CRAZY fast. Local storage would still be an issue. Backups to iCloud or an external drive albeit expensive don’t let you load apps directly from the cloud…YET…so if you’re really doing everything showcased here including FCP stored clips and renderings the local storage would max fairly quickly; which was briefly alluded to but not as specifically called out at the very end of the video Ayo that toothbrush🫣 I really like this style of videos from you! It&#39;s good background listening material while doing other things, like a short podcast :) If i dont pay any bills or buy anything for 3 months, no food, no gas, etc. Then i would be able to buy a 3600 tablet. What about the repair an iPad? It’s way too thin , it would bend so easily , I don’t think people care for a super thin tablet . Apple needs to stop what should i buy, celluar or wifi? Remember iPhone 6 bend gate For the likes and subscribes? Does the nano texture make the pencil feel different based on friction? You talk way to much Yo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> that was straight up a violation LMAO but can it run Crysis? you have too much money😢 And stuck with iPadOS, nice I suppose Ipad Os still doesn&#39;t really allow you to code on it without going through so much hurdles. Someone give me this kind? Because you’re a rich YouTuber who will make money on this video. That’s why. now we can play Candy Crush in 8K😂 من جاي بفيديو دراغونوف 😂😂😂😂 please stop using bots to cheat youtube, its not fair on other content creators.... So you are boasting that you spent nearly $4k on a tablet that should cost no more than $1500? Why would some one spent this much I&#39;ll do with samsung Nice ad I&#39;m sorry but a tablet has no business being that expensive... Go ahead and buy car and leave ipad for applefanboy 😅🤣 So now i phone gonna realise thaire phone world most slimmest phone ever😮😮😮 im worried the processing power won&#39;t be able to keep up with non apple softwares like davinci resolve and photoshop.

And because he&#39;ll make more then that off the video. The title is disingenuous. I think it’s more like I’m rich and can make videos of this xD. Not just one review Recently I&#39;ve stopped watching MRWTB videos... They are flashy, really well made etc... But core reason why I&#39;ve watched his videos were cause of my decisions should I buy this or that product... Now it&#39;s... I run benchmark on mobile. It overheats, it&#39;s really bad phone.. (Meanwhile Serbian Youtube Channel called Benchmark did do pretty professional review of the same phone where they did mention overheat on 3d Mark benchmark I think, they still showed how phone doesn&#39;t have any problems with any games, overheating or daily use outside that same benchmark. highly recommended it while MRWTB was sceptical of it by not doing properly something that almost nobody uses and doesn&#39;t have any use...)<br><br>So yeap... Flashing products, money and doing for videos for views and money isn&#39;t that cool to look at anymore. @@ddrfreak4578maybe for you but to the other millions of people that watch his vids it seems they find them entertaining 😂 your just hating on him to try to advertise the other guys yt channel and mrwtb vids are filled with a lot of useful info @@ddrfreak4578 You should never base your decision buying a product based on any video, especially just one video.\\xa0Go into forums, read user stories and experiences, this kind of issue will be talked about by users. <br>I always source on google for &quot;the name of the product&quot; + issue/problem. <br>And If you can&#39;t find enough information from real users it&#39;s a sign you need to wait longer. \\u200b@@ddrfreak4578- I can&#39;t agree more. Less info and more gimmicks Because MrWhoseTheBoss is an Apple super fan (or being rewarded by Apple) and thus there will never be a price point which he would say things are getting ridiculous? I think he’s focused on lifestyle. We understand the technical, but I watched this for an informed opinion on how does he feel it will fit into his life. As when you have the money for it, it’s the practical that matters. It’s the feeling I want him to convey. I can search the benchmarks easily. What I want is his opinion on how this fits into the ce ecosystem MRWTB videos still looks like a apple fan not able to review impartially !

He has also called out certain iPhones in the past. Wouldn’t go as far to say that he’s just a fanboy for them imo. a very nice one lol i have one built for around 3500-600 euro haha Sponsored by us, we bring the views and revenue 😅 I mean he might be right or wrong Nerfed Macbook Arun, i thought you of all people would know apples business model by now considering the fact that you&#39;re neck deep into the apple eco system. Do you know why the iPhones are never as good at multitasking when compared to androids despite being just as powerful, if not arguably more? Because sales on the ipad would drop (wguch is apples solution for multitasking on the mobile side), do you know why they&#39;d never give the ipads the same functionality as macbooks? Because the macbook is the end all be all for all of apples products (better screens, better performance, better speakers). It&#39;s one the reasons why the galaxy tab doesnt sell as much as the ipads. Most people that have a galaxy dont need a galaxy tab since the phone can do everything, if not more, than the galaxy tab can do, especially the ultra phones. Do you want portability? get an iPhone, You want portability but with better multitasking than the iPhone? Get an ipad. You want the overall best, but dont care about portability? Get a macbook. Apple has given you a reason to get all these devices without letting you have an inbetween. So to answer your question about apple physically handicapping their devices, the answer is yes, yes they do. Apple would never give the same type of functionality the ipad has to the iPhone, and neither would they give the same functionality that the macbook has to the ipad. Unless sales of the ipad drop unbelievably low, then maybe, but in already apple fashion, if the sales ever dropped so low, they&#39;d just end the ipad line up. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=40\">0:40</a> 🤨🤨🤨🤨😂😂😂😭😭😭 I actually use a Galaxy Fold phone and have a Samusng Tab S7+ tablet. I used to have a Surface Pro 6 tablet that had a cracked screen. I utilized my protection plan and traded it for the Samsung tab. We are the opposite of each other. I HATE when a company says &quot;use the app!&quot; for simple things that a web page would have been perfect for. I usually look for another service in that case. I am a medical student. I want to buy an ipad for cls,  note taking,  studying pdf and making presentation. <br>Which one should be good for me?  11 inch model or 13 inch. <br>New Apple User here. Go for the smaller one, more portable, you can take it anywhere. And when text/image is small, just zoom in. An absolut must is to install Goodreader Pro and synch it to your cloud service (Dropbox, Onedrive, etc.) - it&#39;s a game changer for using documents (especially pdf). @Mrwhosetheboss, please tone down or remove the background music  in your videos which are distracting. Thanks Not the toothbrush clip Samsung will come out with something better or just as good and it will have a fair price. I really don&#39;t understand the brand loyalty a lot of people have with Apple products it&#39;s borderline cult behavior. the whole idea of an computer replacement crashes in the moment, you get to know this ipadOs. So far, the older ipad pros since the 2018 model are as capable and nearly as fast in daily use, as this new ones. It&#39;s not the hardware that has to improve. it&#39;s the software. Can you try tecno go spark 2024? Look forward to Zach literally folding this thing in half. great ad - except i think it missed the &quot;ad&quot; notice Wth 3600$ no IPad should be over 500$ There is no but ! When people will boycott apple ? It’s amazing how all these insecure Samsung fanboys obsess more over new Apple products than people that are actually interested in buying those Apple products. You guys really need to get a life. It’s pathetic at this point. I’m going to get the iPad Pro M4 11 Inch model for Christmas or the new iPad Air but my first choice is the M4 iPad Pro Don’t be fooled, it cannot replace your laptop even with the keyboard Doing basically everything you describe already on my 500$ Tab S7 FE Sooo you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re better off buying a $1000 laptop for school/work + a $500 tablet for entertainment instead of one $3600 fragile piece of glass that locks you into their overpriced ecosystem? yer completely disagree with you here, first off for me to even think of buying a tablet it has to be cheaper then my laptop not more expansive and the small perks you said dont out weight the what i can do on a laptop at all i dont care about a camera on the back of it nothing here sold me the only thing i got from this clip is that you can afford crap that i cant so its already if you waste money. please walk down the aisle with your laptop in your hand That is crazy thin and super powerful. Whenever you replace your MacBook I would gladly accept it 😂 Where’s the ultrawide camera? love this advisement! 🎉 Why no reviews for iqoo 12 was curious about it This is a youtube shorts kids dream 😂 hooray! it is now a laptop! just a bit more expensive 2 TR bites wow Same old story😅 Apple is actually Better than Samsung Bro, he’s so close to passing Apple Wow I’m impressed Brain washed people are gonna buy it for that price. 😂 Dude’s secretly launched the foldable iPad’s.. The fact that you can also transfer your notes and everything from an iPad to a MacBook and vice versa easily is scary good. huh ? you can do this with any computer.. are you a time traveler from 2002 ? \\u200b@@EricBarthDevWhat time travel machine is he using? Is it from Apple? Remember folks PC and Android has done it first before Apple. 😊😂 Well i paid £800 for a second hand Samsung S9 perfect condition with a slim keyboard cover and warranty until April 2026. I love it but thought that was a high price The only program I don&#39;t think work very well on a tablets is excel and Word. Hakki abiyi farkedenler 😅😅<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=735\">12:15</a> What&#39;s the other tablets beside macbook guys its the copy of microsoft surface air pros series just check it <br>Apple has copied the surface pros design Don’t get it, mainly 😢😮 because they want (Ata&amp;T does, I don’t know about the other big 2 competitors) to charge you $50 to $100 dollars for data sharing. <br><br>Instead of giving you unlimited like they do with all of the other cellular devices.<br><br>$50-$60 for 50 gigs, $90-$100 for 100 gigs.  So, if you get the 2tb 13”iPad, that retails for $2599 with 10% tax your looking at $2859. That’s about $73 every month for 3 years at AT&amp;T plus an additional $100 a month for 100 gigs, plus insurance that $200 a month easy.<br><br>The fact that you can’t get unlimited data is preposterous. Nice Apple advertisement. You should indicate in the description or somewhere. congrats!!!  right before the major recession! You&#39;re the smart one. I use the desktop version of adobe photoshop with a pressure sensitive Wacom tablet for higher end retouching (eg photos I take for skincare companies). Would that workflow be possible on the iPad? Because mobile versions are great for regular edits and colour grading but when it comes to intensive retouch I really don’t know if it can hold up. Any thoughts or alternatives for this specific niche purpose? Can&#39;t wait for the 3 month review where he goes back to mbp and sells this overspecced bs I got my self an iPad Pro and now my desktop and laptop are collecting dust as it has Logic Pro on it. i have an ipad air 4 i regret it it&#39;s useless remember IT&#39;S NOT A LAPTOP IT AS AN USLESS SOFTWARE AND IT SUCKS DONT BUY IT I WASTED SO MUCH MONEY IT&#39;S LITTERALI A BIG IPHONE you can&#39;t install any apps games etc. you have to use the mobile version of every single app IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE WAS DEEP THROATING THE TOOTH BRUSH Cause Apple paid you way more 😂😂 He said he was hesitant to buy the Samsung tablet cuz it uses a phone chip but every othe advantage he mentions that tablets have is cuz they use phone like apps lol. And Apple bumped up the size of their bigger Pro to better compete with Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Tab Ultra. It would be interesting to see a comparison since the Tabs also have DeX.<br><br>But over $3000 is insane for a tablet. Thats more than most high end laptops! Makes me wonder how much the most expensive M4 MacBook Pro will be whenever it comes out. You can buy the best Pc possible for 4k and this ipad is 3600, which is mind blowing Video Idea: Buying the most Elastic Tech Man \\uf8ff can’t stop A total rip off!  An iPad should never be more than $1000. I had this exact epiphany as well, I brought and sold tablets thinking that it would replace the laptop but it never really did but this year I did go ahead and give it a shot and then it really worked out well and I was actually quite surprised that we had such similar ideas on this. But yeah it&#39;s been a great experience it actually recommend using Android as well No one seems to consider that with carrier deals, or trade ins, no one will probably actually pay that price tag. Let’s see first thing he said  is weight  lol yea that a one reason to spend a small car price. Weight? Uhm he certainly can afford it. Ok it takes over his actual computer because of weight. One thing Apple quality is best. However is it worth the price. He’ll no. How many time he mentioned weight and size.oh let’s not forget games now. He is gushing red alert. Did Apple hire him. They should if not. please dont be a fool, and stop fooling people as well. How much did they pay for this advertised message? Apple managed to blind yet another tech content creator... You are now worse than MKHBD.... Samsungs S pen from 2019 was more advanced, and it was given with a $600 phone (instead of a $3600 worse version of laptop) Now try a bend test. Being rickrolled on your first scene is WILD😂 We have a saying in Serbia, &quot;Disease is not just what hurts&quot; Great Video! Great Points! You have a new subscriber. I was hoping I could go down to one device (get rid of the MacBook Air) I am a little disappointed that the keyboard is not detachable from the cover but hopefully it is light enough to carry around. I guess we will have to see … Thanks! Meh. What are you gonna do on it watch YouTube? It ridiculous how much tech costs now. The iPhone should not be over £700. They just go up every year in price and Apple just epext everyone to pay more as if people earn more every year You can by super powered desktop PC for $3600.  I mean the only reason I would consider and iPad is for Procreate. Also Apple could have a touch screen computer or an iPad that can run full software... but they want you to buy two devices.  They are very smart with when it comes to getting people roped into buying more. I still do not think an iPad can replace a desktop or laptop computer, but like I said they do not want you to buy one or the other... they want you to own both.<br>Gaming on a mobile device or a Mac simply is a long was off to what a PC or console can do. Unless you just want to play mobile apps. compared to other reviews idk but this feels sponsored, wired move aruan? We will be Android for ever Does bro get paid by both apple and samsung?😭 Apple didn&#39;t make iPadOS &quot;simpler&quot;, they are restricting our freedom to run macOS on iPad, heck I bet you could run macOS on a newest iPhone More CRAP from Apple <br>reviewed by the ultimate isheep! Sorry, but this feels like an ad. Not sure why you are so overwhelmed all of a sudden since this generation and the M1 are basically the same thing. Video idea:  Video on the current LARGEST cellphones on the market.  For the visually impaired,  and or people who want large scaled screens. Ciao! Avrei bisogno di un cellulare che abbia un ottimo audio, che abbia una ottima batteria, che regga l&#39;utilizzo continuo di chiamate e e-mail, dai 350 ai 450. Cosa mi consiglieresti? Another CTRL+C, CTRL+P by APPLE. Shot this video morning &#39;till night. Bravo!👏🏼🤣 I think I should sell one of my lungs Disappointed you switched to a Google Galaxy phone. Touchwiz is so bad So there&#39;s a new category called Tabtop? A Tablet that replaces the Laptop. 1min20. Great statement ever! IPads? Just one 12.9 M1 is enough for me. But if they made specific use pads or tablets for secretaries to get the boss&#39;s signatures, or for medical uses like in Star Trek, now THAT would be an entirely new market! You heard it here first! I think it was BECUZ you can, i cant even get myself to touch a apple product, i did about 10 years ago and i still feel dirty.<br>And i sure as hell can not pay the price they demand. All this was available innsamsung tab s9 ultra :) Overpriced junk Watching this video even if i will never buy this in my lifetime because i will never afford this 😂 I buy a iPad to play mobile games,  no to use like a laptop Get a Samsung Android. I think the iPad pro camera would be the next iPhone 16 back camera layout Yeah, another shiny way to castrate the internet even more. bro forgor about people who dont have phones or ipads and need websites to exist I find annoying this whole situation because a 1TB iPad cost more than my brand new alienware laptop with the highest intel card, and highest graphic card that plays 4K video games. I REALLY WANT this new iPad because besides gaming and making 3D animations I love drawing and dumping my iPhone pictures from my travels on it. But a 1TB M3 iPad cost double as the alienware. 🙃 I don’t like that Apple is choosing to test its costumers with high prices and see who is willing to pay them. Right now I’ll wait for a discount to buy one TBH. Not related but a request please. Summer time is here. Party speakers look interesting. What is the best value for money? RGB, rollable and amazing sound quality? Gee……for a top notch tech reviewer……he didn’t cover the memory aspect? Long story short, he bought a tablet that&#39;s so ludicrously costly because he can pay for it and earn way more by making a video on it. Truth it is. Bro check oppo find x7 ultra it can buy my laptop 4 times Gaming on a Mac 😂…full stop. To much money. Waste money for 99% of people😂😂 ngl, bought an m1 ipad pro back in 2021, still bought a macbook pro in december last year. Nothing can replace a laptop. I see a lot of people hating on the iPad pros now because of there extremely high expensive price tags but they have always been that way. I personally don’t buy new iPad pros every year, I generally buy a new one every two years but depends on what it has to offer. And for iPhone pro max, I generally buy one every year but again, depends on what they offer in terms of changes/ new features. I prefer Apple over android because of their design quality. The difference to the M2 iPad pro isn&#39;t so much that it can now replace a MacBook completely and can&#39;t before 😅 also you are still missing whole office implementation with word, PowerPoint and Excel. I bought a M1 ipad pro with the magic keyboard and imagined I&#39;d use it for everything but in reality I&#39;m still on my desktop all day as it&#39;s so much quicker LOL, today my wife, who has a 2018 iPad Pro that can do 90% of the stuff in this video, ordered a reMarkable tablet after seeing it here. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=491\">8:11</a> “really massive laptop”<br>Really bro? Really? at this point its just a nerfed macbook pro its been a month since i tried to recover my account and apple still hasnt reached out to me to let me access my account The most elaborate Apple Ipad Advertisement, But no matter what anyone says to me No feature can convince that price tag. many things are just showoff ill get a ipad when it allows me to do coding and development work which will prob never hapen So Samsung tab is wayyyy better 😂 That is tim cook strategy. Because apple sales is dropping so they need to raise the price so they can compensate with their overhead expenses. Its not the quality of the product and specs you are paying anymore Just preordered the iPad Air 2024 m2 stapping over from the iPad mini 6 gen 16 min to get a 3 minute message across &quot;Exciting unboxing and review of the Viy OPEI P30U by Mrwhosetheboss! Subscribe for more tech content and don&#39;t forget to hit the like button - definitely worth checking out! &quot; Simple answer: because you are rich AF Exactly! If they could spend just a few months thinking of a way to revolutionize tablet operating systems in a way that made them feel like not just a giant iPod.. This thing with its hardware specs could actually possibly be portable powermachine you could bring with you to the coffee house  and leave your laptop at work to charge and not risk an unexpected MacOS (or Win 11) update). REALLY not a big Apple guy... seriously, I&#39;m from Alabama.. not New York, but unfunny dad jokes aside... does so one else think this? I love smart phone operating systems, I love computer operating systems! Tablet Operating Systems.. just seems like iOS couldn&#39;t change into something wonderful during its transition to MacHood... I thought u had me Apple.. at OLED, 4K, some screen texture or something lol, skipping 2 processor numbers because you think multiplying a number by 2 defines the revolutionary processing evolvement as seen in your ancesteor&#39;s you abandoned a long time ago just because.. you couldn&#39;t process the truth nobody will every know how to invent a productive, fun and useful OS for that gawky shameful frame of a freakish iPoMacan&#39;tosh. Is this video sponsored by Apple or smth? 💀 Guys quickly sub to Arun, he is only 4 million away from overtaking apples sub, don&#39;t forget Arun made a promise of creating a phone with the best parts of every phone&#39;s Guys i am an idiot sooo yea I bought it and cool fact i am 15 ………. Because you can afford it ? “Hope it comes with a built-in money-making app to help recoup that investment! 😄” It still won&#39;t play real games like Cyberpunk 2077 on ultra high settings with ray tracing. So for the same cost I&#39;ll stay with my PC I think. &quot;Why you spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.&quot;?  Dont be a soyboy, just answer: &quot;because I can! Greed. They asked for $3600. Why bother? Just ignore! By X&#39;mas they price down, and then soon another launch, recycling old design and find excuses to launch gimmicky features to increase prices. Same marketing ploys, iBored! Apple still think all customers are nerds and dummies. Wake up, Apple! In this economy, $3600 can do a lot of meanful things! Your laptop is far better then 1M iPads. The iPad cost is disheartening.  Unless they open the iPad to other use cases ie use it as a phone and sync my watch or align more to the Mac side of the house they will still be in a space that nobody gets and everyone spends the money then the iPad sits what game is at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=518\">8:38</a> ? The iPad is far more versatile than any laptop. If you compare task per task you will easily see that a laptop is a very old and outdated platform. On iPad every app works in the App Store, it’s a notepad, pc, mirror of your phone, touchscreen, and best screen. This is more expensive than my slav- i mean workers As always the iPad pros has all the bells and whistles, but unfortunately the software will always hold it back.<br><br>They will never sell Mac books if they empower the iPad pros. I think the iPad Mini is the perfect tablet size. It can replace the iPhone for streaming and games without feeling too big. bro one slip and its over Because you are rich and make even more money by reviewing it lolz I thinks....... BEST PRESENT EVER!!!<br>Family thinks....... YouTube might load a little faster on this Meh... nahh<br>vision pro or ipad<br>(same $$$) Spending 3600$ for kids<br>Kids throwing iPad 🥲 M16 chip gonna be 🔥 bro started the video in the morning and ended in the night😅😅 the way arun uses smart toothbrush is SUS😂 Bro forgot that, M Series Chips also Mobile Chips 😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> Ayooooo! iOS needs their own Dex Mode F Apple, but this video sounds interesting. Someone make a gif of that “smart toothbrush” shot. Asking for a friend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=41\">0:41</a> Request: - Can you make a video on the Infinix GT 20 pro? Not running Mac OS is still a deal breaker for me. My M1 Ipad Pro has been sitting in my closet. I bought it maxed out when it was released, but ended up hardly using it. I need full OS, not iPad OS. That nano coating is very likely a very dumb idea seeing as it appears fragile. There already exist very reasonably priced screen protectors that provide a paper-like writing experience &amp; a matte finish. That nano screen seems like a complete waste of money. And in a twist of irony, you could use a portable Samsung SSD as external storage. Oh the dongle life Desperately in need of 18 dollar...  For my exam😢 Still not worth it. I noticed that Samsung Ultra phones have Samsung DEX mode - this is when you connect your phone to a screen and a keyboard with mouse - and you got a desktop experience from a mobile phone!<br><br>I gave it a try and my conclusion is: it can replace my work laptop used mostly for zoom and teams meetings. The only thing I find annoying is that in DEX mode the phone cannot make use of an external webcamera that I use with Zoom.<br><br>Otherwise all the other apps - are nearly identical to Windows PC experience: powerpoint, outlook, teams, zoom, etc.<br><br>It is incredible how close the mobile devices came cto replace laptops. I have used my my s22 ultra for about year as a laptop. I only had problem at campus, now I am using tab s9+ and s22 ulta together and never wanted to go laptop in all honesty, neither an ipad nor a phone with desktop mode can replace an actual working computer. sure they all can watch youtube but at the end of the day if you&#39;re gonna use productivity apps you&#39;re better off with a pc. @@adorableredfox if you define productivity apps as office 365, teams and zoom - yes, DEX mode can do that just fine. @@adorableredfox you are right bro. Laptop has no use for me. So tablet is just fine Laptops stayed relevant because if OS It&#39;s funny how I&#39;ve had the exact oposite thinking from you on tablets vs phones. After the pandemic I started working from home and I barely go out now, so there&#39;s no point in spending a lot of money on a smartphone, I rather spend on an iPad, have a better and bigger screen and sound and have a cheap phone for when I go out. +1 <br><br>And you can always hot spot any phone to the tablet for data / internet People better get AppleCare+…..😅 No offense but your review seems kinda biased . How about the charger 😢 Phone apps better than desktop apps... Yikes, that&#39;s a unique take. Credibility has taken a hit. Don&#39;t want to lose that Apple access! sir what you think about huwayei pura 70 ultra? I&#39;m amazed at people like JRE&#39;s obsession with equating things having the ability to be bent in half if you REALLY try with all your might means its a bad product. He&#39;s been rolling with this clickbait for so long for easy clicks but its never once actually mattered in my use of a product. Lets stop acting like it matters unless it happens in everyday life. <br><br>I have the iPhone 15 Pro Max which I almost didn&#39;t get cus he said its so flimsy and will bend easily.... well its been how many months now and Its never even been a thought. I know why: Because you are one of the leading tech reviewers on YouTube, and NOT buying one would mean losing out on millions of views and potential subscriptions this video will generate for you. <br><br>You have to buy this to be able to long-term test it to create this video, to stay relevant. <br><br>You can also write off this iPad to boot. Simple. I don&#39;t understand this sentence: &quot;You can also write off this iPad to boot.&quot;<br>what do you mean by this? Tax write off since it’s used for work Mane mane mane Sure since he is a tech YouTuber he needs to buy everything Apple puts out.. but you gotta listen to him and understand his points too. The point of replacing his current daily-use tech, the progression of tablet technology and its relevance in today&#39;s world etc etc. Those points are something which are key to the video He really doesn’t need to write it off for #1 he can return it and get his money back after he does some reviews and get the cheaper one if he really wants to keep one after but mostly with the amount of views he creates that video more than probably paid for \\u200b@@jasonross2513 Do you think that means &quot;free&quot;? Whats the point?? It cannot do anything close to a full macbook pro how dare you compare remarkable with the stupid apple crap You are rambling saying a whole bunch of nothing lol. There&#39;s literally been no justification for that price at all. Do yourself a favor get the best tablet ever Samsung tab s9 for a fraction of the cost and way better features AYOOOOO that toothbrush technique is crazy One thing that I’m super disappointed is that but the Air M2 and iPad Pro M4 doesn’t support Apple Pencil 2, but it supports the lower end USB-C Pencil.  So if I were to upgrade and get either one, I need spend another $130 for a pencil.  The second disappointment is that there are two different Magic Keyboards for the Air and Pro: the Air doesn’t have a function role and have smaller keys like the ESC and Delete, but cost the same as the Pro keyboard.<br><br>I don’t feel like a need a Magic Keyboard and I’m just as happy using my full-sized foldable keyboard and trackball when I need a computer like setup.  But I use Apple Pencil a lot, so I’m on the fence instead of upgrading my Air 4, I will wait another two years for a new Air or maybe a Pro.  Or should I get a new Air and Pencil Pro…? Can&#39;t believe even this guy just start to be a fanboy... Crazy how Apple just see and does everything for the fanboys... Although i wasn&#39;t expecting Mrwhostheboss becoming the next Tim Cook... problem with most tablets(surface pro excluded) they are saddled with a essentially smartphone OS if they had full fat linux on them they would be far more usefull<br>yes i disagree they are still just big phones 😢in my country a second hand Mercedes Benz C200 costs 2700 Tbh.... I have an iPad pro from like 2 years ago. And I honestly do not use it. It&#39;s the most useless device I have. They need to create iPadOS Pro to get the juice out of these beasts. Bro was really getting in with that toothbrush if you know what I mean 😂 You got to love Apples sales strategy.<br>The Pencil is still only $129.00.😵\\u200d💫😄 All of your use cases sum up to about 2 maybe 3 uses a month imo Why? Because you have the money to buy it $3600 for an iPad Pro as configured?<br><br>Hope you get enough value out of it to justify that price.<br><br>And it only has 16 GB RAM.<br><br>Well, it is very portable… Considering how frequently my M1 Ipad crashes and bugs. It doesn&#39;t matter even if they add a M100. Fix that shitty OS. Make file transfer across pc/phone easier. Provide more free apps. <br>I can buy two a high config PC and a samsung high end tab with that price which doesnt bug that often. So, NO thank you. Only 300,000 subscribers away from overtaking MKBHD and stealing his crown...... 🤔 Starting to become an Apple advertising channel 😢 took Apple only 13 years more than their competitors to implement an Oled screen in their tablets. Oh wait, the &quot;normal&quot; iPads are still LCD, ohwell... down payment on car? or ipad? Your move. What a waste of money He M4 is a phone chip $3400 my goodness 🤔🤭😕😞💀☠️☠️ You could get for the same price a windows gaming laptop for the best games ever, a decent tablet to watch youtube and do some browsing (lets be real, thats what you end up doing with it anyways) and a professional drawing tablet. thas crazy and all but im on a macbook m1 air rn and i cannot genuinely see the difference between the m3, or m4, and m2. really, they are better, get me right, but this macbook can do anything the other macbooks and macs and ipad&#39;s can. Yes yes, but it still has iPadOS. Not going to replace Mac anytime soon. Q: Why Mrwhoseheboss spents $3600 on the iPad Pro M4?<br>A: To show others why he&#39;s the boss. I got my iPad Pro m3 for 100% free Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra Fun fact convert that money it’s costs for that tablet you’ll see in south Africa it’s not nice living here iglad? really?  😂😂 nice video though Why not a surface? iPad Pro isn&#39;t ready until we get a Pro OS - The File system is garbage on the iPad. And let&#39;s not talk about Adobe Creative suite lmao it&#39;s still ipad os... You spent it because you had the money , no other reason. I don’t have the money so i can’t spend on it sadly . Don&#39;t forget that you can also easily pair an apple mouse to iPad now too. I do it regularly. That will cost $10k or more where I live... thats a no from me dawg. The tipping point should come with a complete rebrand. The desktop iMac should revert to Macintosh or Mac (G10 or something) and the portable Mac, which is the iPad should be just called the iMac. In the near future there will be no discernible benefit to a laptop meaning the MacBook can die and just leave us with Mac for desktop and iMac for portability. That is my dream. I still use my iPad 7th over my 13 pro max sometimes. I don’t carry it around outside. Would upgrade to the iPad 10 this year. Ok so you picked up a subscriber. Excellent presentation. Thanks I thought you spent the money to impress the girls.  lol. jk Hi ..ive been watching your videos for almost two years now ill like to request that on your next samsung review please 🙏 ask samsung why isnt good lock on some other countries like south africa while we get the same phone with same chips im currently using a S23 ultra I’m late Just make it a bit thicker so it can have a larger battery. Things have gotten smaller and now things should last longer without charging every few hours. No Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra? 5,1mm? Imagine if they made it 7mm and it had double the battery life You know to make the new iPad better, make a video about the best cases for the new iPad Pro for the 11 -13 inch<br> Like about three for the 11 and 3 for the 13 lime ranging from like least strongest to most strongest Watching on my iPad 2024 - M4 edition ✅ &quot;To review it and make tons more in profit!&quot; So I also just did this. Patiently waiting for delivery … yeah right! Now before you all complain, I am STILL using my 12.9 IPad Pro, series 1, NL2J2LL/A - A1653. It does almost everything I need it to do, minus, Apple Health, decent video editing, and a few apps out there that do LiDAR scanning and 3D modeling. Some areas I would like to get into. When I bought this one, I also though it was insane to spend $2000 on a tablet, but that tablet has lasted me 9 YEARS. So that is $222 a year over that time. Well worth the specs and performance is has. So the $3600 for this new one, expect to get the same out of it, is $400 a year. It also has done so much, and has been so flexible, I cannot list all the apps that have been used on here to perform some simple basic task. Yeah a MacBook could probably do the same, but I cannot press a block on the screen to get it to work, I have to have a keyboard or mouse with it, and when desk space is tight, and in most of my cases nonexistent, it was great to just interface with the screen and done. I think Apple is very close to “correcting” iPadOS and actually allow Mac OS apps to just work on it, when that happens, I think all those MacBook users screaming about the cost, will be screaming for the iPad Pro. If you decide to give the tablet away, I could really use one for my business ventures. Amazing channel. Keep up the great videos. You can find a lot of other good tech products for significantly cheaper. Best of luck to ya Is actually anybody here using stage manager? If you think today is the day. Youre wrong. Apple will only do this when they feel  you are over ready. My 3080 and i7 cost 1800 quid, what the goofy is the purpose of buying such an iPad I absolutely hate the fact that all websites are becoming more and more smartphone/app-like.<br><br>I have a computer and a BFM (Big Fucking Monitor) for a reason; I am capable of having a lot of information on there and processing it.<br>The app-ification of it all just completely ruins that for me, AND I&#39;M NOT GIVEN A CHOICE ABOUT IT, it just happens, and <b>THAT</b> is what is most definitely pissing me off most about that; I&#39;ve chosen a PC for a reason, give me websites and services that fit a PC.<br><br>Fuck apps and the appification of everything digital! I don&#39;t care. The thin form factor, all of it. I&#39;m sticking with my 4th gen for the foreseeable future. I heard rumors that we were finally getting a 16-17 inch size but alas, NO...HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Why, why, why does Apple NOT listen to their customers big wants????????! Just like Samsung not listening to the millions who have been asking for an on board s-pen on the Galaxy Fold. Years of NOT listening to us. Especially the digital artist community. These companies kinda suck in the listening to their buyers realm and it&#39;s getting very old. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL 3600 BAWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. You are an iPad guy my dude. Nope, not there yet. i will not buy until the vesels are not thin and also the camera on the front must have also camera on the side You make a shitload of money from youtube, why should you care spending 3600$...u make 10 times more with this video alone. rare footage of arun not recording in his bedroom Wtf? Spending 2.8k on a tablet? You have to be RICH to even consider that. dont know if its just me but i felt last 2 videos are very boring guys, i can either buy an ipad or a car.....<br>(i already have a car lol but still, 3600 dollars can get me a decent used car) The old pencil did have a button, didn&#39;t it? You&#39;re living in a dream. They&#39;re crippling the iPad intentionally so you don&#39;t just buy it only. So it is not a smart buy That was so lame Sorry, iPad Pro with M4 chip is a total waste of resources - especially given the horrendous cost of purchasing one. I have an iPad Pro and the ONLY thing I use it for is email, Apple News, and the net. Would I consider using it for productivity apps - absolutely. But there AREN&#39;T any worthwhile productivity apps for it. I&#39;m talking in a professional situation. Yeah, you can use it to take notes, paint, et. al. but that&#39;s a far cry from a useful productivity environment. I&#39;m in the process of dumping the iPad for a Surface Pro - because I don&#39;t have a bunch of money lying around to throw at another product that I&#39;ll only use to read Apple News, email, and surf the web.<br><br>Unless and until Apple ports Mac OS to the iPad, I would NEVER consider purchasing another iPad. Actually, even if Apple DID port Mac OS to the iPad I wouldn&#39;t purchase it. Why, because in their self aggrandizing perspective, Apple has a ludicrous habit of making apps that are useful on the Mac no longer compatible with their computers/OS. I run the entire Adobe CS6 suite, which is no longer supported in Mac OS. On the other hand, the entire CS6 Suite does run on Windows. So how is it that Microsoft can make an OS that still runs these apps while Apple doesn&#39;t? Another glaring example is TurboTax. TurboTax runs flawlessly on my Win PC with no issues while I must &quot;upgrade&quot; my Mac OS to run the current version of TurboTax (I&#39;m running High Sierra on my Mac Pro and MacBook Pro, both of which run the CS6 Suite).<br><br>The WORST thing Apple ever did was to go to an annual OS update &quot;scheme&quot;, which was simply a scheme to force Mac owners to continually update their software solely to the benefit of the software developers. (I also had a &quot;new&quot; 2019 Mac Pro, which I was fortunate enough to unload since it would not run any of my Adobe software.)<br><br>People continually bash Microsoft about Windows, yet how many Mac owners run Boot Camp or Parallels to run Windows apps on their Macs because there aren&#39;t native Mac apps for their needs? i’m getting it just for the OLED…..😅 This is just a glorified ad for the newest apple gadgets. These famous channels have been on these trends recently. ur the reason why i can now stand infront of my whole class and do a speech ❤😭🤞 Omg… can get a high spec gaming pc/laptop for that price🤯😅 Fastest and most technologically advanced device to watch Netflix and YT vanilla... Not even revamced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=673\">11:13</a> has this guy ever used a mouse? Trackpads suck big time for any work. The apple trackpads are better than others, but they are still, well... trackpads. There is a reason almost no one buys a trackpad for a desktop and almost everyone with a laptop has a mouse connected to it. He may have gotten used to using trackpad, i also feel the same cause now when i try using mouse it feels way more sensitive except gaming As a coder I use trackpad but anything remotely close to editing always use mouse G102 You lost me at Samsung This is a new note 7😅 boom boom You are crazy dude.... I though the same about the ipad m1 and spanking new keyoard... useless:) Ipad is a waste of money unless you are an artist.. Its a thumb-trap...lol.. You will run back to your mac after 1 day🤣 When I watched Marqueses  video on the iPad pro, he said that the nano texture glass kind of makes the contrast worse. This is not an IPad for the average person.  It&#39;s crazy stupid expensive.  If you are filthy rich then you don&#39;t worry about the cost.  I am not. It&#39;s not that apple uses a laptop processor for an tablet, it is more like they are using a mobile processor for their laptops. Any remotely demanding application that is not hardware accelerated will kill each of these devices. They are made for a specific niche, primarily for musicians, photo editors, and video editors. Thats why you have a very fast video encoder in the M SOCs, since this will help with rendering videos, CPU based rendering would take ages on an M chip.<br>All current Apple devices are useless for any usecase that needs raw power and doesnt use hardware acceleration (like neural engine or the video engine). <br>3D modelling is a pain in the ass, as well as compiling applications from source. CAD is completely impossible in a professional work environment due to lack of software like Solidworks or Target3001.<br>Yeah AutoCAD got ported to macOS after many years, but Solidworks is still the industry standard for a lot of branches. <br>Overall GPU Performance is a complete joke on the current lineup, especially on the devices that are sold for desktop use (iMac, Mac Mini, Mac Pro).<br>Also compatibility is a BIG issue on macOS and iOS... You just do paperwork, browsing the web and composing emails? sucks to be you, buy a new device after 7 years or say goodbye to your internet connection, because new CAs dont get implemented on old versions and therefore websites that use HTST are not accessible. There is so much wrong with the apple ecosystem that the benifits are rarely worth the restrictions you have. The iPad really needs to run osX if you&#39;re going to stick a keyboard and trackpad on it. This guy is going to use it just for safari and notes. It is not a full on computer. the problem is the software. Affinity Designer work only with the iPad monitor. The secondary monitor is not supported for all apps. We need MacOS version for iPad... 3 days ago I was wondering if i should get an iPad for my pc now I think I might If it had normal operating system, then it would be usefull, but it is still only tablet, with mobile apps. Waste of money. This is just silly! Apple should just make a laptop that has a touchscreen and kill the iPads already. Why don’t we have a MacBook with touchscreen in 2024? Why? Smh hey bro nice video keep up the ggod work\\\\ You&#39;re basically realizing the benefits of the Surface Pro line over a decade later, but still facing compromises on the functionality, thanks to iPadOS. Every use case you described is literally how I&#39;ve been using the Surface Pro since 2013, and currently using a 1TB SSD 512GB MicroSD 32GB RAM i7 Surface Pro 7+ in conjunction with 43 Apps from the Play Store. It truly is a handy 4-in-1 (Tablet + Digitizer Drawing Board + Laptop + Desktop) experience and I can never settle for any mono Laptop again. That said, I must also mention I do face some reliability issues due to microsoft quality these days, but the overall uses far outweigh the issues.<br><br>Once Apple makes the iPadOS as feature-rich as macOS, then we&#39;re talking. That&#39;ll definitely be an all around better experience with 0 compromises, and likely far greater reliability than what microsoft has ever come up with. That&#39;ll be the first Mac/iPad worth my consideration... Sorry, I almost fell asleep.  No thanks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=625\">10:25</a> This one is a weird one because the Docs browser extension actually does advertise an offline mode, but I have never gotten it to work consistently in the past 10 years. I like Zoho Notebooks way better as of late tho can you plz watch out  bengoo g9000 gaming headset Apple making the price of the 2024 ipad pro like it is made with diamond or 24k gold or something seriously cmon what with the prices lately i get it that the chipsets manufacturing costs and all but damn over 2000 bucks for an ipad jeese lewis anyways arun i think its may be good decision to switch to ipad from a mac but i think it would be a little bit challenging to use but who knows you may like it This clearly is Apple sponsored. Because you needed to make a YouTube video about it. The correct answer Apple has completely lost it&#39;s way charging way to much of a premium for technology thta nobody needs. They are touting the use of final cut with the M4 , they will throttle the hell out of that ipad so that it won&#39;t melt or give somebody 3rd degree burns. Their Ipad sales will be low just like Vision Pro and they will use financial engineering to keep the stock up. There is nothing cool about Apple anymore. I think the Vision Pro has potential but they should have released a &quot;must have&quot; app at the same time. People forget that Microsoft released an advanced headset years ago and it ended up being used by engineering and scientific professionals Waiting for jerry rig everything to rip apart 😅 &quot;3600$, I mean that&#39;s an obscene amount to pay for a tablet! But I&quot; make at least 36k$ per video so who cares. apple close system sucks and pay that much for the apple hell no apple sucks in every way exept cameras to expensive to fix if it stops working or display brakes to hard and to expensive to fix and all must go through apple closed system just Over Prized Junk Expensive Trash Apple is trash  ... ok, so what is next M5, M6, M100, I do not understand If Apple were just to release MacOS for the iPad, this would be an actually good machine, despite the price.  With WWDC soon the rumors state that a new iPadOS is in the works…. But honestly it isn’t enough. MacOS needed. Fully windowed and professional OS. Since 2019 my ENTIRE YouTube channel videos have been editing exclusively on iPad. Not even my Mac with LumaFusion. <br>And now with multicam on Final Cut for iPad and Divinci resolve. A YouTuber can shoot and edit on iPhone/iPad and be a full studio. Love my m1 iPad Pro. My most used device more than my phone!! <br>Can’t wait to try out LumaFusion on M4<br><br>“think different” indeed. Waiting for jerry right now everything $3600 - ha ha .. no Hey @Mrwhosetheboss, what sweater are you wearing in your video??  It looks so comfortable Awesome videos sorry I’m sooo late It was daytime when Arun was deciding to buy the iPad then nightime at the end. Tough decisions 😅 Ipad could replace laptop?… abhi tak ka sabse chutiya device laga mujhe… i m a pro m2 user… and have a mac tooo… but ipad is shit… until it gets mac os… If Apple wants people to buy the new Ipad = they won&#39;t need to do anything!<br>Aaron did it for them already.<br>Sheep Mind Quality All The Time 👌 another good apple ad from this channel I don’t think that’s a laptop or pc replacement you still don’t have access to steam or any computer programs like actual drawing studios or computer games but ether way pretty cool just not worth the price:) It&#39;s just a tablet after all. No MacOS so it&#39;s just a glorified 13inch phone. How long until this $3,600 USD slab of glass is obsolete? I’m watching on ipad you bought it because you run a tech review channel omgad bmw m4 Jerry rigs everything will have a field day with it M4 chip to play angry birds and watch paw patrol you shouldn&#39;t drink so much Kool-Aid. dude... that a price for very good PC on windows ! um did Apple Pay you? lmao saying you&#39;d replace your laptop with an iPad is wild. Congolese children must be very happy about this information I&#39;ll stick to my galaxy tab s9 that i got for a steal/deal at $360 ... Does all i need.  Last apple product i bought was the ipad mini, damn thing won&#39;t turn on anymore, ipod touch stopped charging... and don&#39;t get me into apples refusal to allow sd cards, and its forced obsolescence damn, the price make me think that i need to get a job, but the companies in my country have many stpd requirements😤😤, such as max age😑, and you must have experience atleat for 3 years. How the fc can i get a job? <br><br><br>Owhh sorry, i am just sharing my problem to reduce my stress. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=318\">5:18</a> that&#39;s so apple Where did u get this shirt from? looks amazing I love how apple doesnt provide these influencer with free products, haha they  have to buy iPhones and iPads with their own money🤣🤣 Day 4 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. you poor? just me or did he just flex that our boy is getting married soon* i like in Aurn he&#39;s courage to express his personal opinion  regardless what the crowd think or want him to say. 👏 Courage?  Bro this is a tech channel.  If he ran into a burning building to save an old lady, thats courage iPad kids 💀💀💀 I believe there is only 1 camera at the back of the newly about to release m4 ipad pro. Tell me I&#39;m wrong. When you make videos of new products of Apple or Samsung it sounds like words of a fanboy. What is the name off the editing app BECAUSE YOUR NOT VERY SMART?   ALL APPLE PRODUCTS ARE A RIPOFF.  ONLY POPULAR  BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND THE THING TO HAVE.  LIKE EXPENSIVE SHOES THAT U CANT AFFORD &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4&quot;<br>- for content I am a huge fan of iPads since day one. But let me tell you, after one and a half years without a PC or Mac I also bought a Macbook again and that was a big relief. Why? As mentioned in the video, I can confirm that the file system is a mess, especially when you work with cloud storage. I lost so many files while editing PDFs. Btw PDFs crash regularly when I leave notes on them. Lastly, multi-tasking still doesn&#39;t work well, nit even with stage manager. When putting another window in the front, some apps stop refreshing and just forget the last edits you made - even something like word (and the app does not give you all the tools you have on a real computer). All of these problems don&#39;t have anything to do with hardware, these are all software limitations. And they will probably stay. So no, you probably won&#39;t replace your laptop with an iPad, unfortunately. I still hope for iPadOS 18, but this will be another disappointment, I guess. AVP 👽 <br>Right / and ... like that ,/ they won&#39;t ever come through /./ We.../ Nevermind / but they lost ... twice / so throw a tantrum , cause the other kid won something ,/ @Mrwhosetheboss I use the lowest spec iPad air 4 and managing files using the file manager isn’t half bad. I use an external SSD since it doesn’t have enough storage. I have to turn off the iPad every time I want to disconnect the SSD so that no files get corrupted since there is no safely remove option, that’s the only problem I have. The fact that it isn&#39;t that what will bring Apple the most money. It&#39;s them producing for the first time a 12&#39;9 ipad air. And it won&#39;t surpass the 900$ . So if you&#39;re not an editor,architect,designer or artist you now can get this huge screen with an M2 chip too for a good price comparing to the ipad Pro Software hasn’t changed.<br>You can’t put the M4 to maximum use so that’s already overpowered .<br>So on what point have you made the decision now and not 2-3 years ago when m1 iPad came out? Just being lighter and having a slightly better Apple Pencil doesn’t justify you paying almost £3k. I am watching in ipad I&#39;d buy it only to play pubg A disadvantage you may ask? It does not have a calculator app :( He probably already has division bro I mean that’s basically what is mine is a Mac without macOS There are many videos on YouTube showing people experimenting with using iPads as their only computers. I wonder why everyone goes back to their laptops or desktops. I also tried using iPad as my only computer but gave up after not being able to log into my school&#39;s online class. Editing a long paper in MS Word on iPad is also extremely uncomfortable. iPad is still a &quot;nice to have&quot; piece of tech. i rather fund my wedding for that amount. lol Fully leveraging an iPad Pro M4 in some hyper-productive fantasy is the equivalent of buying a GoPro because you fantasized about wearing a squirrel suit and flying through a canyon in the Alps. Ain&#39;t happening. &quot;They&#39;ve had a pretty big redesign&quot;<br><br>- Looks almost exactly the same as it did 6 years ago. I have an M1 MacBook Pro, with an M1 iPad Pro, and I use both for work and the reason I have both is the ability to use my iPad as a second screen. It has become such a useful feature for me if I am not at home where I have a full desk/twin monitors setup, being able to travel with my MacBook &amp; iPad means I can be just as productive anywhere I am. I could not do this before with my MacBook only because I always need a second screen for the type of work I do. iPad&#39;s are not essential in any sense, but they are an amazing tool and definitely the best tablet money can buy. Same. I love having that second screen on the go. Can you gift a cheapest ipad air? I have a dream to illustrate there through procreate 🥹 Oh dear -- I predict a maximum of one month until you post the video on how working with the iPad is so restrictive that you&#39;re moving back to the MacBook Pro. Unless the next version of iPadOS brings some unlikely major changes. So you are not the first one to have it! <br>How will we know you really ordered it?If not, smart move. I learned something😎 Im using a 32gb space phone while someone is using a 8tb device,,,,,,,being poor surely has its limitations That Remarkable without subscription plan is every college student&#39;s dream gadget😂 AND? Is it the oled will burn in? Basically, an IPad Pro is a less useful MacBook Pro with a touchscreen How does the new keyboard feel? I have the older version and I don’t like it… it makes my iPad feel like a half baked Mac… Apple is a publicly traded company that answers to their shareholders. They&#39;re not stupid to allow iPads running MacOS to cannibalize their Macbook sales.<br><br>They make more money selling two different devices that have 2 completely different target audiences instead of selling 1 device that can do it all. Great sweater. What is the brand? We need a white guy that does reviews Having an App Store makes the software you can run so boring. The extra steps in getting software out there means that most of the programs are sterile, serious and have &#39;business models&#39;. Yuck. There is a place for that, but I want computing to keep its casual, fun side. ie. an open source thing a few people hack at, or a game made over a weekend in a game jam.  I feel like maybe an iPad can be a laptop replacement for someone who is sick of computers, or scared of them. 3600usd on cocomelon accessories! hahahaha as a Samsung user I still just laugh at Apple users! This video and the comment section just prove how much yall drink the kool-aid from apple lol No tablet is worth 3600 dollars. There was ABSOLUTELY nothing in this video that justified the price tag of this tablet. The best part about it too was you can only pair the tablet with apples own design of the magic keyboard for 350 dollars haha 😂 I have the 6th. Generation of ipad pros and honestly the biggest perk is goodnotes, which lets you handwrite on the screen. But i am dissapointet that there are some apps like Microsoft 365 that dont have all the functions, though my tablet has the processing power to do them Battery is what you forget to talk about but it is something important So that you can make a vid about it, thats it. Theres nobody on earth who needs this device. Useless Bro really made this video just to make back the money for buying this ipad LOL, 2.6M views \\\\ 1000 * ~5 = $13000 made after cuts for this video. Smart. a bai engineer tu eniya chijan ch nuks kad-da en, ik wireless headphone hi bna ke dikha ta je ena hi mahar aen Because you are rich and it&#39;s nothing for you. The day I might get my Photoshop, Capture One and all the plugins for this on an iPad, I might switch- completely.<br> I have an iPad pro M2 12,9-but there is no way this could substitute my 16&quot; Macbook Pro M1Max with 64GB and 4TB.<br>And as you say- if you even have an iPhone additionally to that, the new M4 is nice, but not a must have. (BTW I use the iPad as a second screen to my MBP16-perfect match.)

Huge waste of money You didn&#39;t buy it.. I dont know if youll read my message but i would love to get a new decent phone, i wonder if you could help me with that, knowing i have no income. Can you hook up external monitors to it? Just wait JerryRigEverything durability test😂 mm because....you are a fan boy You spent $3600 on the new iPad 😳 Apple’s hoping everyone else does too 😂😬 Arun: &quot;squeeze it to bring out the menu&quot;... Samsung: s-pen does that since galaxy note 2!!! <br><br>As always, great content to be up to date on tech news! keep going forward Arun! This is y I would never buy another apple product again 😂😂😂😂 I’m watching this video on a iPad pro D1 glazer Answer: because he can write it off as a business expense for clicks and will sell it later or probably return it within two weeks.<br><br>I don’t care how great the hardware is. iPad OS is a trash operating system for that hardware some guy: i just spent $3500 on a phone strapped to my face<br>some other guy: oh cool i just spent $3600 on a tablet I am not planing to sell a kidney. I should stop watching any Apple advertisement. I tried to rewatch the use cases part several times but I&#39;m still quite fuzzy on that :-D Sounds like a nice shiny thing that people try to convince themselves that they somehow need and can use.<br><br>Realistically, this could only work as a most overpriced and overpowered remote desktop to a workstation. Can&#39;t wait for the new JerryRigEverything video tonight💀💀💀 Mrwhosetheboss, bless me with one of your older phones?🙏🏾 As an iPad Pro M2user, trust me you will always need your laptop. a lot of like simple functionality still isn’t there especially on the browser and most apps. It’s only a laptop replacement in theory, but the software is just basically ios Funny guy. Paid Advertisement. Where is your &quot;Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra&quot; Review by the way????? Care to explain why y&#39;all are selective content creator? I’m going through a real rough time with Panic Attacks ATM, re-watching all your videos is really helping me. Much Love Arun! Cause I’m a successful YouTuber and can afford acts of lunacy😂😂 no, weight wont be cut by 5x times for sure when adding the keyboard This conclusion is quite premature. Until the operating system is fully optimized, real desktop browsing is enabled, complete versions of desktop applications, and the file system is improved, this will not be considered a replacement for a laptop. Do not buy this device, shame on you Mrwhosetheboss.. Still no calculator? The best machine for Minecraft and fortnight Apple is so good at marketing that even the &quot;reviewers&quot; are hypnotised by their nonsensical products. <br><br>You are better off with your current workflow and gadgets. Spending 3-4k USD on a completely new setup when you actually don&#39;t NEED it is just insane. Remarkable 2 very expensive pen and paper replacement, just write on your paper notebook and scan it with your phone. I just saw the s 24 ultra in this video even in apple event place ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=520\">8:40</a> ) Loved the gradually changing day time from the window <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=346\">5:46</a> anyone knows the song playing in background ? for me tablets are no sense for that price, at this point you can directly buy a foldable phone and get almost everything you get from a tablet. If you have to make a heavy operation you can use your laptop with a graphics card that can demolish tablets and macbooks without a grapics card. For me, weight and small dimensions (phones pros) are better than the tablets pros, like a bigger and better screen, bigger battery or slightly better performance than phones. At this price, foldables are more worthy if you can afford it. Greate tool for professional graphists, absolutely not for me. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">00:43</a> bro nah who tf brushes like that Nice one, Subscribed.

XD Huawei tablet matepad 11.5 has magnetic attached keyboard and its quick too what you forgot to mention was that double oled screen has been around for sometime That guy in remixes kills me Isnt the top end Ipad with all the accessories more expensive than a Macbook ? I’ll bet you anything JerryRigAnything is gonna have the time of his life next week. As an artist and a writer I love iPads Pro. I didn&#39;t update mine for the last 6 years but I&#39;m really interested in the 2024 generation. I heard that this generation is something &quot;in-between&quot;: right before announcing some new Apple breakthroughs but still a huge power update. What do you think about it? I love how Arun never gives us up. Only dislike cause all we see if talking. Get the tablet then make a video. all this fuss is just for apple lovers. i mean, how many Apple products can one get, given that they can all do the same thing? that is a bit redundant... Excellent video‼Just some friendly advice : Please try to make 1 video every 4 days instead of 2 quick videos in 2 days, then we don&#39;t have to wait a week or 2 for the next video.😉🌠Oh yeah... by the way $3600 FOR A IPAD IS RIDICULOUS!!!! I would rather want a cheaper laptop. &quot;Taking the Pencil experience to a whole new level&quot; is classic Apple. Just added 2 boring gestures u already get in Samsung but for free @@Noname12........641 bro went straight <br><br>to the point! Samsung is better and costs thousands less, and it has an SD Card iPad Pro is really now for professionals, no need to buy the pro anymore I&#39;m a Apple 🍏 user😊 itne me toh 5 shadiyan ho jaani😂 Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4; because I have 18.6M subscribers. Problem solved. Great Video ❤Thank you so much !!!!!

Samsung gang vvv The new pencil pro is definitely gonna be good, I have lost 2 apple pencils in the past 3 years and my mom said she isnt buying me one anymore, but now after watching this video and learning about it I think it is definitely worth it and 2 months ago, my mom promised me to buy a new 2024 IPad and apple pencil! This makes sure im not gonna lose it, thanks Mr. Whosetheboss Because you have too much money and don&#39;t know what to do with that money, the dentist! It&#39;s like the best display, the best home theater , everything is best, except the price<br>man I just realised I could do a full home theater setup in that money. as the new iPad was released my iPad started bootlooping 💀💀 Watching from my ipad 9th gen 😊 only an idit gives money to Apple - bye Your phone doesn’t even have spellcheck How about Adobes InDesign? It’s a must-have in my work I use both an iMac at my office and a iPad for travel/meetings/home. they sync perfectly well.  <br><br>I am guessing any cloud system  (prefer one drive) should be able to sort both your file system and storage issues. What&#39;s that table name? Could you please tell me the tablet name and price also send me the link to get it? Customer&#39;s review : am not satisfy with the product <br>Seller&#39;s reply : He&#39;s lying no mobile device is worth that much, especially when its less powerful than other devices that are cheaper. isnt this just a surface book combined with some of the samsung&#39;s stylus features, except just everything fragmented and more expensive than any of these? XD The fact that people, even Mrwhosetheboss, are considering using an iPad as a main computer is simply mind-blowing. However, I would still stick to a MacBook.<br>Some context about me before I ramble. I am an iPad-first user, meaning that I am really familiar with iPadOS. I am using my second iPad, the iPad Pro M2 11-inch. The iPad, to me is always an annoying device to use for computing. Back in the days, even browsing on the iPad is frustrating. The iPadOS experience has come a long way and it has become increasingly better. <br>About a bit more than a year ago, I got my own MacBook after using a slow family PC for years. I fell in love with macOS (disclaimer: it is macOS Ventura when I first used macOS). It almost feels like the functionality of Windows combined with the intuitive elements of iPadOS. <br>Slowly, I picked up hobbies like coding in an IDE, video editing with an NLE, and music production with a DAW. I also use productivity software like Excel. This is when I realize the limitations of iPad.<br>When Apple made the Magic Keyboard, I decided to give it a try. However, trying to make an iPad more like my mac makes it frustrating to use. I finally came into the conclusion that my iPad is only useful for 3 things.<br><br>1. To be used as a portable second screen for my MacBook<br>2. To use a stylus on it for apps like Apple Notes, Procreate, and Affinity Designer 2<br>3. To use it when a tablet make sense like in a park, at a lecture, or at a meeting<br><br>I sold my Magic Keyboard and I am never going back. I will not try to make an iPad more like the MacBook. People would hate me for saying this but I think that Apple is going in the wrong direction with the iPad. Apple currently makes lots of products and their recent iPhone 15 lineup and MacBooks are great. The AirPods are doing great, even the Apple Watch. However, even Apple themselves are confused with the iPad as a product category, putting them in this weird spot with the MacBooks.<br>I propose that they stop making the Magic Keyboard and instead add touchscreens and stylus support for all their MacBooks. Alternatively, we can even have an ordinary tablet running iPadOS and it would literally become a mac when docked on a Magic Keyboard. I’ve been using Ipad Pro 2018 for the last 5 years<br><br>I bought the Ipad for 1100$<br>Apple Pencil gen2 for 150$<br>A cheap Bluetooth Keyboard/mouse for 15$<br><br>these 1265$ made my life and my Med school years 100x easier, and I never even needed a laptop the OLED screen and the M4 are nice but i‘m not gonna upgrade my 2020 Pro BECAUSE of the thinness 👀<br>it‘s so scary my old one already bent a little just by carrying it around in a backpack for school<br>WHO asked for a thinner iPad?!? Whats better ipad pro m1 (2021) or the new ipad air m2 (2024) ?<br>Because both product have same price Some phone apps aren’t optimised for ipad os sadly, for example instagram apple overprice  not worth !!my outlook on money changed when I realized someone making $300,000 can retire broke &amp; someone making $80,000 can retire a multi-millionaire.

That&#39;s her what&#39;sapp 🇺🇲+146 9347 4074 Tell her that I referred you 🙏🙏 She&#39;s guide you definitely🇺🇲 Bel end I love watching reviews of the new products knowing that I probably won’t be able to afford them any time soon lol I would instantly change to an iPad if I could code on it Xiaomi pad 6 is also really nice tho.  I rather prefer this for 400 then go for srupid overprices apple products Hey peeps I have $3600 burning a hole in my pocket, don&#39;t you? DON&#39;T YOU?! BUY! BUY! BUY! You must try the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra I scared about bending test of zack It is Tantalizing but not $3600 worth of Tantalizing! One can get a 27&quot; Imac desktop and an ipad 10&quot; and an Apple watch for $3600! Camera holes make me remember Mercedes Benz 2008 head lights <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=508\">8:28</a> FALSE - there&#39;s much less UI/option customisability on mobile apps!!! TL/DW: Because I&#39;m rich and could afford buying all the newest and the most expensive toys. If they install MacOS on the ipad it&#39;s game over: yes.<br>Otherwise it&#39;s a game over: no. Sooo nobody’s gonna ask why was he sucking on his toothbrush like that??? I love Apple, and your Channel. But you all are missing the point when it comes to the iPad OS vs MacOS. For example you should ask your editors if they would use the new IPad to make one of your videos. Apple markets these IPads for creators, in factor their whole brand towards creators, yet they give us the power, but hold out by making subpar apps Not everyone is going to get it specked out the base model is like 100 or 200 dollars more than a iPhone 15 pro max😭😭 because you are a YouTuber, and then you will probably make 8k on the reviews. If you invest 3600$ then you can make 1 million dollars 💰 then why people buy tablet with phone features i feel the same whit capcut I guess saying you&#39;re shying away from Samsung tablets for using a mobile chip is kinda a biased opinion, what can&#39;t it do that the iPad with the macbook chip can do? Give away, please. I need it to learn Waiting for a good android tablet for gaming  lesser than m4 apple without heating issue glad i not iphone fan👍😀 For clout. This guy annoys me to death. The macbook being the bridesmaid in the wedding There is only one way to describe spending $3600 for a tablet, and it&#39;s not polite at all to mention it... The most specked out iPad in the US is $2600. That means you&#39;re paying $1000 more for yours. Geez! My iPad mini 2 is 10 years old this year. Cost £319. But it still does what most people use an iPad for - web, YouTube, Netflix. Seems disingenuous when wealthy people complain about a price of something, is it to try to relate to the audience? Is it an honest reaction? I have no idea, but I know I just watched you destroy three new iphones Something like a 6.8 inch phone that unfolds to a tablet is what i am looking for What motor bike game is that at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=63\">1:03</a> please tell me mountain bike xtreme . developer; pixel joy It’s more expensive than the apple vision pro I think the biggest benefit of the slim size is the fact that you can easily add a case + keyboard to it without it adding too much weight. I also don&#39;t think the comparisons to macbooks are valid since it&#39;s a different style of computer - it&#39;s not meant to compete with a macbook and doesn&#39;t cater to the same user group. It&#39;s the most advanced device in its category and I think Apple is trying to build the best device in the category and hoping the developers will build the apps that brings the users. 2.6M views pay for it? He&#39;s spending $3600 on it because he can. because you&#39;re rich? Apple over priced, move on They need to put the full OS on it and stop halting progress, Steve jobs did not fear cannibalising his own product line for the future, which is why we have the iPhone and not iPod. ipad is next gen game changing for students in a level/uni... That smart toothbrush was goin crazy 😅 Imagine Apple creating a dedicated Apple Gaming Controller and playing GTA 6 on the OLED 13 inch. Would that make people buy it? Fun Fact: An iPad with magic keyboard is even pricier than MacBook Air. However, MacBook Air can satisfy almost every kind of lite-PC-work, including Office, Video Editing as well as simple coding. For the iPad, it isn&#39;t stable on the laptop while typing and it is on the table of train. <br>To edit photos, MacBooks is capable enough because of its fundamental file management as well as desktop softwares.<br>Same Price but with fewer capabilities. I got an iPad with the magic keyboard in 2021 and it replaced my MacBook. It’s honestly my an all rounder: Allows me to work and take meetings on the g and I use it for watching and entertainment. I would actually skip the pencil (as my handwriting is so bad) andthe magic keyboard with the trackpad. Since the iPad is a touch screen, I don’t really use the trackback. To date, still one of my best purchases. nah logitech combo prolly coming to 2024 pro. We dumped Mac Laptops for all ipad maybe 3 years ago. Best computer decision I’ve made. I will only consider getting one unless it&#39;s not going to be bent as easily as the previous gen. more money than sense The galaxy tab s9 ultra is 0,55mm thin at 14,5&quot; - the new Apple tablet is 0,52mm thin at 13&quot; <br><br>Are those 0,02mm really that noticable?<br><br>edit: especially when you slab a case on it anyway. Is it not like marvelling at &quot;the new daring colours and textures of those amazing new phones...&quot; - and then putting them into a 20 ISK bumper case from AliExpress? The lack of a proper filing system is just a deal breaker for me. Dropbox is pretty awful on iPad too. You can’t connect to network drives in a sensible way either. Great for media consumption not so great for creating it. So simply put, will the phone eventually have enough PC level ability to make a Desktop, Laptop, Tablet devices obsolete. Work whole life n buy apple tablet that is life goal 😂 Can you gift me one Most expensive YouTube Kids and Netflix device ever I am watching this video brand new in My redmi pad SE..sounds good.... Unjustifiable cost Hopefully this is the start of them bringing the super slim 12-inch MacBook back. Don’t drop the iPad it might fly away The BIGGEST problem with IOS as a laptop replacement is its lack of ability to manage files.  If they did that… then I can migrate to an iPad Get a NAS, instead of iCloud and large devices :) why u talking in the dark does it bend? More Crap from Apple.. Cringe Nah nah nah I love this channel but be real my bro, the reason ya made a video on it is tax write off 😂😂😂 Lol snapdragon x is coming to takeover. I didn&#39;t think i would ever feel this way about mrwhosetheboss video but damn arun 🫠 this gotta be the stupidest video you ever created 😬 it&#39;s silly to compare laptop to iPad, they&#39;re very few niche use cases in which ipad could be good replacement but other than that it&#39;s big no! Samsung 14 feel is better product and beside nothing wrong with 12.9 pro Bro how did you get that Pokémon wallpaper anyone know? I still use a tablet. I use an Amazon fire and it&#39;s great! 😂 🎉 Nope. Will wait in a year or two Guess I don&#39;t need a MacBook Replaced the complete macbook fr Don&#39;t know about you but consuming your content makes me iGlad 😂 I never understand people outside of graphic designers who prefer an ipad over an actual laptop where you can use a real key board and real programs, not just apps. To get more views 😂 I trying to replace everything with an iPad since 2018. 99% of daily business tasks is no problem. I even miss some IPad features when using the MacBook for the remaining 1%. But as soon as you hit pro tasks (P.e. editing 1k+ Fotos, import, export) things take so long. I think the IPad is too fast for most usecases, but not fast enough for pro cases. For me it is not langer a OS thing, it‘s performance in pro tasks. But doesn’t ipadOS really hold back the functionality of this beast? 😱😱😱 If your intention is to do serious work, then you will regret this move. iPadOS cannot currently replace MacOS or Windows - You’ll see. Talks about how he struggles to find a need for a “tablet” and then 1 minute later says he always carries a paper-like writing tablet everywhere he goes because “sometimes you just want write things down.” LOL…so which is it then? iPad Pro with Pencil can do the same plus is way more versatile as an actual computer vs a dedicated writing tablet. Honestly an iPad Pro/Pencil/Keyboard combo is the ultimate and most versatile device for daily carry. If you can adjust to doing PC-tasks in an iPad workflow, you can probably satisfy 95% of your computing needs while on-the-go. If you really need macOS while on-the-go, then you can remote in to your Mac, but those needs are probably few and far between unless you’re trying to record a podcast while out on the town 😂😂 Ayo that toothbrush part looks sus bruv That is really the coolest Tee I have seen for long. Where did you get it? me convincing myself that i made a good purchase There was a time when apple (Steve Jobs era), used to upgrade product lines and lower the price. Or offer a more affordable product line. Aww the good ol days where apple products where affordable and useful. I’m been in Apple since Apple IIe 😂.  Now my setup two pads multiple screens with a docking station 😅 The videos are like Neverending thumbnails if Jobs was around, this would have probably been holographic All this power and capability and we can’t get a freaking calculator app Watching this on Xiaomi pad 6s pro 😂 S23 ultra guy here I have an ipad air 4 and while apple advertises new releases like its going to change my life, in most cases, rarely does. I&#39;d rather wait a year or two longer for the tech to normalise and for more people to have general use opinions Yes it looks wonderful but at those pricing levels the market is going to be thin. Remember Apple sell around the world. Outside the US and G-7 countries the existing range is a luxury and often retails for more than in the US. If Apple aren’t careful so e other manufacturer is going to come in and with a cheaper product steal their lunch. Yes leaving the Apple family is difficult but how much would a top of the range Ipad, Iphone and watch cost you? There are two kinds of people in this world:-<br>1. Uses Apple<br>2. Just watch other people use apple coz they know deep inside nothing can beat a beefy windows gig. Tbh you&#39;ve repeated the same stuff again and again here, became boring ,<br> feedback if you use it at the profesional level you noticed the shorts. The fact you said you don&#39;t edit anymore tells that any iPad will do for you. lovely screen true please, giveaway this 2024 ipad pro on your subscribers🫠 We lost arun as an Android user well done tim cook well done This video was a full ad baked with multiple ads in it…. YOU SOLD OUT! $3600 hahaha nope Mr Boss went day to night recording this video. Can buy M3 Macbook Pro medium storage Totally like you will explain to your wife why you spent $3600 for that. Right before she will kick you out. )) You are probably gonna switch back to Mac soon Smart tooth brush part was kinda sus I wish they had a pro version for iPad mini. I feel that’s still more useful than a 13 inch iPad trying to replace a laptop that will never happen. To be honest I have both MacBook and iPad and I really love my iPad when doing my school work on the go instead of my computer I just use Apple keyboard and trackpad folio and it’s all doing very good for me Good job They would still sell a lot of em. No, thanks. I&#39;m fine with Galaxy A9+ sub $200 tab. It plays YouTube and Netflix just fine. Because I’m rich biach 😂 Still can&#39;t use VsCode or programming IDEs 16 minutes of straight yapping on a product you dont even have ur hands on yet is crazy. get that bag I guess Ok ok, ill go buy one tomorrow Switching to an IPad only is condemning yourself to an endless amount of Subscription services.. since every app basically has one.. Brother,<br>What is the name of your notepad look like tab ???<br><br>Please tell the model no. $3,600 piece of paper will fold like a piece of paper. get a high-end PC. Go Go I won&#39;t tell you twice. $3600 - What a Bargain, Thamks Apple!!!  <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/2sIfY8vIG8z96ALulYDQDQ\"></a>. It&#39;s funny to think that when Apple released the first ever iphone, it only cost $200. i still prefer laptop(PC mode browser) and website<br>certain functionalities aren&#39;t available on apps, you&#39;d have to eventually open your laptop on browser PC mode to access those functionalities I bought the M1 tablet didn’t like it you can almost buy a used car with that amount The screen is so nice on the previous gen ipads. Macbook air to pro is meh, but the ipads are impressive. I dont use a tablet, but curious how this new one looks irl. I&#39;ve used my iPad instead of a MacBook for ten years. A few weeks ago, I bought a MacBook Pro. And uh yeah, don&#39;t get an iPad. He&#39;s not mentioning a massive variety of things that the iPad cannot do. Every website just works on a laptop. iPadOS can be crap for a ton of sites and apps. Trust me, it&#39;s a completely different experience. Thinking about selling my iPad at this point because idk what to do with it. The script of this video is from previous video The correct question is: how to make a content that worth $3600 for my ipad pro.. Yeap!.... Yes, but Surface has been doing this for many years ago!!! And it´s it´s doesn&#39;t run a app OS!!!! 😉😉 Other than using the pen for drawing/notetaking, I still see no use for a tablet in my life. Everything a phone can do a phone can do better, and everything a laptop can do a laptop can do better. I don&#39;t have anything I notice falling into that grey area in the middle where I wish I had a tablet. And definitely not one that costs more than a laptop. Awesome!!! I have the previous gen iPad Air that I bought in November and fell in love with the Apple Pencil. I love the fact that the new Apple Pencil isn’t compatible with the last gen iPad. Good on Apple to want the best for me forcing me to upgrade my iPad just for Find My. They’re always have my best interest in heart 🙃🙃🙃<br><br>- a loyal perpetually annoyed Apple fanboy Even is today&#39;s world where the majority of web traffic is on mobile/tablet devices... the web just still doesn&#39;t feel at all designed for it, to me. The amount of times I&#39;ll abandon a checkout on my phone to pick back up on my computer because I was frustrated and having issues is astronomical. That&#39;s what the tablet does best, better than phone and portable and almost as good as computer experience if not as good or better. I don&#39;t enjoy searching for flights km phones but do on tablet and laptop It’s because websites are built using laptops, not phones. Mobile will always be an afterthought that isn’t tested as often. Never really have an issue with websites on a mobile device, I almost never have to use my laptop… good for Aaron that Apple made a device with a price/specs which can only be justified by his needs @@jamesalexduranyeah what is OP buying? 99% of my checkouts don’t have any issues Are you using iOS? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> 😏.... 😂 The day it support MacOS is the day I consider buying it Watching on iPad 9th gen 🙂🫠 Yea I bought the iPad Air 6 and though that was expensive😅 The biggest downside of the iPad has been the lack of software. We are getting closer. But as a 3D artist, it&#39;s not there. If Zbrush is any good on the iPad later this year that would be a game changer. I mean I would still need marvelous and substance but hopefully Zbrush being on iPad encourages everyone else to hop on. and development There are a lot of touchscreen laptops or pc tabs. iPad is only thin because it&#39;s not supposed to handle those softwares. They wouldn&#39;t put pc operating system on it for a reason, it&#39;s because the thermals will never work with that form factor, that&#39;s why with same specs there is or will be a laptop too to do those things. I feel like mrwhosetheboss using AI for this video (including audio) Only an idiot will spend that much on a device that depreciates over time, has no Apple buy back option, no self repair, no more than a year of warranty, very low resale value and a high performance m4 chip that just sits there with nothing powerful to process, as you can’t run full fledged software on it. I think it really depends on what you do. Most don’t need it though. <br><br>I might pick up a maxed out one to use for editing 1080p/4k footage and pairing it with blackmagic design’s new micro colour panel. It has a groove on the back for the iPad to nest into and the screen is amazing for grading footage. Look it up. You lost 3600 dollars. 👀 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 What&#39;s with the annoying wallpaper Imagine spending 3k on a tablet just to play angry birds Looking forward to your wedding review 🤣 I&#39;m watching this on a $200 CAD tablet right now. I cant wait to waste money for 0,6 mm thickness difference Buying products from Apple is like spending a percentage of your life savings to get F&#39;d in the starfish and you don&#39;t get to choose who does it. Samsung tablets are 5.6 mm. Not that much different from 5.3 to the naked eye and 1/4 the price and also more features but slower... It&#39;s incredible what Apple did here but honestly that&#39;s still too heavy for my liking.  I end up putting down my existing tablets because it&#39;s just not comfortable enough to use long term.  Now... the technology behind it... Freaking AWESOME!  Just no thank you in the end for the price and weight. Maybe because you have money and dont care to spend 20k (and more) in Apple products? Very smart you turned into a laptop Next year T-Mobile will have these for free with a 2 year mobile plan Waste of cash!!! why you promote this crap?? still waiting to get my first apple brand 🥲 damn i&#39;ll be damned, we&#39;re approaching the PDA era I just want an iPad without cameras. I don’t care for cameras and I HATE seeing doofuses using an iPad to take photos and videos. Bik gayi hai ye sarkar. What are you going to do about iPads&#39; lack of browser plugins? whyy not buy M2 tablet? i  can do everything M4 can using M2 ipad. Doesn&#39;t chrome os cover all these bases and has a decent file system. ? &quot;I wanted to make a video on it.&quot; aka you can get that sht written off as a business expense LOL. We see you. I knew why he bought it when I saw this video has 2.5M views. He bought it because he&#39;s rich and because he&#39;ll make more money from suckers who watch this video than he spent on the product. And now, having commented, I will leave before I watch. Really Arun? 4000 for a tablet? 😢😢 What about the poor people? Because you have a youtube cahnnel The perfect tagline: &quot;The iPad Pro M4. When you have more dollars than sense.&quot; It really depends the type of person you are: someone that does coding or needs a file system, a laptop or desktop is a lot better. A gamer doesn’t want tablets or even laptops (because they basically gotta stay connected 24/7). Now for a teacher (like me) who only utilizes Google classroom and basic apps it’s so easy and more maneuverable to work on an iPad. It’s nice because as a SpecialEd iI can even walk around with an thin iPad and show the kids slides or concepts in a more hands on (touch) manner which is what some of these kids prefer and work with better. Also for an artistic person that does photo editing, video editing, or drawing/ painting an iPad is amazing! Just really depends on what your habits are tbh. I’d say like 70% of people would work better with a PC but a lot of people are casuals and don’t really use apps specific that only work on laptops - for those it’s very nice to use an iPad Just preordered a 13” pro with 1tb in space black and I am so pumped. The last time I was this stoked to get a new piece of tech I was 12 years old waiting for the Nintendo Wii. What makes you more excited about this one than previous iPad Pros? @@PressContinueToQuit that double stacked OLED, mostly. Also just very glad the front facing camera is in the right spot now so I won’t look like a dingus on zoom calls. I love the space black and the thinness is pretty neat as well. I just can’t wait to get this in my hands. I prefer using an iPad to a traditional laptop, this one just looks spectacular. Apple actually making something that isn’t the same as the last thing that they made is surprising to me 😅 Umm.. because you have money burning a hole in your pocket It&#39;s an ipad, no one buys an ipad My gaming laptop is only 1000$ this video was rather entertaining. You have gained a new subscriber.!! No one should ever spend 3600 for an oversized tablet. Please get some help if you have already done so. 🤣 Bro I thought it was $360 Just give me a M4 PRO Mac Studio and I’ll be happy My iPad Pro M1 does everything I need as a video editor/colorist, an engineering student, and an office employee.<br><br>I can video edit in DaVinci Resolve and stream using the USB-C input with a capture card.<br><br>I can run engineering software like Fusion 360, MatLab, Shapr3D, etc.<br><br>I can also run office, XMind, etc.<br><br>All this with cellular data and a detachable touchscreen. yes but you&#39;re not rich. He got the M4 and made millions Bro ngl you’re probably the first person ive ever heard of getting through engineering school with an iPad. Where you mechanical? I couldn’t imagine, i mean does it support Matlab simulink, how does it even handle any computationally demanding matlab tasks. What about arduino ide for programming or rasp pi for flashing microcontrollers? Also you can’t run ansys, any Dessault programs, Altium, any PLC or robotics software. What about 3d printing software for exporting G-code. No offense bro, engineering is for windows, I couldn’t imagine working on a senior design project using an ipad i think they are great for taking notes, making reports or reading spec sheets. But im assuming you spent a fair amount of time on the school computer because iPads literally don’t support most mechanical engineering software, and its very limited. I don’t know why you didn’t just get a basic dell with like a 3050 or something. I personally have a macbook air but also a pc, and without my pc, I would’ve literally never been able to leave the computer lab. Dude It’s kinda hard to believe you 😂 @@seriessplayer62747Engineering student here. I decided to try my luck at doing my mac workload on my ipad, just to see if it  was possible. I couldn’t even get past the microsoft login page for my student email. The literal login page wouldn’t load on my ipad. And god forbid I try to code on it, the only language this thing can run is Swift. Awful device for college if you’re trying to use it for anything beyond note taking @@seriessplayer62747 I’m biomedical engineering, so I need to be able to draw organic chemistry structures and take complex notes.<br><br>I don’t need to run Raspberry Pi IDEs, MatLab actually runs in the cloud (so that’s handled), and I can use the departmental computer for random specific tasks (like COMSOL for Fluids Modeling). It&#39;s understandable why Johny Ive has left Apple, knowing that he is its brain behind the innovation. However, now Apple has been plagued with uninspired and unsuccessful ideas. I love my previous gen iPad Pro and I am jealous of this new one and I have been an Apple fan for decades but this video comes across as a guy trying to justify dropping more than 3Gs on a goddamn tablet. 😂 Have we tried the bend test yet? At least people won&#39;t really be carrying these around in their pockets and sitting on them... I think the BEST thing about these new models is that hopefully it&#39;ll continue to reduce the price of the older versions! I&#39;m still running an iPad Air2!! And it&#39;s still perfectly fine for my use case, which essentially is just consuming web content, messaging and the occasional email. At the price, does it make any sense to buy one of these instead of a Macbook for ANY Productivity use cases? I&#39;m a dentist. What in the worldly fuck is a smart toothbrush? Thanks for keeping me entertained I hope apple make everything thinner again... Fat macbooks and iphones are a disaster! Dreaming to grabs ipad one day With $3600 I would go an buy a 4090 and ok system to put it in...  Oh, ill put 10tb of storage in there just cus.... mac doesn&#39;t give you that option.... The whole video honestly though... fr just sounded like he was trying hard to justify paying $3600 for a tablet lol. Why? So u can tell us the truth about it? An obscene price... pays it 😂. You keep buying it they will keep pushing the price people are willing to pay. You all come across as so elitist (tech YouTubers). None of you have had the grapefruits to plainly say &quot;who is this for? Who care about M4 or an oled screen at this price?&quot; Seriously, there are lay off everywhere and I understand you&#39;re not the makers of these devices. But you are purveyors of information. And it is your duty clearly tell Apple that consumers don&#39;t want this at this price. They don&#39;t. The vision pro has failed and so will this. Instead, you&#39;re all too comfortable to be smiling talking heads as long as apple gives you that sweet sweet sponsorship. Pathetic. I have may MacBook Pro M2<br>And just bought a HP Spectre and love it. Got it on sale for $899. Ultra 7 16 gb and 1 tb Hd oh!!!!  Force Touch pad also. <br><br>I switched to windows. Screw Apple. Easy to buy when you&#39;re a disgustingly overpaid YouTuber I never see people with the pros just the cheapest one from Walmart. I’m starting to think Apple only makes the most expensive products so influencers make a I paid the price of a used car for an iPad so you don’t have to video. As a photographer, editing on an iPad Pro is absolutely a pain for one simple reason: the file system. My workflow involves dumping my raw photos onto a NAS, editing them, and then saving them back to the NAS, and there&#39;s no way to do that efficiently with an iPad. Why is that? They added the ability to mount NAS shares into the Files app some versions ago, is it just that the photo apps don&#39;t work with them that way? @@CubeApril Dude&#39;s scrambling to set this up 😂 I&#39;ll buy one when they bring the MacOS to the iPad, I guess it&#39;s good for non-pro users right now Think I&#39;ll stick to my Tab S9 FE which cost me about 85% less than this 😂 wow apple must be paying a lot. never though he&#39;d be a sellout too. sad day. Bruh, stop rickrolling us . I see the background. Tried to replace my mac with the iPad... it just isn&#39;t there yet. You constantly are hit with things that you have to figure out how to do that just work on the Mac. Best of luck though, maybe the new iPad will be different. he talks about this like ipads never existed before... more performance for what? watching netflix? cmon dude &quot;I&#39;m gonna bring my M4 to school&quot; 💀 So, first it was all about touch screens, now it is about not having to touch the screens 🙃 You should check out the HMD phones! new ipad means the previous one will have a good discount soon Sweater brand? Can i shoot with my M4 iPad? I love and use my iPad Pro 2018 every day, but I won’t pay that kind of money for one. Get ready to use one app at a time forever when using this $3,600 iPad. I carry my laptop all the time since I spent big $ on an iPad so I could leave my laptop home. iPadOS still is sure we have no use for a Finder, so there’s that. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. It quacks like a notebook. As a Macbook (&quot;Late 2011&quot;, still rocking for music production!) Fanboy, former iPad and iPhone User I gotta say, I feel your sentiment. Very much. Apple do make really top-nodge hard- and Software. The boomer for me on iOS Devices is, the lock-in factor, and the closed ecosystem. Beeing stuck on devices w/o File-System, forcing me  to use  apps for file-transaction, makes you end up using slow &quot;over the air&quot; syncing to achieve distribution of your files on multiple devices, or hardware back-ups.<br>Although, I gotta say, the Sync between an iPhone and a MacBook is waayyy more convenient and functioning, than any android file transfer. (Do you have an app recommandation which remembers which files were synced like iPhotos / Photos app does for Android?)<br>Still, iPhone feels kinda &quot;limited&quot; to me, as it  has limited options for basic functionality still (did they re-invented the battery percentage icon + number duo yet? :D)<br>And owning an iPad for sure will remind you  often about &quot;why not use an iPhone as convenient addition?&quot;.<br>Each to his own, and if you can afford the apple family, why not give it a try. My Samsung galaxy S21 Ultra still makes me smile every day with its superbe performance and functionality, so, cheers, and excited to hear your future findings. B) Ha!  I use Remarkable 2 as well.  It&#39;s a great way to escape and just ... focus on stuff. The price of this makes the humane pin price seem reasonable 😂😂 The worst wallpaper design of all time lol It’s not a full computer Just got the S9+ (516 Gb) and i already have around 50Gb... 😂So I understand the 8tb concern Give me a break; you also have 18 million subscribers to pay for your iPad. The rest of us will say &quot;$3000 for a tablet, are you fucking crazy???&quot; That&#39;s the normal reaction <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=54\">0:54</a> Android 3, my favorite💖<br>I remember my old Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1″, it was such a cool tablet. It had 16GB of memory and could run GTA SA at a low but playable frame rate. Still it is an IOS and not a MacOS. ...because you have too much money? cool background really? you spend $3,600? Another gimmick, aren&#39;t you get tired of this? Only bought a base iPad for ,y girlfriend because she just wanted it for TikTok lol OMG the good excuses for this pad is crazy. Let&#39;s be real it&#39;s still can&#39;t do what laptops do. To expensive for what it does.   But seems like because it&#39;s Apple The criticisms are minor. Please Review moto edge 50 pro The review made it sound pretty damn good.  Still not buying one though.<br>Apple sux 😁 The file system might become a nightmare. I hate files and folders in ipad. Would kill me with all the files i need This guy is becoming the Apple shill day by day. iGlad am Still watching this on my 2018 iPad Pro, and it works great (until they decide to not support it anymore) This sounds like all the perks of a surface tablet. I use the iPad Pro for shapr3d, it’s why I bought an iPad Pro (13inch) still the screen is too small and cluttered. Wondering about the Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Fold (16.3inch). Why did you have to suck on that tooth brush like that?? lol It’s $2,600 for a fulled loaded iPad Pro with 13” screen , 2TB, nano glass, &amp; cellular.  Who ripped him off?!?!? intersting new set 👌👌 nononono... when a product tells me I have to install an app, rather than use a website, I don&#39;t use that company. Half of these apps only exist to track you and sell your data to advertisers.<br><br>I shouldn&#39;t have to bloat my phone out with a million stupid apps to buy a t-shirt or look at a menu, or read an article. Stop making me sign up for stuff and install stuff. Just give me a website.<br><br>Websites work on every device, and if you need an account, you can use your account on every device you have. Apps are a pain in the butt. Took them a M4 chip to enable short cut function let&#39;s lmao Wanna be Surface/ 2-1s cuz they effed up This is the same thing with the apple vision pro when everyone thought that it would replace phones😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀 Video should be titled how apple always steal my money😂 just get a high end pc/laptop with a drawing pad... why you bought this. the simple answer is you are so rich, man. M4 is unnecessary and would help Apple to pick up sale. And it is a tax write off All they had to do was just make a removable MacBook screen that was touch screen How to waste ur money: I hate Apple 🍎 I can&#39;t stand being stuck having to buy accessories in the same environment 😒 unlike Android that is simple you can mix match brands and there isn&#39;t a problem with connectivity it just works This SCREAMS paid AD! <br>I can&#39;t trust nothing he says as his own genuine views! 11inch pro for fun and Mac Pro for work <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=972\">16:12</a> He’s not married yet and his dad jokes are already starting to show up. Just letting Arun know I would&#39;ve clicked on this video even before he changed the title to &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4&quot; To make this video and earn from it. Looks like Apple don&#39;t want you to build a iPhone now they have 19mil subs....I honestly believe you only said it for subs and we will never see the build now your on 18mil subs Finally you can have iphone, Macbook and iPad all in one device, add a pencil and Googlesung is in trouble. My $800 2020 iPad Pro has literally become a glorified YouTube watching device after the first week I got it. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=20\">0:20</a> you can convert it to INR too otw your views ‘ll. Yeah it looks like there&#39;s absolutely no sense in purchasing anything that is... It&#39;s just overprise just cause they could do it.... Absolute trash.. ‘Like’ He justified iOS without even talking about the Multitasking and notification mess. What a dumbo What a waste of money... So frosted glass costs $2000k? I can buy semi transparent matte for next to nothing. Apple is really going nuts, literally. Sorry. but tablets will always be nothing more than huge phones to me. I’ve been using my M1 iPad Pro for 2yrs now… it’s actually my main device now… I’ve got an M1 MacBook Pro, which I hardly use… I just wish apple gives us Pro style apps with the exact same functionality as found on MacOS… not skimming. I can live with ipadOS… just give me a full version of Logic Pro on my iPad. nothing here other than incremental improvements. are you going to spend another $3600 when the next tablet is lighter, thinner, and faster? as for laptop vs tablet; you clearly don&#39;t need the functionality of a laptop but this doesn&#39;t mean an ipad is better. All i hear is &quot; we took everything samsung has been doing and decided to do it ourselves finally&quot; I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one who would say that their parents don&#39;t want them watching youtubers who cuss Apple don&#39;t care. They know there&#39;s a queue of idiots willing to spend that kind of money on a pad. Let the fools spend.... Welcome to the Apple storage game. They can just as easily provide an sdxc slot but wont. They can kiss my bass. This is hardly the first YouTuber saying an iPad can replace a laptop. Ever since the M1 iPad, or maybe even earlier, YouTubers have been saying that the iPad Pro is just as powerful if not more powerful than some laptop computers. But guess what, It been almost 4 years since the release of the M1 iPad, and still the same old song. The problem was never about the hardware, you can put supercomputer chip inside, as long as it still runs iPadOS, its still nothing more than a toy for most people. &quot;apple&#39;s thinnest product&quot;<br>polishing cloth left the chat Everyone in med school uses tablets That iglad made me chuckle 😂 that toothbrush shot tho lol susss Youre not tricking any of us to buy that garbage cuhh🗣️🗣️ As an iPad Pro user, the Galaxy Tab Ultra feels more advanced design wise bc it already has an OLED screen, thin body, but also has much slimmer bezels DONT DO THE NANO COATING! THE BLACKS ARE NOT AS DEEP AND YOU LOOSE SHARPNESS! ALSO VERY HARD TO TAKE CARE OF! The answer to why is because you&#39;re a millionaire and can. Productivity apps unfortunately really suck on iPad. Notion’s app, for example, is abysmal. I get everything I need out of my s9 FE. I couldn&#39;t imagine spending that kind of money on a tablet, regardless of the performance upgrade. Next thing you know, you&#39;ll see some random 5-10 yr old decked out with an iPhone 50 pro max, air pods, and the new iPad, I guess. Replacing a laptop (in this case MacBook) for a tablet (in this case iPad) ... yeaaahh... no. benchmarks got leaked And 99% of people watching this cannot drop £3k on a tablet. or take one samsung galaxy 4 book 360  and samsung galaxy s14 ultra i like my ipad 9th gen. does what i need it to! Fellas, is it apple’s fault that you use it only to watch Netflix and YouTube ? Specifically when you could’ve got the cheaper 400$ one ? Dog I JUST BOUGHT the M2 a year ago when it was the hottest shit and they’re at M4 now? Lmao get out What is the writing tablet he’s comparing it to? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=199\">3:19</a> Remarkable 2 thoughts:<br>Yes its thin but whit a case its not, nobody use this without protection<br><br>With the magic keybord you cant use it as an ipad anymore I was somewhat underwhelmed by the iPad reveal meanwhile you spend $3600 on it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">00:43</a> ... 🤨🤨🤨 You are right, they are not just big phones, they are a BIGGER phone So what can it do that my iPad 5th gen can&#39;t? I use my iPad a lot for daily work but it&#39;s really old now, I don&#39;t want to drop $3600 on a new one Tablet = Smart Plate M1 MAX still good for my iPad🗿 Never buy Apple.. stop being a sheep. Because youre an apple fan boy.... Considering using a tablet as a laptop is just stupid!... even more with the actual iPad OS system... what a wanker! 8 fucking terabytes?!? bro, get off Torrent sites lol Im guessing the answer is &quot;Because I can make a video on it, write it off on my taxes as a business expense, amd monetize the video.&quot; it 100% wont replace your macbook Couldn’t agree with you more I’ve been using my 10.5 inch iPad Pro for 7 years every day all day cost $729 still runs excellent still can get the latest updates in software. Never had an issue with any problem one button touch and it’s on. <br><br>Ordered the 11 inch iPad Pro because Apple is giving me $100 trade-in plus I get another 10% education discount so the new ones only costing $800. Although my iPad Pro still works great and battery is still good figured it’s about time to give it a rest and take advantage of $100 trade-in. <br><br>I also purchased the logic tech keyboard case combo from Apple because that’s the only place you can get it right now for $229 just delivered today really nice case. light up keyboard, function keys, and a huge trackpad, but weighs practically nothing and you can just pull it apart from the magnet if you don’t need a keyboard. Had a similar case for my old iPad and it still works great never had an issue. Protected my iPad from a few drops. All these screens devices just do the samethings at this point. This is might just be an unpopular opinion, but with inflation and everything that is going on; I don’t think $3000 is a good price for a tablet that still runs on an iPad OS worth it. Especially when Apple keeps coming out with all these different processors and it barely touches what can be done on the current OS and telling people that it’s made for creators. Also, all these advancements in hardware but we have a QuickTime bug when we export footage. How is this still a thing when you’re spending so much money on a device built for “creative expression”. How is an iPad Pro M4 more expensive than an iPhone 15 Pro Max You’re about to make me make a bad financial decision Absence of Instagram app for iPad invalidates its appeal and price :( I don&#39;t think the iPad or any tab can anytime match a laptop use case. Atleast for my use cases. It&#39;s really cool to have this much power but it&#39;s useless if I can&#39;t run certain software or platforms on it. I currently use a mid Samsung tablet and I love the ease of using with my phone and connected features and a good windows laptop which allows to run major software, and costs less than the iPad itself even without considering the folio case and pencil lol. That toothbrush shot was crazy bruv Yea no bro. This product is for you and you only lol 10 years before an iPad feels useful?  That’s not saying much about Apple’s priorities.  The problem has always been the software. I think the speakers are going to be terrible Just ordered with the nano screen Why? Cause you&#39;re a hardcore Apple fan duh? Apple pricing is just on a different level You definitely don&#39;t get more gaming utility from an iPad. You&#39;ll find that out once you have it. Please go and tryout the Microsoft surface pro tablet<br>Never use my iPad after buying a Microsoft surface pro it&#39;s insane<br>Buy the pro version Not the go version or the RT version their is a difference There is absolutely no valid reason to spend 3600$ on an iPad. You have money and you are dumb, that&#39;s it ! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=537\">8:57</a> lol same, on my S23 ultra Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4. Answer: 18.5 million subscribers. Perfect for writing down ideas in a coffee shop, GEEEE 4 *   (GEEE means M). i’ll shell out the money when i can code on it 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ until then all this power is super meaningless like i’m not paying for an infinitesimally faster youtube screen This was a really good video, I watched MKBHD’s one and it was good, but this just gives such a good insight into what this iPad could mean for its target audience What’s $3600 to a millionaire I cannot understand why the hell people use macbooks when you can just install linux on a high end laptop for less than half the price. No the one main advantage that PC still has is that it is not a mac.. smh. CLICKBAIT , he doesn’t have it guys 😂 I feel like you’re spending, $3,300 worth of this iPad just for a pencil …..literally …a pencil<br><br>Sure you can play games, <br><br>But… so can my Xbox or PlayStation 5, my point is for some of this technology, I believe will be replaced by cloud computing in the future and what your left buying is a glorified screen for $3,300!!!<br> <br><br>it’s all good though somebody’s got to spend the money :/ i&#39;m just waiting for a time when the iPad and macbook are both ditched to bring out a hybrid which are better than both the Macbook and the iPad. The fact the matter is this you have over 18 million subscribers you&#39;re making a lot of money through YouTube. You can afford to buy the top range iPad use it for a while and if you don&#39;t like it return it. And if you don&#39;t like it send it to me LOL😂 You spend it to get 2.4M views 😂 hey Arun can i please have your old mac? please? At this rate Apple will release a Starbucks look a like Coffee Mug that connects with your phone and apple watch, yet people will still buy it for the price Them Cupertino boys done impressing Arun-bhai! 😃<br>Jokes aside - personally, as an owner of a recent iPad Pro (with the M-series chip), this seems an evolutionary step and likely wait for a generation or two for the OLED technology to evolve on Apple devices. So from that perspective, I am more in agreement with MKBHDs impressions in his &quot;awkward&quot; video especially considering the artificial software limitations due to iPadOS (versus an M-series Macbook Pro with MacOS) . <br>But if this is a first iPad Pro, this might not be a bad place to start. The real thing about it is iPad does not work like a computer. And you will not be able to use Adobe Creative Suite on it or do any hardcore computer work. Because apple does not allow that kind of freedom as a MacBook. So basically if you are paying over $3,000 for an iPad expect an iPad functionality. Unless Apple will finally give you the ability to use the full power of the iPad and be able to install computer programs to do your work. But of course they would never do that because they&#39;ll lose their computer Market Still...&quot;No Dual USB-C&#39;S &quot; With All That Power...<br>Guess What... Lenovo Legion Y700 2023 8.8 inch Gaming Android Tablet has Dual USB-C&#39;S...<br>🤯🧐🤓🥸😎...<br>Look it Up...<br>🤣 “Using it is crazy similar to a Mac”…unless you want to do anything a laptop can do other than use the web. It’s great hardware, just a terrible terrible OS Boy is he signing himself up to get disappointed. Apple&#39;s line up is truly messy. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s on purpose, but for instance just look at the apple pencil bs. 4 different versions. old apple pencils don&#39;t work with new ipads and vice versa. It is a mobile device. Mobile devices are seen by industry as consumer devices not productivity devices. They will never ever, ever be on par with computers. I wish they could, I genuinely wish we could ditch laptops but sadly ipados ios android they all suffer from being a dumbed down version of a computer. In fact this video just looks like an ad for ipad.... The amount of anti-Apple vitriol in these comments is… something. Honestly I think companies trying to make things thinner and thinner is dumb. That&#39;s just sacrificing how strong it is and making it easier to break. It&#39;s just not practical So.....<br>Just another tablet The next video is iPad Pro Vs Tab s9 Ultra🤣🤣🤣 imagine everything they had to crush to build those ipads I can&#39;t wait to buy one of these for what they&#39;re actually worth in 12 years. you are mandate to specify if this is a affiliated video.. showing that apple paid you Because u have more money then sense u mupet Apple paid good money for this video i love that he basically described a surface.<br>that thing even with apple M60 will still be an Ipad because despite what we think, it still relies on IpadOS and the appstore. so you can&#39;t instal anything else.<br>basically an ipad.<br>overkilled on top of that.<br>throw a paperlike onto your windows 11 surface and that&#39;s it you got it a PC that you can take notes with paper feeling, you can watch youtube to cook you latest recipe, and you can use any software ever, and thanks to intel unisson since windows 11 you can get you iphone texts and message people on you tablete 2 in 1.<br>perks, you can game with a Egpu plugged onto it for the price of the magic keyboard hahaha I read there could be a MacOS Lite for the iPad 🤷\\u200d♂️. All the other leaks were correct another reviewer who misses the point… for what u have described, just get the ipad air and keep your macbook… I  guess the ipad that I use daily will be my last one.  My ipad is a luxuary, not a requirement for me so, a new one has to be priced like a toy,ie., less than a thousand dollars or I won’t buy it. Overpriced garbaged Normally 1000 tho <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=946\">15:46</a> why don’t you have a personal server at home yet? you could have your own dedicated 200 terabyte server at home without needing to worry about cloud services or storage on your devices, all while being synced all the time. Also you can access your own server from any device with any o.s. <br><br>Seems kinda weird that you need terabytes of storage but don’t have your own server lol That&#39;s a lot of freaking money to spend on a toy.  Let them do it. Could you throw it away, please? Wait.. Does MAC even have games??? ROFL.. come on man... Gaming and mac??!?! Sorry.. my British.,.. but BOLLOCKS mate! News flash for you: You still live in a PC driven world my dude... Macs are a niche for the people that have no idea what they talk about but want to look &quot;cool&quot;, like it has always been... &quot;You don&#39;t even buy the whole Apple&quot;... I will stop with my comments here :) Good attempt at a video.. (Look at M$ vs 3 quarters of an apple &quot;valuation&quot; to see this a bit more clearer...) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> 💀💀 thanks you dont need any of em, you just can afford them. May i ask  what that writing pad was? iPads are significantly more limited than computers and honestly at this point, more by design and less by hardware. Most software wont run or isnt optimzied for touch and besides, still cant run IDEs or any real compilers on the iPad, making it an overpriced drawing tablet and youtube viewer. Old joke but still true.<br><br>Hope the future changes it, because it has a ton of potential. I bought one, it was like $1199. Did you get 10TB of storage? Apple should open it up to MacOS, it would make so much sense, but that will never happen. Just for fun i checked the website and the prices for add ons. This is really the most greedy company in history Title: Why I spent $3600 on ipad Pro m4.<br><br>Me: Because you can afford it Coz he will make lot more money from this video.

Bro are you on drugs? 🤣🤣 The same price as the Apple Vision Pro 💀 To have something for yet another video. Yeah. You didn’t sell me on this.  I thought you would have BEST OF ALL it&#39;s probably impossible to repair so they probably love that it could replace your laptop. YAY DISPOSABILITY I will never switch to an iPad, I prefer my MacBook Air wayyyy more Which e-ink device is that? BUT ITS SO THIN YOU GUYS Ipad pro with geforce now and a ps5 controller playing apex legends plz there is our biggest apple fanboy of the whole internet throwing all his money on an overpriced tablet!☠️ Comparing it with other tablets is not really a fair comparison when Android tablets have drastically worse chips @@bullishlucas yes but its to 100% not worth that amount of money @@chopstick134 The 3600, no, but base price is 1100-1300 @@bullishlucas i got my samsung for 550 and free watch. also with ipad you have to buy pencil cover too actually apples Apple TV remote is thinner I have been using Ipad Pro M1 for more than 3 years with Magic Keyboard<br>, and iPad Pro until now will never replace MacBook!! This makes me want to get the M2 iPad Air considering how much cheaper and overpowered the M2 still is Ipad is pointless. Only use is as a kindle or video player... $3k for a portable large screen Don’t do it!! It won’t work. Because you like burning/ flaunting money like money other YouTubers? Samsung&#39;s tablets are using phone chips... Okay ? You can play full on Cyberpunk 2077 on the 8 gen 3, you&#39;ll be fine with that kind of power don&#39;t worry Pretty much a paperweight. Of course when you have infinite funds you can spend it on whatever without worry. Everyone just want apple to make a Surface Pro. The answer is obvious - it’s because you have nearly 20 million subscribers and therefore earn enough money to buy damn near anything you want. 👏 👏 Don&#39;t waste your money! Lol see his excitement go down the drain on WWDC, not to mention his 3 grand :&#39;) What’s the new game on the iPad? Looks like a cool game. Still not a Mac. you know its bad when the ipad costs more then the vision pro. like thats mad Well I am not in market for new iPad Pro. Crazy money for a tablet…..Yes it maybe brilliant but as I have a perfectly good iPad Pro see zero reason to update. Let’s face it most people dont use their phones or ipad or even computers to their max. We love having the fastest best screen lightest you name it but we only utilise a small percentage of their true capacity. We buy into the hype because it sounds like we can be part of the cool crowd sitting in a coffee shop playing with our gadgets and become the next top cat this ipad is more expensive than the APPLE VISION PRO The only reason why its $3600 Is because he chose the most expensive options Thanks for going all in on the options so we feel smart not getting it. Amazing video as always. Love your content bro!! Tablets make phones inferior. My phone is good when I’m out. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=601\">10:01</a> i will resume later Small correction:  Google docs and slides are not great on IPad and specifically lack features for full time work use.  I often have to do tricks to get documents to open in Safari instead of the apps to access certain functions.  It’s a longstanding problem IMO. I don&#39;t understand why the M4 ipad is supposed to be 50% slower than an m1/m2 macbook. It makes no sense Ipad are also historically champions of longevity. You can mostly still use a 7 years-old iPad comfortably, even though battery life is terrible, for obvious reasons. So yes, I think the prices are justified given that you can keep it for 5+ years and use it everywhere - it’s £60 a month! OR you can just buy a much cheaper laptop and also use it 7+ years. Probably better to wait until you have the device before making the video? Bit of a weird one... I don&#39;t care how good it is, paying that much for a tablet is insane. But if you got it like that, keep shining 😊 Wow, I just thought about that. That you cannot get 5G on laptop, but you can’t find iPad. Honestly, with this kind of power, it&#39;s not a tablet anymore. It&#39;s a competitor to a Microsoft Surface. simple question why you buy it :D I go on tirades this long when &quot;hovering over the buy button&quot; too but unfortunately it&#39;s my poor spouse who has to listen instead of 18.5M subscribers 😂 I feel like this whole video was just him convincing himself it&#39;s okay to spend that much. He bought it for his job. Then made a video acting as if he didn&#39;t. Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4. Because it was worst and pointles to show how big is your ..... Secondly still apple has worst keyboard case ever. Secondly why they still not let to change curstor on iPadOS? Still too small. More power is completely uselss, IPad pro 2017 does everything I need. IPad Pro 16&#39; when? I don&#39;t want to carry around a $4000 piece of glass, but I guess I&#39;m just a broke boy. Yeah, Apple knew that the moment they allow iPad to boot MacOS, the Macbook sales will go down significantly. And they don’t want that😊 Agree bro If I even had the money to buy one, I’d rather take a used car.<br>It’s infuriating that even the keyboard is that expensive. I have an iPhone and will definitely switch back to android if it’s broken. You can&#39;t say you&#39;d rather game on a tablet than a computer if you only gamed on Mac Pro 💀 You’ll switch back to the macbook in like 2 days. iPad OS is dumb on ipad using youtube in safari desktop mode is much much much much better than the youtube ipad os app The fact that I just paid 1300 for a new iPad pro 12.9inch and apple pencil a few months ago feels like a slap in the face honestly but I&#39;m not gone upgrade and it was a huge investment to my business. This is wild hardware is amazing but iOS sucks. total rip off. Wait the iPad is HOW much!? Lmaooooo I have a last gen iPad Pro (I use for art and sometimes for streaming) a MacBook for music production and a PC for gaming, $3600 can buy two of those three things and get you soooo much further in doing literally anything. Apple is out of their minds these days I swear Capitalism is broken. I hope the ipad mini 7 pro will have 120 hz and will be compatible with the apple pencil pro. It would make sense. I bought a slightly used/like new 13 inch Ipad Pro 2020 with magic keyboard and it was great and I used it everyday. But after playing a mobile game for awhile it burned the back of the screen leaving it permanently discolored. Luckily it was on the edge of the screen and i for the most part not noticeable unless staring directly at it. The keyboard started rip it’s outer cover after about 3 years of use. Also the screen fell off because the double sided tape they used to keep it attached melted. The microphone also randomly stopped working. This tablet+keyboard with pen originally cost around $2k and I spent around $1200 on a lightly used model. Cuz you&#39;re a tech content creator, &amp; your job is to review stuff? couple of years ago i bought an ipad air 5th gen. my son still rocks with his learning videos while i do my work on PC. spent lot of $$$ but didn&#39;t use it. LOL 😁😁😁😁 I disagree with apples power management. If the battery health degrades to a certain degree, the device will no longer work at all. As an example, this is unsafe for anyone using it for flight navigation. The devices need to work when plugged in, regardless of battery health. Sadly, apple laptops are the same. Apple&#39;s ad crushed it. Didn&#39;t think I had principles until I watched that. <br>It&#39;s saved me thousands. Be real dude<br>The simple answer to why I got the new iPad is - I’m rich, I can afford it, that’s it. that tooth brushing looked a lil sus lol &quot;Movies are much better on a small phone screen than a big screen&quot;<br><br>......bruh, what a shill مين جا من فيديو اسئلة (دراغونوف)😂<br><br>سؤال مين يوتيوبرك المفضل If you will stop using your remarkable 2 I would love to have it. It would be usefull into school :DDD I never bought anything apple and never will. Something new that&#39;s thin and light just to have everyone put a thick ass case on it. Because you are richer than you can handle. so how many fps for cyberpunk? if you paying 4k for something with a CPU, it better run cyberpunk at 120fps minimum Software wise, the IPad is not going to replace a laptop. Until people start making more professional apps for it I watch quite a few tech channels. Yours is the only one I genuinely enjoy, regardless the subject. You have a comfortable, storytelling manner and are an orator of the highest order. Not Orson Wells great but outstanding in your own right. I never catch myself thinking, &quot;Is he done, yet?&quot;<br><br>Keep up the good work. Feel exactly the same way Most people buy these stuff to flex. Apple people like to look like they are productive with their tech. They are mostly using these stuff for YouTube, Netflix, Minor photo edit and writing useless notes. Real engineers, architects, programmers, video editors carry powerful Windows gaming PCs. Make video about quantum computing and explain how quantum computers work and also their benefits in modern technology , because nowadays quantum computing potential and its hype is rises day by day at internet. I’ll stick with my 2020 iPad Pro, which still does everything I (and probably 95% of users) want to do. I bought the last ones that came out. Not worth it. In the slightest. Before you receive the iPad u will get the amount for iPad to purchase great strategy Me watching it on the iPad 9 😭 The first apple foldable The Apple pencil (Gen 2) does have a hidden touch button. I so far am confused if it&#39;s still there or if they replaced it with the squeeze...<br><br>But that touch button is the main way you change between draw/eraser. The pro pencil still has the double tap feature <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=778\">12:58</a> What game is this? Thanks in advance. Because, you need content The ultimate skibidi toilet viewing device /j Do a video bout the gadgets you use mfana mahn like mentioned on this video “Very heavy laptop” I have a macbook pro m2 but I rarely use it because all I need is my iphone 15 pro.. sharing and editing on apps is so seamless and convenient these days. The screens and speakers are really good too for the size. But maybe it&#39;s just because I don&#39;t have a desk and I&#39;m currently living in a tiny room Me watching this on the tab s9 ultra. Which has basically replaced all my computer usage I may just get a generic stand if I get his iPad and use my Mac&#39;s keyboard instead when I swipe over with my trackpad since I do that with my current iPad after Apple&#39;s own keyboard stand broke on me. Maybe I&#39;m weird but I keep thinking at this rate, why note make the iPad be able to dual boot iOS and MacOS. Have the option to run MacOS when the iPad is hooked up with a keyboard, run iOS when standalone. If you do not use your laptop. Let me get it for school. Why are companies still making and people buying devices with square and sharp edges! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=60\">1:00</a> a phone is still small versus a 10-14 inch tablet people heavily tend to forget how power hungry AI is. Unless it is really a big upgrade, it is usually not worth it. Video enhancement is a good example. Cool you can enhance youtube videos a bit, but it comes at a hefty power cost and negligible image improvements. In video games, it is another discussion. But the irony is , that you only really need good AI if you are low on processing power already. <br><br>If you wanna run all kinds of AI functionality your system is gonna consume alot of power :)<br><br>Honestly. For personal use, I havent really seen it make any tangible difference. Maybe creating art is pretty cool, but the models are so stupid atm it feels like talking to a robot from the 60s.<br><br>All kinds of business use is viable, but I have yet to recognize a single use case for peoples everyday lives. the way you brushed had me concerning This dude is the biggest apple shill, they announce a new screen and a new chip, and now he’s realizing that the iPad can replace laptops for productivity, and the current iPad lineup literally does everything the new one does minus the pencil gyro thing which is a very niche use, Ive been using the iPad Pro for my university notes for 3 years now and I basically have my money’s worth, so the same old M1 ipad is still better value, the only thing I would say is good about the new iPad is how light it is, which helps for a campus dweller but the iPad air might be the better option in that case. Got rid of my laptop years ago. Got a MacBook and took it back. Now use my iPad with cellular all the time. Most useless Apple products:<br>Ipad<br>Iwatch<br>Apple vision pro Who else watching this on their IPad?😂 That tooth brush clip look weird In short. I did it so I could make this video When photoshop has all of the features of their desktop version, I can see myself making the switch. Artifitially limited*: yeah, iPadOS its way limited. Im still not able to format any drive, something that android tablets do since android kitkat. Its a beautiful piace of tech that is not going to cannibalize the macbook, and thats the big problem. I don’t even have to watch this. You spent it to make a video about it that pays for it. So he sat there from daylight to moonlight told us all about The iPad while just hovering over that buy button. because you can afford it porbably Review video of convincing yourself to buy a 1600USD tablet xD I would prefer a tab s9 cs i prefer the android OS and its like half the price <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=540\">9:00</a> wait till you see instagram on iPad 🤪🤪🤪 why?

It still functions so beautifully! <br>But if I were to upgrade now, I would upgrade to the iPad Air, especially now that it comes in a 13 inch size. I don’t think there’s any reason to get the Pro unless you need that specifically for your occupation My car was $1700 CAD 3600? apple is gettin ridiculous about prices... people start to get tired of these jokes... MArcus said it right, it can&#39;t do anything, the software just isn&#39;t there... I use my Ipad pro 2019 for art and 3d modelling when I don&#39;t want to sit at a desk but it still doesn&#39;t fit the bill for actual work machine Why? Coz you make a living reviewing stuff but, can it do Excel ? $3,600 is INSANE Tbh I&#39;d never buy an ipad, just because of the os and the apple ecosystem. I&#39;ve bought Samsung tab s6 lite &#39;22 for 300€ and I am using it for notes and even programming in school, when I don&#39;t want to bring my laptop, and it&#39;s amazing. The performance is acceptable, besides some stutters (it is a budget to mid-end device after all). <br>So I really don&#39;t think that average person would ever need such tablet, even as a replacement of a laptop. Arun: I am a 8TB guy<br>Me who&#39;s watching this on my 256Giggs MacM1 🥲 Answer: You wanted to make content by talking about it... jesus I wish Apple people would start saying &quot;no&quot; to these new insanely priced products. These new tablets bait. Do browsers on ipad have the same extensions as the ones on mac? Can you use bookmarklets on them? Understandably this guy has a tech channel, but the reality is he’s going to be surely disappointed because  iPad OS. This new M4 and do the M1 as well without breaking the bank. There is realistically no need for this iPad to exist until the iPad gets MacBook treatment with its software. I bought into the idea of them iPad replacing my laptop and even without the keyboard there is plenty of stuff a regular iPad Air or an iPad Pro from 2020 will replace the laptop for, but it doesn’t need to be the highest one to this frankly, you’ll never use half of it. do what I do and plug your iPad to a raspberry pi 4 if you really want “desktop replacement” even then I doubt most people would like a terminal. It finna fold from a drop i actually do everything on my Samsung smartphone (watch tv, play games, working, editing, documents, etc). I just use my laptop for protocol exclusive use, a lot of windows tools and services are still required to work. Huawei 13.2 inch Tablet are more way next level then ipad pro ,plus Huawei got free Pencil. Apple no😂💀 That is an obscene amount of money to pay for a tablet BUT i will buy it anyways. Thanks Arun! 8TB on a MacBook Pro is insane to me 😂😂😂 I think 1TB would be fine w me but hey what do I know I don&#39;t even own a MacBook Pro 😂😂😂 maybe one day I&#39;ll save enough for one... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=881\">14:41</a> <br>This has such great memeing potential Why ? because you are looking for views to line up your pockets.

I will buy 2 rtx 4090 in this price Pro Software sucks on ipad os it,s still limited with ipad OS, not worth the money, older iPads Pro do the same I think Apple should make a Final Cut Pro iOS Editing App for the iPhone and iPhone Pro. Seriously, you were able to fill 16 minutes with info about this... ?  You coud have stopped immedately after $3600. Everything after that was irrelevant. Bought an Ipad 1,5 year ago and i do regret it. I use it for school mostly, but apps like Word and Excell aren&#39;t optmized well enough. I still need a laptop do to basic stuff in word.... It&#39;s not ideal if you go to school. Working in environments like Teams, aren&#39;t that great aswell.. I can&#39;t create documents inside the app to share with group members ect. It still lacks alot of functions. Despite waiting for 1,5 year now, it&#39;s not ideal for me. Great video, thank you and have fun with the IPad. We need folks to do a durability and a real world test, like when a toddler sits and walks over it. this happens when every new iPad comes out - every creator makes a &quot;this will replace my Mac&quot; video... until iPadOS get better you are not replacing your Mac... you are going to buy the iPad make a few youtube videos then return it. Apple sheep being a programmer I think that I would never be able to switch to iPad.<br>But for every other person I think that it will be possible pretty soon The reason for such a drop off in iPad sales was their durability. They were future-proofed so much that there was little need to buy a new one every two or three years. There is less reason to upgrade your iPad compared to a phone, because they aren’t where your point and shoot camera resides. I’ve just pulled the trigger on a new iPad Pro, six years after buying the 2018 model. Not because I wanted the latest and greatest, but because I wanted to pass down this iPad, which still works really well, and get myself a new one that will keep me ahead of things for several years. There is less need to purchase iPads when they just keep going. Mine is primarily for drawing and design work, which there is no substitute for in my book. 3600 dollars? Damn, fuck that.<br><br>You said it, it is obscene.<br><br>This will face the same criticism as the  super thin macbook from back in the day.<br><br>Apple, instead of working on actual problems like the battery and the lack of ports, instead they add features that aren’t necessary. Why? Because you have 18 Million subs ... what a nice ad to watch.<br>The iPad will never be a Laptop replacement in its form these days. Yes, the hardware specs are impressive and if its only about this, its possible- BUT, since this thing still runs iPadOS ... how are you gonna replace a desktop os with a tablet, when the tablet still runs a &quot;lite os&quot;.<br>The only thing these iPads lack is MacOS ... To make a video 🤷 I gave up on the iPad when I was in college and I needed to load a website just to get “Not compatible with Mobile browsers” 😵… I’ll keep my M3 MB Air, iPhone 14PM and just add the M2/M3 iPad Air if the new iOS is worth the upgrade🤷🏾 1, because you already made that money back posting this video 2. you&#39;re a multi millionaire 3. its a tax write off for your business.. so yeah you spent 3.6k bc its negligible I love watching movies so I prefer the S9 over this one. This one is just garbage. Few are for work. Just take a PC if you are looking for something good for work. When is the screen of the iPad going to look like the Samsung tablets? Those things are elite. If it can run premiere pro with the power of my pc I might consider jumping ship Both suck compared to Windows Laptop or  Handheld LMAO Obviously, give the iPad the ability to run MacOS or Windows, and you’d see pretty easily spank a majority of handhelds and laptops. @@theramennoodler7950 that&#39;s the whole point dude <br>It&#39;s like giving Z1 extreme the efficiency of M3 <br>You can&#39;t.

All the things he mentioned are justification that every tech company provide at the launch, which to be honest never provide value for money. I see the appeal, I’m in art school in graphic design and I have a friend who categorically refuses to use a mac, he’s fine with ipads tho. He specialises in illustration and for him an ipad was game changing, he drew like 3 times more and better. The crazy expensive ipad from the video is the crazy maxed out one, nobody needs that i agree, but a 1500-2000€ ipad is completely acceptable. Why ? just look at the premium graphic tablets prices, it is outrageous for just a “screened trackpad” and ipad is very similar in drawing capabilities, does way more than juste being a graphic tablet, and is cheaper. its come to the point where apple is just like designer clothes. people just buy it for the apple tag and to look rich. there are so many tablets that are even better and below 1k dolalrs @@dada.yoshiki Dont forget after 5 years when the battery is degraded you cant use the ipad work outside. Unlike the macbook pro once the battery is dead you can still plugged it and use it as a worksation at home with multiple screens. Not to mention most apps in ipad os are subscription base. There are artists, especially in the comics industry, that only use iPads pro for their work.

Apple is not a baby company but a tech giant with 50 years history creating big trends in the industry. They are not a &quot;phone&quot; company. When you buy an Apple product you don&#39;t only get a phone. You get Apple Music, Apple books, Tablets, Apple TV, Apple computers, Apple watch, Home Pod and much more. This is an ecosystem. All these products work perfect together under IOS software. Once you are in it, it is hard to leave it away. This is not because of cultish behavior but a choice of an amenity. Calling it a cult is really nonsense. Even sometimes ppl get divorce easily than getting rid of their apple  products. The only iPad I find useful is the mini I bought one, tried to use for class, in the two weeks I had it I ended up using like twice before returning it.

But the fact that Apple sells an average of 30 billion dollars worth of iPads per year, it&#39;s obvious there is an enormous market for the devices.

BUY I&#39;m wandering what your impressions will be because i was given a free iPad with the purchase of a web app 4 years ago and i was thoroughly disappointed too learn the ipad couldn&#39;t even run the web app (because apple only allows &quot;skins&quot; of other web browsers on their tablets but the engine still uses Safari). I tried using it for work but all the apps are stripped down and buggier versions of computer apps. If you connect a keyboard to make it work a little better at that point you might as well have a laptop. Ultimately, because of the way Apple limits what is allowed on iOS the device ended up being nothing more than a decent way to consume media. So I&#39;ll put a cartoon on Netflix or YouTube for my kids when i need to distract them for a minute. But i rarely use it myself. guys, did anyone know how long he has been talking? his background is night time Ipad pro 12&quot; are the worst products because they still use ipad os. They are a computer, yet they are glorified phones. Time for them to use macos, otherwise I find them useless. $3300 for a glorified phone, which does not have any glamorous features other than recycled content, is asinine. You’ll be disappointed eventually, mark my words And it still has Ipad OS. lol Signed Ipad for a lucky sub. 🎉 Love your show btw. Much live 🫶. whats the name of the other table with ink screen? It&#39;s still a glorified bigger version of an iPhone. No M chip of this world can save the iPad from being useless, until Apple straight up puts MacOS or a derivative on it.<br><br>MacOS already can run iOS Apps, they would maybe need to work a bit more on compatibility and that&#39;s it.<br><br>Most people after a while of owning it will use it, if even that, as a media consumption machine.<br><br>It&#39;s also too big for a lot of iOS games, and not all games have controller support, so no... the iPad is not the best of both worlds.<br><br>I&#39;m sure there are UseCases where it would actually help someone out, but that&#39;s definitely a very niche user base. Probably for pen dependant jobs it might deliver. But I for example after graduation didn&#39;t use the pen except to sign documents a few times.<br><br>iPad external display support is also crap. Samsung with their Dex and Microsoft with their full WindowsOS on their Surface Pro devices, are just better alternatives.<br><br>Heck with Microsoft you have a whole arsenal of games available to you. With that kind of a budget, you might get a Surface Pro device + a good eGPU and you can do whatever with it.<br><br>If you really want an iPad, get an older Pro version or get an Air (to anyone looking for advice and having at least one braincell left to think)<br><br>Kinda funny though how good the Apple marketing is. People actually think it is a good idea to pay that amount of money for that useless thing... Problem with tablet is their OS. It&#39;s fundamentally different than a laptop has. So even if you have the same apps and computing power as on your laptop, I cannot be as productive with a tablet as their OS forces a different workflow on me, costing me time.<br><br>Also for simple tasks like you have a file in the cloud, let&#39;s say a pdf. I will make notes in this file using both devices. You would think that would be no issue at all, especially when I was using an apple laptop and I an iPad - with Google cloud, though. That stupid iPad kept saving new versions of the same file in the file system. So everytime I had to use the newest file that had been created without me wanting it. I wasn&#39;t able to get that fixed - the pdf app on iPad OS always would download a local copy and not mutate the original in the cloud.<br>Really annoying, especially if you use all apple products.<br><br>So, tablets will most likely be entertainment devices for me in the near future. That might be different in 5y, though. Who knows?<br><br>Edit: He points out the file system as it&#39;s main flaw as well.... What a coincidence 😂 Any none Apple user will be laughing hard at this one🤣🤣. at this point, people don&#39;t buy apple product because it is worth it or not , is it just like buying a Gucci or Luis Vuitton shirt. Brand ! You didn&#39;t spent that. I wouldn&#39;t afford even with credit Simple word:<br><br>No. You should do a video about the Box AiR 3/3C. It can do so much more than the remarkable. And no subscription. Nope. Way too cheap for me. Still not smart though…. &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4&quot; - So that you can make 10 times as much with this YouTube video. That made me laugh😂 You’re the first tech reviewer who has pointed out the advantages of the iPad running iPadOS rather than MacOS whilst still considering it as a viable laptop replacement. I now understand why Apple still keeps making the iPad Pro I shook my head and laughed when Steve Jobs first said it, and I&#39;m still shaking my head and laughing. I could never consider an iPad as a computer replacement because what makes a computer a computer is the file system. I guess for the people who don&#39;t care about a file system, then yes, an iPad can replace a computer. But for me, a file system is essential. @@mikemccormick6128Also if you’re a coder, tablets serve no purpose.

From the start There&#39;s a reason MacOS is designed for the clamshell notebook devices and not for the devices with multi-touch UI. And there is a reason It&#39;s an iPad and not the Mac. Target consumer is a layman, school- college guy, and even the working professionals who don&#39;t prefer complexity of the Mac and want the straightforward UI of iPad. And even if Apple design MacOS around multi-touch, it would only complex the device further, which is not what apple likes to do. In my humble opinion people demanding iPad to run Mac OS are simply lost and have no clue how Apple function. i know a apple paid promotion when i see one 😂 And here we go again, someone who never really used an iPad is trying to replace his MacBook. This will end in disappointment within 1 month of using it because iPadOS is barely usable. The iPad is good for just 3 things, writing, drawing, reading/media consumption.. everything else is a chore to do on it. Hi, great video! Can you please mention the function of Office Apps (Word, Excel, Powerpoint...) on iPad. Because one of the biggest reasons I would get Macbook instead of iPad is exactly the poor function of IOS version of them.<br>Thanks. watched full video with 4 unskipble 20 second ad 🙂 you can dowload from the netflix on the laptop if you have the app You posted this on my birthday This is clickbait. There is nothing that has changed much from the last iPad Pro from the perspective of replacing your laptop. The problem with replacing your laptop is the software. Until they update the software it won’t replace the laptop. The software limits it. every time apple release a product and saying &quot;this is the most powerful device yet&quot; <br>People waiting 2040 to get  the &quot;most powerful device  yet&quot; thinking they saved  20 IPAD models..<br><br>Arun still saying the same thing for next 26 years..🤣 And 3 x Samsung add came on hmm 😂 i was the toothbrush 🫠 ...and I wanted to make a video about this because it&#39;ll pay for this iPad many, many times over! 😄 Why?

There&#39;s no way it costs apple more than 700$ from production to shipping . and how do you justify the limitations of IpadOS? Ipad will never replace mac till the time it starts using  MacOS. It’s because you have too much money bruh and you’re gonna make even more money with the videos about the tablet. A tablet with PC processor and kindergarten OS. Should I buy MacBook Pro or this ??? macbook pro definitely Hovering over the buy button, with the urge to purchase based on peer pressure. Just imagine. Also, it doesn&#39;t replace eink writing. Everything else is subpar. iPad Pro: “First OLED tablets with LTPO, first OLED tablets with a tandem stack, matte nano-texture display, brightest and longest life OLEDs in tablets, lightest and thinnest OLEDs tablets as well due to glass thinning and TFE”. I see it the way you do. I got it primarily for the display but I’m just a hobbyist so I didn’t want to invest in one of those oled gaming monitors just yet. And it’s a great device for note taking and other mobile stuff. I don’t need it to produce a lot because I have a specced out pc so having it supplement my work and play is appealing Also buy Samsung&#39;s tablet with keyboard and compare them! Since they are very similar in many aspects it and Dex is better than Center Stage, it would be a very worthy comparison! Illustrator here, I love my iPad Pro! I use it for drawing, and that’s it. Otherwise I agree, phones can fill every need aside from drawing space. Do an iPad battery test Those who actually need it, can&#39;t buy it.<br>Those who buy it, doesn&#39;t need it and use only a little Definitely going to wait and see what WWDC has in store in terms of software side of things before considering this. As of right now it&#39;s just a x4 as fast Netflix machine as my M2 iPad Pro. how about the google pixel 8a because it should soon come out Love your perspective! Apple people.... sigh<br>Good luck. Hope it works out very well. Nahhhhh iPad still can’t smoothly transfer big files from one OS to another. Still a fancy tablet at best. Imagine having a standardized port yet limiting transfer due to different file systems. What I want to know is how games from capcom and ubisoft perform in this version of the ipad. They started porting Resident 4 and 8 during the ip15 announcement and from what I heard it only runs on 720p. I hope you include those when you release your experience with it. $3000 and no gpu , now that’s a ripoff Because you can lol Today I basically understand why apple never done a touchscreen computer cuz the day they doing that the will kill iPad market… they making us a kind of phone with a computer chip… I’m ain’t buying that You make this so unbiased.

If they can coax or help port Mac apps and Audio Units from third party developers to iOS I&#39;ll happily use an iPad but for me, not yet. I tried to replace my laptop with an iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard a few years ago and it was an awful experience. The OS alone holds the iPad back. You just can’t do on a tablet what you can do on a laptop. Hard to justify the price. i am sure apple is very happy with the title. sponsored? For decades now I have searched for that elusive one-device-to-rule-them-all, and after spending thousands of dollars on various &quot;hybrid&quot; devices I have come to the conclusion that no such device will ever exist. There will always be a trade-off to a dedicated laptop, tablet, and phone, and ultimately if your workflow requires all 3, then invest in good devices in each class. Trust me, the jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none hybrid device will always end up being a subpar experience. Hey Arun if you don&#39;t want that remarkable tablet i will gladly take it.

Why should this be the year of switch from MacBook to iPad? 1 cm smaller and 100 gr less weight? Or is it just the better screen? Almost every reason to switch could have been mentioned for the last iPad Pro Finally an iPad worth upgrading from my 12.9” 2020 iPad Pro, which I have been using as my primary device since then. Four years out of any tech these days is a win in my book. Since my Magic Keyboard and Pencil is four years old, I don’t feel so bad about having to upgrade. They both have just enough updates that make them worth it. My trade-in value just covers that cost. Can’t justify the 1T or 2T for my use though, 512K keeps it in a decent price range for a 4 year shelf life. Thanks for the convincing review. The system should be taken into account. MacBook doesn&#39;t support NTFS on default. But it can read and write on external devices with other softwares. <br>The place where my files stored are optional on MacBook. But this cannot be done on iPadOS. That means 2TB model is useless for the most people. Yeah, my guy, you are reaching on this one. Stop the nonsense, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m paying over 3k for an iPad. All the points you made are frivolous and one dimension.

TLDR!<br>Your episodes are becomming more like software... &quot;Bloadware-videos&quot; now. Get to the point man! Yeah... problem is iPadOS. If Apple doesn&#39;t do anythng besides &quot;AI AI AI&quot; for iPadOS, then no. This thing isn&#39;t even REMOTELY capable of replacing your MacBook, regardless of hardware. Can you compare the Tab S9 ultra with this? It&#39;s great, but I do really dislike installing so many apps for each different services, you end up with over a hundred different apps, sometimes for things you only use very occasionally bruh tablets have done this a long time ago I actually use the iPad Pro for work and I hate how limited it is by its OS. Some apps work fine, but the ones importatnt to me (MS Office, Google Meet and such) are mostly nerfed versions with significantly limited functionality and bizzare compatibility issues.<br>More processing power is literally the last thing I need. I hope this year&#39;s iPadOS brings something new to the table, because I&#39;m definitely not buying a MacBook just to handle professional text editing. wow <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> that got me off guard 💀💀 An Ipad pro creates the illusion of productivity and at the end is just a big phone when you are at home. Even taking notes with the pencil is a terrible experience. I have the M2 and i cant justify the price At least the $3600 iPad has a better battery life than 2 hours and doesn&#39;t physically hurt to use after an hour.... The Best IPad case Is the Chesonia Case. It has a full HDMI port and 2 USB 2.0 ports and a head phone jack. It has a usb c port but that is only for charging.  It has full RGB black light keyboard and a supports Apple Pencil charging and a slot to put it when you close the screen. <br><br>I’ve gotten rid of my 2017 MacBook Pro and started using my 2021 iPad Pro and found an app equivalent on iPad for every desktop app i use. Including replacement for iTunes, video editing/conversion , application coding, etc. so for my use cases my iPad is a computer There is not a reasonable justification on why you would do such a thing. It&#39;s your money, you can do whatever you want, just wanted to let you know that you are part of the problem since you clearly support extreme overpricing, and the criminal business practices of Apple and other equivalent companies.  And I know you dont care...If only consumers had brain... iPadOS is still just too limiting for laptop duty imo. I tried writing with Google Docs and a browser in split screen, but when I wanted to juggle a third and fourth app, it just got far too clunky. I was missing my MacBook in minutes. Well, I would not pay $3600 USD (close to $5000 CAD) for a laptop, or a desktop, let alone a tablet.  It is insane. We need MacOS to merge with iPadOS. A MacPadOS. Adobe needs to allow all their desktop applications on iPad. Dude, don&#39;t talk so good about the new iPad. The only new thing is the front camera. It has the same software that can&#39;t do more than other tablets. I don&#39;t know why these YouTubers give so much relevance to small things that are the same as the last three years&#39; iPad Pro. At least give an honest review.  Sometimes I believe that Apple really pay them to talk, and I&#39;m not surprised that they do that. Prode to watch in ipad Day 3 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop.

Because you have a good bank account? 😂 I would bet that if he actually dropped his Macbook for an iPad he would run into the software limitations of final cut and audio production really quick. They been doing this for ages cash grabbing using their &quot;powerful chip&quot; but not allowing users to use it&#39;s full potential. They even change the sizes just to force you to buy their new accessories.

At the end of the day is a tablet. And 90% of things you do in tablets laptops or PCs can do it 100 times better. Trust me Lenovo tab p12 is the same but it&#39;s android and it&#39;s 300$ and not only this there are tons of nice big screen tablets on the market for affordable prices <br> so why waste money for a brand ? I almost replaced my laptop with a Galaxy Tab S7 FE. I even code on my tablet. it&#39;s crazy to know that apple are now paying youtubers to promote their products Not having the ability to install custom software (not coming from the app store) will always make me prefer MacOS over iPadOS.

But the inability to run Xcode on iPad is my limiting factor. <br><br>So Apple still is losing double on a power user like me. Instead of getting the latest or a second year newer replacement, I&#39;m keeping my MacBook Pro and iPads much longer. If I can&#39;t get what I want, then I&#39;ll just wait until the pain point is enough where I upgrade. It&#39;s 100% inexcusable that apple doesn&#39;t have Xcode on iPad, especially considering they sell a keyboard with a trackpad, and the iPad Air makes 100% no sense at all. not worth it I&#39;m really curious about the <b>actual</b> use case here - like, what do you actually do? I see ads of people holding it with one hand and editing photos with another - there are literally 0 actual photographers who has a workflow like that and not expect to starve to death. Can the iPad Pro connect to more than 1 screen? No matter what hardware is underneath it, iPadOS is still a limited, tablet OS. The thinness is cool and all, but who complained that the current iPads are too thick? For the amount of money for the iPad Pro, if you are actually needing to do a lot of work, might as well get a laptop with an OS that&#39;s not nearly as limiting as the one iPad has. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=432\">7:12</a> what is that game? the irony of this amazing, exciting review is that my main takeaway is how much I want one of those remarkable tablets Same here all the specs are useless as u can use the capabilities of the ipad to the fullest get an ipad with an M1 chip and u wont notice the diffrence \\u200b@@usamashehab8138 yep, this was my main takeaway, all of this has been possible from the moment iPads started using Mac chips, now it&#39;s just a tiny bit faster, and as long as iPad OS doesn&#39;t get better, like a normal pc, most of the speed improvement is pointless, unless you do a lot of hardware intensive work, just get an older M1 chip iPad I don&#39;t get where the &quot;irony&quot; is, is my brain not working properly or are people just saying &quot;irony&quot; with a new meaning now? @@da4127 I was definitely using the standard definition of &quot;irony&quot;! The irony being that this video is promoting a new tablet which is supposedly so amazing that it might replace Arun&#39;s MacBook AND his ReMarkable tablet, yet the result of the whole pitch was making me want to buy the ReMarkable tablet instead. We are now in the domain of luxury. Rich people buy cars that look nice and are fast, but are a pain when parking or shopping.<br><br>These iPads are the same, they offer some advantages you don&#39;t really need and come with so many disadvantages. <br><br>Just buy a normal car, a normal phone and a normal laptop and let the rich people play with their fancy toys.

Unfortunately I am not weathy enougth. Love the video. Just fyi I’ve now had to subscribe to your channel( which I’ve followed for over 3 years) for the 3rd time.  Something keeps unsubscribing me. Bad YouTube 😂 I have a Samsung tablet and I gotta say, that thing gets so much use.  I used to not really care about tablets in more recent years, but I can call, text, watch media and use it for laptop stuff.  I do think tablets can be very useful. but should they cost so much? Would you pay $3000 for one? I have a gazillion laptops and tablets. I initially got tablets because I thought it was ridiculous that I should be &quot;forced&quot; by companies and governments to do important stuff on the phone&#39;s 6 inches (and forced we are, as phones are deemed safer than laptops from viruses etc by many higher powers). There&#39;s so little you can comfortably do on the tablet versus a laptop, and, for sanity&#39;s sake, if we limit the discussion to Apple devices, there&#39;s so little that can detract from the nice package that the M1 Air was, or the 15 inch M3 Air. Got to be said, if you can afford one you can probably afford the other, so over the long run you&#39;ll either end up with a wardrobe full of shoes like many females, or boxes full of semi-expired electronics :) @@DavidFrankland No, that&#39;s why he has a Samsung, which already comes with the pen included Ridiculous price for a tablet. My 12&quot; S7+tablet has more features, and it&#39;s been around for years. it&#39;s funny how many more slow people are in the comments on Apple products vs anything else What game was that shown in the vid? I own an ipad pro. I love it. But i use it less than I thought. It is just an overpriced tablet. I wish I could do more.. That sweater is gawjus I’ve recently changed my laptop for a tablet. I’m a teacher and the touchscreen makes my work much faster to be done, along with the fact that it’s more portable when I’m walking around the classroom talking to the kids. That been said, all my external keyboards, when connected to iPadOS, don’t work with Google’s services on the Web, and the app for the iPad is more limited than the online version, so now I can’t work with it. Luckily the school uses an Android tablet, and the keyboard works just fine. Looking forward to selling my iPad and getting a Samsung tablet instead. Title should have been &quot;Sponsored by Apple though this piece is actually shit&quot; Us though Apple fully speced is $3,077 just to let y’all know it’s not that bad lol This iPad is screaming from Apple..buy it as we can&#39;t figure out what else can be done on this tablet..... Simple because you have the money. Easy. 😊 Because you&#39;re a tech YouTuber making videos about new tech duh i like how we watched the day go by 🤣 unless they revamp ipadOS, the best it can be is for artist to draw on it Probably right up there with Apple Vision in the worst purchase ever category.... It&#39;s a waste of money. If you have money to waste, then buy it, else give it a big dose of swerve. My money is on the new Snapdragon chips + Windows Tablets. In practical use even a Surface tablet with M2 performance/Battery Life would still grossly outweigh the new Ipad M4 running IpadOS. Excellent video‼Just some friendly advice : Please try to make a video every 4 days instead of 2 quick videos in 2 days... then we don&#39;t have to wait a week or 2 for the next video.😉🌠 Oh yeah...by the way $3600 for a iPad is ridiculous! I would rather want a cheaper laptop. Imagine spending money on Apple. I still prefer desktop OS in tablet form. sorry but its a rich person talking rich problems with rich solutions, 0 real world aplication Instead of paying for TB of storage to get the nano screen option, just buy the paper-like screen protector and save yourself a boatload of money. That tablet is more expensive than my rtx 3080 and i9 laptop It&#39;s a bit sad to see @Mrwhosetheboss slowly becoming an apple fanboy. It&#39;s no way you can justify spending this much money on a tab which can barely do things a pc do (unless you are the 0.1% of the people who do very specific stuffs). So unless Apple gives the iPad Pros the capability of a MacOs, this doesn&#39;t make any sense. I own an iPad pro 11 inch and I regret buying it. It&#39;s a great powerhouse but it&#39;s sad to see that you can do so less stuffs with it. Because Apple pays you mate ... I need to be a YouTuber content creator lol then do a speed test ipad pro m4 versus the same price on PC $3,600 This is the best argument I&#39;ve seen yet to justify the crazy cost of these things, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m convinced.<br><br>I have been saying for 6 months &quot;when the new OLED iPads come out I&#39;m going to buy one&quot;.  I am currently using a 2020 iPad Pro with a partially cracked screen.<br><br>But when I configured what I wanted (13&quot;, 512GB, wifi-only) it came out to $1500; add the new pencil and I&#39;m paying &gt;$1600.  Is my life really going to change that much versus my current iPad?<br><br>When I ditched my PC last year and bought a Mac Studio, and when I ditched my old RAZER laptop and bought a Macbook Air, those purchases were life changing and I do not regret one penny of the cost.  This one seems a lot more borderline! Nah, people use their pc with a 4090 to watch youtube more than they game on it 3600$ equals 1000+bd<br>It costs here 450bd Oh yea, macbook is 500bd Day 2 of asking for some used review gadgets to convert into a funding for prosthetics Need one comparison video of m4 IPad Pro with Samsung s9 tab ultra Lol you can thank gamers for the popularity of these Why? God damn. My whole Gaming PC was only CAD $2308.73. I might get the new iPad Air 2024 though Hey can you buy the pixel 8a the new phone made by Google pls Because you want views The issue with tablets is they only run iOS. Sometimes, for a lot of programs and functionality, you need the full blown OS. Not a mobile OS. As such, I find it impossible to justify personally spending that kind of money on a tablet device, regardless of use case. It just lacks the fundamentals. I&#39;m surprised this video is being made in 2024. 2019-2020 was the period where iPad Pros really took off on the performance and portability side. I bought one - the OS and consistent limitations of apps is the system&#39;s fatal flaw. It shouldn&#39;t be MacOS, but its functionality has to be much closer to it to make the added cost worth it. I still think this is primarily a creative&#39;s tool which can occasionally - but maddeningly inconsistently -  replace a laptop&#39;s productivity functions. dude u can’t justify that price tag, as much as like apple products Bro wanted to justify buying an ipad (i have m1 ipad and i love it) His life is so posh he actually convinced himself he needs it for a very specific situation lol Btw - Nano Coating you WILL regret! Mark my words! What about you are going to make I phone I&#39;m shocked that this channel has as many subs as Good Mythical Morning... It&#39;s bewildering cos u rich lor thats why. or silly bro didn&#39;t account for taxes 💀 No taxes after sales in UK, price you pay is as advertised @@georgeharrison2795 WHAT, that is so wild (I am canadian and have 27% sales tax 💀) @@NethanielMCIn the UK, the tax is already added into the price right before purchase… so it looks like you are not paying any tax but they pay around 20%. Thank you so much for spending $3600 of your hard earned money so we can see just what the top end ipad can do. That&#39;s quite a sacrifice. Bruh, the title shocked me so much that I had to comment… I did not know this new iPad costed THIS much ☠️☠️☠️ this costs more than what I paid for my M1 Max 14” Listening to you talk is so exhausting...LoL sorry Another boring Apple product! I just wish I could have mac OS on the ipad. Unthinkable this can go up to 3600 lmaoo wtf 😂 bought the base pro myself though, excited for it. First iPad I’ll own since the first mini 💀 I tried making the switch, but iPad OS is the limitation. Those you browse the web, email, etc. it’s a better solution aside from the clunky file management system.<br><br>But working on the web in digital marketing and development it’s still not there. Mazel tov on the wedding. Imagine spending a pc worth of money on a tablet just to find a kid watching yt kids on it Most powerful Youtube and Netflix machine. Bro you did not even buyed the tablet Can you imagine spending the same amount of a laptop for a tablet only to get a cover that becomes a keyboard just because you want to use a pen on the screen? .... yes, $3k please! 🤯 Tim cook: wow!😮😮<br>Consumer: aaaoo!😨😨 I have Lenovo yoga laptop, it&#39;s pretty fun to use as tablet in windows games (I can use screen instead of mouse in games such as slay the spire) I really like iPhone 12 pro max but if I can&#39;t afford one, please buy me an iPhone 12 pro max. It will be a big help. I don&#39;t have a phone to do my work in university. Please buy a big help.😢😢 Shill ... for apple. put a keyboard on it ... and call it a computer Key deal breaker for me is definitely operating system. Can&#39;t run x86 desktop applications? It&#39;s out then. Versatility on the iPad has always been gimmicks to me, it may feel good but I really can&#39;t see how it&#39;s better than using a proper laptop. Few more reasons for apple to be unreasonably expensive 😂😂😂 He spent that money because he’s rich beyond belief I just use my Ipad for watching YouTube videos and checking my email. It doesn’t matter how good it is when it is limited by iPadOS. Qual o jogo q ele está jogando aos <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=777\">12:57</a> ? Problem is ipad os not ipad - ipad os vs mac is shit… Last two months, since the Sonoma update, i no longer able to use my ipad pro as a drawing tablet. I&#39;d complain it to the Apple store, and their sales just told me to buy a new one. 🙄 I feel like fallen into their planned obsolescene agenda! I&#39;ll not buy into it, my China-made xp-pen last longer than my ipad pro. 😡 (xp-pen  died after 9 years due to wear and physical drop, ipad pro not working due to fking OS update 2 months b4 new device launch! 🙃) People who get these things must be super rich, like dude I&#39;ll just build a really powerful pc for that price, you can watch netflix, play AAA games, use it for work, run powerful softwares, etc<br>All in one<br>I mean yeah it can do it too but on a much smaller screen<br>dosent this just target some super niche audience ? <br>how do they manage to stay profitable on this device ? Im guessing that Apple will move iPadOS closer to MacOS this summer with enough puffer to not replace the MacBook Air’s. Especially this new generation of iPad‘s but even the last two are so ridiculously overpowered, it just doesn’t make any sense to run them on the same system as the baseline iPad. So... Can we talk about how Microsoft Surface was essentially doing what Apple is trying to do with an iPad right now. The only key difference is that Apple is trying to make a mobile OS work as a Desktop one, while the Surface always were using a full Windows OS. It maxes out at £2599. Totally nailed it for me. Exactly all the points I was thinking about spoken out loud. Another point worth mentioning: For folks who&#39;s workplace has moved onto virtual desktop (i.e. Citrix), the Citrix iPad app pretty much allows you to have a Windows PC on your iPad - how sick is that! Of course you&#39;d spend so much on the iPad. If not you then who? It&#39;s only designed for people like you and people who want to flex. Not for your audience. what the sketchbook name? Bro is mrbeast buying everything you talk too much bro, I lost patience 🤣 Yeah thats cool but where&#39;s the calculator 😅 totally useless video. You complicating simpler stuff. A comparison is simpler, but your divig into &quot;your&quot; problems for the comparison and review. I would like to ask you why you&#39;re reviewing only the apple environment products. It seems clear to me you&#39;ve made up your mind already for iPad and just clearly compromising most stuff for &quot;your&quot; iPad. Neither the video review, comparison is absolutely biased.

Just curious Short Answer: Because you can afford it. <br><br>I’m sure the new iPads are great and all but they’re still iPads at the end of the day. I don’t think Apple would allow iPads to use powerful software even though the tablet is capable of running them. I wished it had a MagSafe connection like the iPhones, it is super useful and convenient. Not sure how they could efficiently do it on a such big device, but I really hope we see more wireless charging going forward Because you&#39;re wealthy? :-&lt; iPads Pro? MacBooks Air?

Im a 8 inch tablet guy for daily use even to make phonecall.. my wife call it the face fone...coz it cover my face when im on a call that&#39;s like the... opposite of the wisest decision of your life Just marketing and brand just making money, i bought M2 macbook pro 13months back and now display is getting black screen to replace display they charging 860sgd worst investment ever just buy less expensive windows laptop i thought you are dead 8tb 🌝 MrWhosetheAppleFanboi Chicken nugget Well done! Since the iPad Pro was introduced, this is the BEST review about that product! Everyone else enthusiastically repeats the advantages of the hardware &quot;a modular MacBook Air with a stylus and touchscreen and the latest M chip for laptops&quot; (incorrectly called &quot;iPad Pro&quot;, and wrongly equipped with iPhone software!), but no one mentions the biggest problem: THERE IS NO SOFTWARE FOR THE IPAD PRO!!! But there is a price for a laptop! The iPad Pro product is not an attempt by Apple to offer consumers a top-notch product and experience during use, but rather to test their unintelligence! Any user who has logged in with an iPad Pro and has not logged out after 4 weeks of use is probably recorded by Tim Cook as an irreparable zombie who cannot be helped and is not worth Apple&#39;s effort to save and take with them when the asteroid that will destroy the planet comes! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=524\">8:44</a> I think the screen is not fingerprint resistant You only buy an ipad for that money simply because you have that money and you can. Its a tablet. Its not worth 3000+ Idk what he’s yapping about iPads aren’t replacing pcs both have different features and needs. If you put touch on the MacBooks and make them 180 degree foldable they gonna replace iPads in an instant. There is no need for an iPad other than its touchscreen that is why Apple didn’t made touch laptop to this day. this is exactly how I convince myself when I am going to buy something expensive... &quot;use their app than direct me to their website&quot;<br><br>That depends, eh?

The main reason most people buying them is for drawing. And the people who just want to watch YouTube and Netflix they can buy cheaper models. Pre-ordered the 11inch.

Stage Manager still seems an idea that&#39;ll lower your productivity Apple have the opportunity at this WWDC to bring macOS to iPad Pro M4 and make this device skyrocket in sales and have an actual meaningful use.<br>Make it something like DeX by Samsung but the Apple way. Have an icon that you can switch simultaneasly between iPadOS and macOS because the hardware is there, the only real work they have to do is to make macOS touchscreen friendly. We all know they have enough resources to do that, so if they don&#39;t, they are doing it on purpose! So two things I feel like weren&#39;t conveyed properly. First, iPad OS <b>is not</b> MacOS. You literally <b>cannot</b> do many things on the iPad that you could do with a full operating system. If you&#39;re locked in the Apple ecosystem and only need to use the few apps Apple provides for the iPad, then sure, it could replace a MacBook in that narrow use case.<br><br>Second thing is app developers generally treat tablet like the unwanted stepchild. The <b>worst</b> version of most apps shared between phone, tablet, or desktop will be the tablet version (assuming a tablet version even exists, often it will just be a badly stretched phone version). It&#39;s the smallest marketshare so the lowest priority to get right. at least u get 40  bucks off if u trade in ur m2 ipad LOOOOL 3600USD? Unreal insanity!

But you did not buy it, did you? TLDR: For clicks. Bold of you to think Apple will let you replace the macbook with a tablet. Goodluck with that. maybe by year 2060 The ipad power is overwhelming, the ipad system and apps are underwhelming. Ipads are good to consume videos, music, storing sheet music and take notes. My 2014 macbook pro from 2014 still beats any ipad for making music for me due to lack of support for vsts and AU like NI kontakt,EZ drummer and the pletora of effect plugs I have. For writing scientific papers an ipad is hopeless due to similar lack of apps supporting my field. This area is off course also dominated by microsoft programs and templates designed for those. I can still write those papers on a macbook pro from 2014 using the same software as efficent…… Damn only cost me 2500 usd in the USA for the 2 tb model Because you are a aron What was that 3D design software they were using? what is the game at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=435\">7:15</a> ? This review is quite different from MKBHD’s review, or rather view on iPads/tablets in general. 😮<br><br>I suspect Apple will merge the two systems together and have a macOS experience for work with mouse and trackpad connected and a tablet mode for entertainment/relax time. The cringe of super rich youtubers pretending to complain about price. &quot;We have an app for that&quot;. Sure and if it works on my old mobile phone it gets updated and will not. We run Windows 0S for around 10 years and programmes are likely to run on previous versions of Windows and the next version. Android and iOS apps get fixed to shorter update runs of Android. A device gets only one update, more on iPhones and then it is fixed. So having an app comes with &quot;how long will it be before I need to upgrade my phone?&quot; But that is not the only issue. The latest operating system might not allow an older app to run.  You app enabled device then needs an old phone to still use it. As much as it works for you which is great personally I am with MKBH more power, thinner, still not a labtop releasement yet.  Wishing you beautiful wedding. Why you spent that much? Ofcourse, for clout. I like that the thing is so expensive that the guy had to make a video talking about buying it before even receiving the actual thing, haha.

How much money do you get for this commercial?

For $3,600 - Macbook Air 15 inch full specs and still have some spare change left. Plus, Macbook Air battery still last much much longer than iPad. <br><br>I have iPhone 15 Pro Max, Macbook Air 15 full specs and Apple Watch Ultra 2..........why do you really need iPad? I&#39;ve never even owned an apple product and I find this interesting 😂 Samsung &gt; Apple The price is ludicrous. It&#39;s amazing how much you can con people just by good marketing. Of course Apple friendly YouTubers help Dear Apple, to answer the Question; What is a Computer? , Answer: It is an IPad which has Apples version of Samsung DEX featured in the OS😅. This is the answer I think you are still looking for, and I think will satisfy all iPad users.  I mean Samsung has it and the Microsoft surface has this same feature now. So what are you waiting for….?. Ow and if apple is able to pull this off, I think a lot of buyers will choose the iPad over the MacBook Air as their first device in the Ecosystem. Ow pricing….😅😅😅😅😅 what about m3 ? did it jumep over m3 or what? I HATE when a product tells me to use their app. Not everything needs an app. Most are completely unnecessary. &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4&quot;... &quot;because I&#39;m no smart guy&quot; While every other YouTuber is calling the new iPad for what it is - a joke - Arun here, an Apple fanboy, is coming in to rescue this obsolete brand from losing more sales than they already have. Objectively speaking Samsung tablets are way more useful and don&#39;t cost an arm and a leg. Aaron singlehandley funding the economy Are apples prices justified in the year 2024? Because of the hype, I did buy ipad pro 11 1st gen back in 2019, only to be used as a streaming device on my dining table when the family eats. 😂 I Wish That This new ipad pro Had Dynamic Island And it might be worth it Ithink the best thing to buy is the 999 11 inch one cuz if ur not a youtuber why do u need it☠️☠️ Boycott ipad M4😊👍 No matter how overpowered iPad is it is still limited by iPad OS. Until Apple brings in MacOS in it&#39;s iPad, I will stick with my 360 degrees revolving touchscreen laptop. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m gonna pay monthly subscriptions for APPS such as FCP, come on! Can&#39;t wait to play candy crush on this Got an IPAD pro in 2018 and replaced it with my hp laptop.<br>Using the same iPad till now<br>But seeing all these new stuff wants to make me buy the new iPad Pro Literally it’s just the files app man So… If you get a nano textured display, do you need a screen protector for it as well to prevent scratches?<br>Do you then get a normal finish or another matte finish? watched the whole video,... only to be left with iGLAD  :( why arun why :P 👈🏻”Bloodshed” is a great show that will feature major X Men soon Clash of clans 4K 1440P 400HZ 🔥 🗣️ The only reason smb can and buy things like this is flexin. That&#39;s it Why don&#39;t you review Huawei p 70 ultra and xiaomi 14 ultra ? Why I spent 3400$ on new iPad Pro M4?<br><br>A: Cause you’re an Apple fanboy and you’ve way too much idle money on your hands!! You should not think Apple uses currency exchange rate. 2800 pounds will be just 2800 euros in Europe and 2800 dollars in US. Fair? No. But that’s what it is. i&#39;m just waiting for jerry rig everything&#39;s video 💀🙏 I think is not worth the price of 2 MacBook Pro I don’t recommend you to buy MacBook and iPad you waste your money the reviews are fake laptop for use  is only windows   Much better in reality Macs are a pc replacement to use pc apps on the go. Ipad is just a bigger phone unless ipad runs macos This is why you don&#39;t have to take the opinion of apple fan boys seriously If any of you have noticed the background during the start to the end it changed from morning to night <br>What a long video!<br>Looks like Arun has spent the entire day just sitting in one position and explaining why is buying the iPad pro M4. Selling &quot;iPad like MacBook&quot; and &quot;Pen&quot; and &quot;smart keyboard&quot;, now why wouldn&#39;t you get this over MacBook.😂 Honestly, if it&#39;s most likely going to be use on a table anyway, why would the weight matter? Slimmer often means easier to break as well. Using an iPad Pro m1 as my secondary device for quite a few years, here what I miss from my Mac :<br>- using the full desktop Notion app (so I could open pages in side peek)<br>- using a full desktop web browser (Arc would be marvellous) =&gt; this would also solve my first issue<br>- using the full desktop Adobe suite.<br><br>For everything else, this m1 iPad is already very capable. Video editing is still better on the Mac obviously, and I would miss my AI auto cut plugins on Final Cut, but with a few software tweaks on iPadOS would help me be totally different in my usages.<br><br>I would trade my MacBook Pro for a Mac Studio, and use macOS only on my sitting main device.<br>My iPad would finally be the perfect secondary device, the one sufficient to do ALL the things I need to do on the go. No need for a MacBook anymore.<br><br>So it’s <b>that</b> close to be perfect but the software is not perfect. I hope to see the light during the WWDC It does not cost $3600 lol <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Rest in peace, Ipad now the tablet is officially dead. Isn&#39;t it just guitarists and kids who play with Ipads. Overall, I think the whole touchscreen hype is cooling off. When even the automakers start bringing back physical buttons, we know that the touch hysteria sings the final verse. Metal and glass slab to be held in one&#39;s hand ... I&#39;m also planning a video on this Apple knows that if they put any price tag, people will still buy it. Even if the product is actually worth 1/4th of its value. Biggest issue is it is still just IPad OS, not full IOS operating system...heavily restricted in any type of advanced functioning. I cannot use a PC where I am unable to do anything advanced that would be a piece of cake on Windows or Linux or IOS. Nope just let ppl install IOS on it (it has the power) and then it would be a game changer. At present its just a faster IPad, def not a game changer. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> yooooooooooooooooooooo You know what I like most about this video. <br><br>There was a visual passage of time.<br><br><br>That was cool. I have a iPad Pro (M1), and a iPad Mini, both have cellular, and I couldn&#39;t dream of having a tablet without it in the future. I am currently waiting for the next mini to be released, as I find I use my mini far more than the pro. Apple is actually trying to kill minis. Haven&#39;t you seen how they &quot;silently&quot; removed the ipod nanos and the iphone minis?<br><br>Yeah definetely they just dumped the mini versions of the ipads too<br><br>next thing you know they&#39;ll drop a backpack to keep all of that stuff that&#39;ll be like $1000 and wont even fit them if you wont buy a bigger $2000 version. <br><br>I just realised the monopoly that apple is.<br><br>Also probably, apple is just ditching EVERY device they can until they have an ultimate device that&#39;s just gonna be the single one. This feels like a social experiment more that a company being greedy.<br><br>Sorry for putting like every shower thought i had from this video. @@AlexMatracaru Sounds like you don&#39;t even know what a monopoly is. No one is forcing anyone to buy an apple product. No one is stopping you from buying a Samsung. A monopoly would be like where I live, my cable company is Spectrum. I am not allowed to get cable service from any other cable company. I either get Spectrum, or I don&#39;t get cable. Period. That&#39;s a monopoly. @@mikemccormick6128 so apparently you didn&#39;t read the whole thing and dont know that was just a random thought i didn&#39;t think of twice before posting @@mikemccormick6128 also you&#39;re a nerd I see that tablets not that important At this point apple should give the I pad macos Considering trading in my current ipad for this, really like the OLED screen as someone who uses the ipad for art Even if I would buy this iPad I don’t think it would replace my reMarkable. No tablet has the “paper feel” it has. Plus, it only does one thing really well, instead of a bunch of things that distract me from note taking. trying to justify $3600 for a pile of metal is crazy ❤ if i would have had that much money i would buy every apple product and try it out myself and not watch this video<br>but since i am broke i am quitting youtube to earn a better living and am not going to watch this video All ipads eventually become a Youtube and Netflix machine if you want to work on something go for a laptop What do you mean by car&#39;s worth of money?? what&#39;s the jumper he&#39;s wearing? Who knows, in the future you might be holding a Macbook while holding your baby 😁 Video feels like a child explaining to his parents why his Macbook is no longer sufficient and he now needs the latest iPad. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=435\">7:15</a> which game? Anyone? People even promoting these heavily nerfed MacBooks need an unsubscribe. Amazing video, as always! not sure how anyone can take this guy serious with videos like this. honestly i think its TOO thin. I would rather it be a bit thicker. Who would of thought that an iPad costs more than the Vision Pro „Full on computer“ but doesn’t have pro apps 🤡 I own a Macbook Pro M1 Pro but the price of this new tablet is just obscene. just adding to your click through rate to laugh at every buyer in the comments Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4 = answer cuz you are paid youtuber The only way I found that I can use an iPad successfully to replace my laptop is to stick to using Safari browser, Google apps do not work as well as their browser versions. For instance, this browser version of Safari allows me to export a single page from a spreadsheet as a PDF. This is not possible in the apps, also, if you are using a keyboard the shortcuts between cells do not work in the app but they do within the browser. <br><br>(I’ve uninstalled all of the apps except for Spotify. Running a iPad Pro with Logitech folio keyboard and trackpad) If anyone has ideas on an alternative method to keeping track of files instead of the default finder let me know. About the pen function , I think Samsung did few year before… If you can run it on MacOS- maybe.  On iPadOS no way.  It&#39;s a big phone unless it&#39;s on MacOS.  As a second screen for 14&quot; Macbook Pro- interesting. Hello, Humans <br>Find your path and make sure you walk down it. Don&#39;t allow any human to force you off such a path.<br><br>TERRANCE OUT Saying the iPad can do things better than a Mac is WILD. You&#39;re out of your god damn mind. I look forward to the &quot;oh shit I made a mistake&quot; video.... Hope we are gonna be invited to the wedding<br>After all you are still your family ❤️ So, what can he do on this new iPad that he couldn’t on the previous gen?  The hardware is amazing.  The software is way behind.  Put a decent OS on the damn things already.  This would make a great portable dev machine. funfact i am watching your video on ipad pro Yep but like you said it doesn’t have file manager and you cannot install any computer app you may need for school/university file manager is a thing for years now on ipad Please do a giveaway 😅 I can’t buy one. I think people are forgeting that the new generation kids are using tablets more then anything else. These products are hitting their consumers, only that&#39;s not us. You are losing touch dude. The price is ridiculous and you are defending not just an awful company, but justifying consumerism and garbage products. He biggest concern about iPad or IpadOS is: Often using a single performance core only, maybe max. two of them! Hope, this will gone change. Also background activity with attached power supply should be offered. I never ever had any usecase for a Laptop!😅 Using passive cooled PC or iPad pro. We will be surprised about Snapdragon X Elite SoC Performance in a few months! At that price It should be able to run MacOS so that I can do programming with it. And it can run MacOS easily Apple just don&#39;t want to enable it. This is a version of &#39;Boy Maths&#39; “When you’re watching stuff with blacks…” 😂😂😂😂😂😂 (I’m black by the way) Most powerful subway surfers machine All I do on my m1 iPad is browsing and watching YouTube. And I will keep doing it until it dies. Because it’s good and will remain good for it until it dies Go W vid bro good job Not convincing… m1 iPad still can do all of that. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=602\">10:02</a> That&#39;s the first time in my life I&#39;ve ever heard anyone say that. Next time he says:/<br>- you&#39;re asking me why I&#39;m buying a phone? Cause you know I&#39;m a tablet guy, I&#39;m a smart watch guy but never been a phone guy :-| Ipad = tech decoration i dont understand the proper use .. like neither i can make serious zoom calls (as i may need to share some urgent files), neither i can play fortnite, neother i can edit videos properly (for professional  use) , downloading asset, putting in files/ videos is too much time consuming... <br><br>like this has nothing to do with processor speed... this is downside of tabs as a whole. i own ipad and android tab both.. like .. mostly for casual task... its not usefull for professional use at all. sorry, but nobody cares about the thinness of a ipad, when they get a battery performence in the other case. Why is this guy speaking like Surface Pro never existed?! Because you are now a fanboy. ❤ Its nice if you are rich you can spend in useless things! None of what you are talking about is new to the latest iPad Pro - at least to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=569\">9:29</a>. Prepare to be disappointed - using an iPad with the Magic Keyboard is nothing at all like using a Mac, and very little of the difference is for the better. I went from an M1 12.9&quot; iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard to an M2 MacBook Air and it is way better. That was while I had (and still have) a 16&quot; M1 Max MacBook Pro. I have had an iPad mini 6 since it launched and I didn&#39;t miss the 12.9&quot; at all when I sold it. I am just about to buy an 11&quot; Pro to replace the mini 6 (for the tandem OLED display), but I won&#39;t be wasting money on a keyboard for it and I will be keeping my M2 Air and my M1 Max 16&quot; When you rich &amp; 18.5 Million subs, you can afford a 4K IPad. 😅 You are going to be massively disappointed if you are for real. I guess everyone&#39;s just gonna allow brushing your teeth like that to slide. when an ipad costs more than the vision pro Click bait, does not actually have it First world problems at its finest. ......coz you gonna make more money making the video with it. can anyone help me with the grey blouse/shirt he&#39;s wearing here? the company/type please? Are we all getting sent an invitation to the wedding?? Not worth the money IME. Macbook can do more and is better. Just 400k away from apple A super thin tablet device sounds so bad when you have someone like me with massive hands I still think that an iPad is absolutely not capable enough to be as good as a real MacBook, just going on safari, open multiple tab .. like open a YouTube video on safari while opening an other … you can’t, you can’t run 2 videos on safari at all, it paused it …. <br><br>App on iPad are good but very locked on what you have to do and you cannot move the needle from “it suppose to do that” to “let do more” like Final Cut .. it’s good but it’s stuck to what it supposed to do .. <br><br>I mean that they’re still things stuck on the fact that it’s still iPadOS … Adobe photoshop<br>Unity<br><br>These two apps can&#39;t find it on IPAD My ipad has completely replaces my tv. I can’t imagine not having a tablet. Man i really wanna order one of these lol just debating if the 1tb is worth it for the additional core Perfect for (rich) ipad kids With the current iPadOS there is nothing exciting about these iPads and they will still be terrible laptops replacements for most people. I&#39;ve tried many times to go iPad only, so I&#39;m completely on board with the idea, but in real life it&#39;s frustrating as hell. Mobile apps are much worse than desktop apps , take basic stuff like Google Docs or MS Office or Lightroom, it&#39;s just worse to use. Yes, editing photos on an iPad is nice and intuitive sometimes, but anyhting with file managment etc is a nightmare. No matter how much Apple spends in advertising through YouTubers to make the iPad feel like Macbook without making any core changing the outcome will be the same. iPad sucks. Apple to you want an advice free of charge? iPad and Macbook nowadays have the same chip so there is no point of making two products with the &quot;same&quot; specs but with different OSs.. and trying to make an iPad to feel like a laptop... Just create a MacBook with these beautiful chip you&#39;ve made, with a detachable keyboard and Mac OS installed and voilà. You have the perfect Laptop iPad and you stop putting so much effort on a laptop like iPad. how much did this guy get paid by apple? ….and why you shouldn’t. That should be the title The &quot;I can neither confirm nor deny...&quot; had me pause😂 Review ❌️ Ad ✅️.   Apple can consider fewer events now. For the storage question: you can have an external m.2 ssd bay, where you put any SSD you want in it. I have a 1TB drive with me like this, so you can easily have a 4TB with you at all times. And because its external, you can connect it with USBC cable to a phone as well I have the 12.9 m1… it really is just a big iPhone… lol I like apple products, but remember apple will do anything to grab you as app store user. They are deliberately slowing new website features and trying you to sell apple device because then they take 30% cut of everything Of course you did. டேப்லட்டே இல்லமாயே டேப்லட் பற்றிய காணொளியா இந்த குரளி வித்தைய நீயும்டா பண்ண ஆரம்பிச்சிடயா? you know what would be perfect? Ipad pro hardware, with the latest android software. The Pro can be great for Graphic Designers, Photo Editors, and Artists. But I do not see someone picking this one up instead of Air easily. It is much more expensive compared to an Air. The screen on the iPad Air is quite good actually. I think a Mac is better for gaming though. I never had problems with indie games. AAA games are extremely boring. The only good thing they have going on is graphics. Imagine spending $3600 on a tablet, only for drawing🥴 another YT video with fake screen image of a PS-ed ipa in handd.. lame Do not get the nano coating.. You will regret it... Cleaning it would be a pain and you&#39;re at risk of it getting scratched easily. Especially since it is a touch screen device. Tosser... thin → fine; fast, powerful → swift; big → great; normal → usual, plain; little bit: pick one; thick → coarse; performance → speed; computer → desktop; PC → Wintel, DT; doesn’t !→ they: 1 != 2 Honestly, imagine what that $3600 tablet <b>really</b> costs Apple for the parts &amp; labour. People aren&#39;t trying to kill themselves at Foxconn cos they&#39;re worried about making too much money, and the difficulty of choosing the best investment options! To make a video and get more revenue <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=520\">8:40</a> game name? Can&#39;t wait to see you edit your videos on the iPad So its not a Laptop? If the ipad is really worth it for your own work then its a win but dont buy tech that isnt useful. I bought ipad for a reason, i use procreate for art, note taking, good performance, 120Hz rate, music making/garageband. Thats why i have ipad, some buy samsung tablet cuz they have their own personal preference. Dont buy something to show off, thats literally a waste of money, buy if you think it will support u for future. “Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.” Cuz I’m rich and money ain’t sh*t and I’ll make 1000x the money back from this video 100 % TRUTH 1. Apple is such a money whore<br>2. Those huge bezels on an iPad Pro should be illegal<br>3. Apple ain’t ever been the same since Steve Jobs died, we need REAL innovation back which tablet has a smaller bezel and how is that more practical? Does that thing has fortnite ?🧐😢 To earn 36000 from the review video? It&#39;s so SAD to see the downfall of your videos.<br>Unpourposfull videos which are only made to cover some costs!

Too bad their internals are slowly dying away. Apple has yet to surpass their iPad Air 2 from 2014, form-factor-wise.<br>It&#39;s like these companies have been trying hard to put insanely powerful chips in more and more uncomfortable to hold (yet extremely instagramable) bodies. Are they making devices for social media instead of humans? Go to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=476\">7:56</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=479\">7:59</a> and look at the cameras. I think there is some photoshopping with the depth sensor. 😏😂 CAUGHT U ARUN. Watching this youtube video with a samsung tablet (galaxy tab S7) 🤓 iPads are undoubtedly very very capable devices and rather impressive pieces of tech BUT, your workflow in iPad OS is where things will be frustrating. <br>I&#39;m on the M1 iPad Pro and there is nothing I throw at it that it could not do well but I still finding myself wanting that efficiency of MacOS.<br><br>Hopefully that will drastically improve with iPadOS 18 later this year. It&#39;s nice , but I have zero interest in having a tablet in my life . Plus apple is a greedy company. I now can comfortably say that this time Apple has copied samsung.... It&#39;s more expensive than the 77in samsung s90c OLED TV What pullover are you wearing??? &lt;3 I still have the ipad 11 inch m1 chip and will never upgrade!!!! maybe ill do that when m5 or m6 chips will introduce! im happy with my ipad, always like thee pencil for art!!! and very useful for editing..... Ooohhh, i know why you spent 3600 on the new iPad! Because for every video, you make at least $30,000 per million views? Yea, that&#39;s probably why. Since you haven’t used an iPad in a while, I’m going to burst your bubble….sorry but you will miss your MacBook. As soon as you try to do things MacOS specific, and there are many of them, you’ll be reaching for that MacBook. Trust me, I’ve tried the last few versions of iPadOS and it just isn’t there yet. I love my iPad Pro but it is definitely a complement to my MacBook, not a replacement, no matter how lite and screen type the iPad is. I do have an iPad but recently just switched to mac as the ipad wasn&#39;t able to run unity and program web site. So you dindt buy it? Haha so apple&#39;s ipad is finally as good as a standard Samsung tablet.<br>cool. welcome to 2020 apple fans.<br>oh, and Samsung tablets have a great file system sitting here on my 4080 g14 that can do literately anything that cost £2500 i dont feel ripped off.. Android phones have had deep black acreens forever 😂😂 What do you do when you crack the screen Ipad could replace Macbook?<br><br>Day by Day, Arun is losing his credibility by becoming a Pro-Apple Fanboy. This guy has a lot to learn from MKBHD!!!!!!!! What a waste. Buying a new iPad Pro is equivalent to buying a Yugo 45 with a turbocharged V8 engine. <br><br>It&#39;s still just a Yugo and drives like shit. Just like an iPad Pro Omega Supreme is still just an oversized iPhone, I mean iPad. <br><br>And the cash grab with increasing the size marginally, just to make old keyboards obsolete and not making the new pen backwards compatible, it&#39;s disgusting. <br><br>Good job Apple, as expected, don&#39;t ever change. 🤦\\u200d♂️ On the next episode of jerryrig everything….iPad breaks when it’s in your backpack and you drop it 20 inches off the ground 🤣🤣🤣 3600!? Man buy a MacBook you’re ridiculous paying that much for an iPad with a new Magic Keyboard…dude you’re crazy Why are apple products so expensive?!?!?!<br>🤦\\u200d♂️ 3600?? rofl How relatable I&#39;m worried. If ipad becomes the main device over laptop or phone, then apple is just having monopoly. no other brand is even close when it comes to tablet improvements. So it&#39;s soo great for Apple to push the &quot; tablets are the best device&quot; narrative Pixel 8a review, please because you can, there is no why. The device is great for creative professionals like architects and VFX artists. It&#39;s also great for note-taking. All that power is essentially for rendering and multi-track playback. Beyond that, it&#39;s still a giant phone for Netflix and YouTube. For software engineers that <b>aren&#39;t</b> WebDevs, iPadOS still isn&#39;t adequate.<br><br>It&#39;s a great non-general-purpose computer for non-techie people. Whenever iPadOS allows access to system files (and not just a siloed-off section of memory that is the equivalent of an empty flash drive), allows for app downloads from third-party websites, allows for compiling of code LOCALLY and natively, along with allowing floating windowed apps vs. only allowing for tiling two to three apps at a time... Only then will it be worth a look for technical folks.<br><br>For the rest of us, we&#39;ll stick with MacBooks! 😄 i saw somewhere that ipads are nerfed macs. even with all that power, it&#39;s still just an ipad. you can&#39;t maximize the hardware because of the limitations of iPadOS. I think tablets are mostly bought by med students. We have apps that can only run in android or ios, so we can&#39;t really buy a pc or mac. But i gotta admit consuming content in a tablet is a whole different feel. But if you have an option, always go for PC. ARUN, WHERE DID YOU BUY THAT GREY SHIRT FROM PLEASE? Can any of you just be frank with me? Is Apple allowing the iPad mini to go extinct or what? So I have the Ipad 9 for Uni and never have I ever thoguht &quot;wow this needs more power than my pc&quot; Time to play PUBG on the M4 pro hahahaha.

The info should be told in the video. It&#39;s not an Apple ad, it&#39;s a kind of review and first look. But is it worth the price? Like Apple prices are just absurd I wonder if Apple is giving you money, you-tuber guys. It is only possible to compare iPad and Mac once or until all apps for which a laptop is used will be optimized for iPad. Even though all PC apps don&#39;t work on Macs yet, they daydream. For the price of one tablet you can get s pc with a 4090 and 7800x3d. Brah This iPad is more than 2x the price of my friends gaming pc with 3080Ti Did you also see the 11 inch one? If yes is there a difference in the display like the 12.9&quot; and the 11&quot; on the older iPad? Short answer “Because I have money” A few days ago I bought a Redmi Pad Se for €210 and compared to my old tablet which was around €110, I have to admit that the price really makes a difference, not always, of course, but in my case yes. Regarding this iPad, I think it&#39;s too expensive even though certainly better than most tablets on the market, but again I would never buy it, I think it&#39;s a waste of money. It’s such a waste not having 2 USBC slots and the ability to run normal apps. It’d be a MacBook Air with an amazing touchscreen. Isn&#39;t that foldable with that thickness I can neither confirm nor deny the location of this particular video… I&#39;d love to see a video from you on the Huawei Pura 70! You said the iPad can&#39;t do 100% what a macbook can, true, but also the mackbook cannot do 100% what an ipad can. So just as between iOS and Android , no one device can do it all. And still no multi-user on iPad. If you need to create a whole video just to convince yourself purchasing this ipad, then you’re not the public for the device. <br>Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great product for professional creatives (designers, illustrators, animators, etc), but a macbook is more oriented for other type of professional public (coders, etc.). In the end if you want it, go ahead and share your experience…. I want to convince myself it’s a good option.<br>Comment sent from an ipad pro 12.9 from 2018 😅😁 <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Z8MfY8mzLbnovwK5roC4Bg\"></a> The greatest youtube and netflix machine ever madeee.... This is a scam and you should be ashamed of yourself. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEE HERE. All this already existed in 2021 when I bought the M1 iPad. It can’t do anything a MacBook can do. Hell it doesn’t even have a calculator app. <br><br>This guy has been bought off I am curious, do you use the majority of the 8TB on your mac? I&#39;m very much a &quot;get the max options on everything&quot; kind of guy, but when purchasing my Macbook a year or so ago, I ended up limiting myself to only 1TB, and its been great and I&#39;m nowhere close to using it all. Obviously with content creation you will have a ton more files, hence me being curious about how much storage space is truly taken up out of the 8TB. big gigabytes How many of you got a Samsung ad before the start of this video🤣💀 Apple realised that samsung&#39;s s9 series were trending, so they wanted to be on the spotlight The answer to the vid title is: <br><br>So I could make a YouTube video about it, and get the money back instantly from views Me reading the title: &quot;You did WHAT&quot; The new M1 iPad Pros are great devices but the problem has always been the same since the first iPad Pro, the software. Like having the M4 chip which is capable of so much more than iOS can offer. That is why Apple should make the iPad Pro run MacOS so it can have way better apps to utilize its internal specs. Apple wont do this though because they dont want internal competition with the MacBook Air because the air would basically be pointless with the iPad keyboard and the iPad would still be a better deal. I&#39;ll buy a pc with this amount of money At this point over half the video is talking about it because he is too scared to buy it Imagine spending 4k on a tablet....wtf is wrong with people. I feel like there may be a slight increase in battery life for the new iPad Pro based on 2 factors that can be observed during the presentation. The M4 Chip powering the iPad is stated to have 50% more efficiency for a specific amount of power which might help when powering 2 OLED Panels at the same time depending on the workflows you are doing. I think it would be interesting to see a battery life comparison for the M2 and M4 iPads. You spend because doing a review is your job, so constantly you have to upgrade to incite users.,  From next time don&#39;t use such cheesy lines like why I spent this much on that😂 In an earlier video, you mentioned that you could not split screen on mac, this is actually possible by making it no longer full-screen and going to the window tab above They should have made the new pencil compatible with M1 ipads at least. I can finally induce headache with an ipad! the durability tests for this thing are going to be damning... I particularly love the explanation and the way you differentiated a MacBook and iPad, really wish I can get that iPad cos am a student, it gonna go a long way.<br><br>Thanks Mrwhosetheboss There are plenty of devices far cheaper with far more capabilities than the iPad. Honestly, if you&#39;re dead set on an iPad Pro , just buy an M1 iPad second-hand, even that is total overkill This M4 chip tab <br>Has NPU ? <br>of 16 core or more.<br>Because <br>M1 M2 M3 in laptop and in I Mac has 16 Core NPU<br><br>But in I pad of M1 M2 ,  I didn&#39;t know , that NPU is present or not ? <br><br>Please ans <br>And suggest I pad  with NPU Chip <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=601\">10:01</a> absolutely wild statement. I still much prefer not having to install an app. I really could not care less about the thickness. I have my eye on the M3 model now though. WWhen I saw the price, my soul slowly withered. Expense wise, it&#39;s getting right up there with the gaming laptop I want (ROG Asus Strix, pick whatever year cause they&#39;re all expensive). I&#39;ve also been on the fence about getting one at all when my old one still works (Lenovo Legion Y740 I think, forgot the numbers), it just has a terrible battery life and constantly gives static electric shock when you don&#39;t use it on a flat surface. Just seeing the numbers of the new iPad made me realize &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t need anything new when my old ones still work&quot;. You can&#39;t draw on a 1200 laptop most of the time So you pretty much bought an iPod that just happens to be wider and longer and happens to come with a stylus I use the iPad Mini for my flying. It holds my flight manuals, navigational charts and other essential documents, electronic flight bags. Who got Samsung Ads between this video 😂😂 Regarding your storage issue, instead of paying for icloud you could remote connect to a full pc over the ipad and have both a fully granular filesystem and also tons of storage which is expandle if it fills up. Then sync it up to a 95&#39;&#39; oled tv via the apple tv in 4K/8K, then it will be awesome! I hope you were able to convince yourself with your own video. It’s clear you know it’s not worth it at all. But hey, new toys! Dex laughing from the corner At this point you justifying your expense that u never needed It feels like this thin ipad looks very delicate and  might break &amp; also bend when it falls . <br>All money will be gone in one go. Bro why do you have 10 samsung adverts in a this short of a video 😮\\u200d💨 I am watching this in a iPad Pro 5 ( 12.9 inch) If the ipad was ever synced with macOS - it would be an easy, straightforward purchase for me. Even if it ran above two thousand. But if it remains only on iOs, then the mini does perfectly what i need. I feel like this one he was paid by Apple Overpriced. Sadly, the software is not there and never going to be until they make it a true computer Hmm! Think you got swept up by the Apple event, I&#39;d be very surprised if you don&#39;t end up returning this one. How much?... I disagree on the part about the apps working better on mobile. I am actually the complete opposite; if I am doing any extensive work I purposely make sure I work on a pc. Browsers I find work better on pc and I use a lot of engineering/coding apps like MATLAB which have a terrible mobile version. Even the YouTube app is bad, it feels like Google has made it significantly worse performing over the past year. Maybe it is different for creator apps like the photo editing you mentioned. Because your head isn&#39;t cooperating 😂 Just get a pc at this price Obscene is the right word. Replace your phone too brother  😅 With all that power, Apple still did not have courage to put MacOS on iPad. What a disgrace. Still no multi-window feature like Samsung? What kind of productivity is this?? Can I give suggestions for ipad software team? <br>-make a button on keyboard that can on/unlock screen without ever touch ipad if use keyboard<br>-make a software like totally same to powerpoint/word/pdf that can read and edit on it<br>-make gaming accessories for ipad (cause it can showoff its power right?) I know it’s click bait but bro it’s working and why!!!!? Bro paid a semester for it 😮 The cost of it equals to a normal pc please do drop test and bend test too🙂 Yea nah. iOS is so limited The issue remains with iPadOS - even with many improvements over the years you won&#39;t be happy with it in the long run - especially if you in ❤️ with Finder.... and if you need (for your job) a few desktop apps that are still very awkward to use (Excel, Horizon...). Is anybody here who&#39;s life majorly revolves around chrome extensions? Does it solve this problem? Perfect for me to use my boeing fleet app for aircraft maintenance engineering. Okay, this is cool, but when will they make a touchscreen MacBook Pro? What important is not thickness but functional.. in daily task.. 😂😂😂<br>Not like phone bring anywhere and anytime.. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=77\">1:17</a> I use my tablet for art. And we’re millions. I use my M2 12.9’ more than anything. I take it everywhere. My 15PM and M3 Ultra collect dust majority of the day. I do upgrade everything continuously lol No one will never see this. If you use any open source software, then ipadOS is a non-starter as a daily driver Why do I feel outdated with my iPad now 😅 He almost convinced me to buy new iPad until I checked my bank account Same lol 🤣😂🤣😂🤣👍🏽👌🏾 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Same😢 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Yeah, lack of money is the reason I don&#39;t get things too. Womp womp look for convertibles, this new device sounds like a convertible with apples phone os and thinner to me. Convertibles are laptops with a touchscreen where the keyboard can be flipped at the back or removed. The most famous convertible (not the best i think) is the Microsoft Surface series I didn&#39;t even need to check😔 😂😂😂 now stop it we cant be cruel to Bank Managers……actually dont think I have a bank manager its all online lol but until my iPad Pro goes belly up I am not parting with my overdraft for any brilliant pad ………..although I could just go to Apple Store and check it out I mean no harm in that is there??? 😂 @@aria_cyphersniff no that feeling . I think we are not alone a few billion of us at least @@xbelibigermensch3585i have an iPad Pro couple years old forget generation. But I got apple keyboard and love it. Funny thing is I dont seem to take it off keyboard lol which is odd because I always use to use iPad Pro I had before this one as a proper tablet . Me 2😂 same，And I don&#39;t have a job now I&#39;ll stick to my Motorola g70 tablet for now 😂 😂😂😂😂😂 Where&#39;s your sweatshirt from? Why don’t these guys get the actual device and then do the review ! He will do another one when he gets one , yet the thumbnail shows that he has one ! nice review you are right, better than markybrown, maybe time to swith to ipad os, but whiners will whine Tablets😮 Random question, but what was the photoediting app he was using? Is it Pixelmator? Same arguement can be said for smart watch, why use a smart watch when a phone can do almost everything smart watch can do minus the heart rate monitor The most expensive YouTube player I am assured now that tv companies will utilise the dual led screen tech to make new tvs panels. I&#39;m so confused. Everything you mentioned about the new iPads replacing your laptop, the old ones can do ALL the same things except the Pencil Pro, which still is a very niche market compared to standard Apple Pencil (2nd gen) users. <br><br>I don&#39;t get why the M1/M2 iPad couldn&#39;t replace your computer given they function the same (because of the limited non-computer style iOS); meaning it still isn&#39;t a MacBook in any way, still much lighter than your MacBook, and have ZERO difference in performance when you didn&#39;t talk about gaming in your day-to-day lifestyle. The old iPads also never got hot either. That issue was solved when iPad went to &quot;M&quot; chips.<br><br>Truthfully, it just sound like you&#39;re just catching on late, because you didn&#39;t give the previous &quot;M&quot; series a real world chance. These new models are not worth it when you can get an M1/M2 for much less; especially after release of these new iPads.<br><br>End of story. So much power and no designated calculator app, this has to be some kind of inside joke ipad will never replace a laptop . I can move files from my a android phone to my pc The average person does not need that ipad 😅 For that money they better give me mac os and iPad OS iPad Air went from M1 to M2. iPad Pro went from M2 to M4. That is why they were comparing M4 to M2. M3 was skipped over completely for the iPad To be fair M4 chip without 3.5mm jack is still useless for video editing if you&#39;re not an artist or a graphic designer or a massive couch potato, then iPad is the worst device to buy even after coming 10years.<br>Tell me a thing that your iPad can do but not not iPhone, iPad = big iPhone. And this is coming from a former iPad pro user, and I absolutely hated it, its not about hardware its about software limitation. This makes no sense, why when there’s a spec bump (that literally doesn’t matter because it’s already too fast for its software) and it’s just a little bit thinner can it replace your laptop. It’s the same tablet as the year before and the year before that im still waiting to get a new ipad 9th gen for the first time I have had an ipad with cellular service since 2018 and have never regretted it. I have very little issues with connectivity even when going to another country as long as I make the proper plans for the service. I have plenty of video and files stored on the tablet so dead areas never cause me any more than a minor inconvenience. I will say that unfortunately I have had to get used to carrying a messenger bag for the ipad and accessories which does include back up storage. I find it convenient enough and carry it around everywhere. I even use my 12.9 inch iPad for the grocery stores app while shopping. 3600 to watch netflix. OOF That screen buzzle is disgusting Missing cores on lower tier ram options is just deceptive. <br>Should only be one version of the M4. I think we gotta wait to see if iPadOS 18 will take advantage of all this new “power” Swapping my 15 inch M2 MacBook Air 16gb for the 13 inch M4 iPad Pro and keyboard. My photography business runs on a dual monitor Mac Studio setup (with all the speed and screen real estate I need). The iPad will be far more versatile for my mobile and entertainment needs. Welcome to the Dark Side. 😂<br>I live in the Apple ecosphere, happily. <br>Apple IIe owner, even. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=258\">4:18</a> hello apple users samsung DEX exists Why they don&#39;t give anti reflective coting when  they have the technology Is this video sponsored because i couldn&#39;t get the genuinity that arun presents in the this videos Why you got the newest iPad??<br>-“YouTube, Safari and Occasional sketching” Can we open two excel sheets at the same time 😅 can you get me a ds Sooooo....the iPad is just a hobby machine. <br><br>As an architect it amazes me how Apple boasts about being designer friendly while having NO DAMN APP OR PROGRAM that we use work well with their environment.<br><br>But sure, let&#39;s drop $3,600 on a tablet that doesn&#39;t do anything a $1,000 laptop could do. Also, you&#39;ve been talking a lot about the keyboard and the pencil, how much more are those worth? Surely for the exact experience you&#39;re talking about, $3600 falls waaaaaay too short of a price. You didn&#39;t spend, you invested in creating a video on YouTube and then made more money.... Not like your subscribers that will really spend a lot of money for nothing 😂 I will never understand why people let Apple get away with a $1,000 up charge for just 2TB of storage. I hate being forced to install an app. Websites on pc can home a lot more information. Who is there waiting for new version of iPad Mini with new chip and OLED screen? tell me why For me the iPad Pro 2018 is still a great device - specs aren’t as good as this but they are still good enough for many actual users of tablets I use cheap Moto phones and old Dell quad core biz desktops that I get for $60, add a $20 SSD and install Zorin. I design stuff on a pad of graph paper with a pencil. I feel fulfilled. If you gave me a billion dollars, I would not change anything. Overpriced, overhyped piece of E-WASTE. Come on man iPadOS is so limited compared to macOS. It’s literally no comparison at the moment. Not sure how anyone can consider it as a replacement. Free Palestine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=577\">9:37</a><br>He is dancing. Without vaccines. I just wish samsung would make a magic keyboard for their tab ultra line. I’d never even look at an ipad again. The galaxy tab includes the pen, is cheaper, is water resistant, has SD card support, and that 14 inch display is SO much better. Is it waterproof?.. bro bought a $3,600 ipad, and he has many, MANY! exclusive phones, like a $1000 worth of subscriptions, fully maxed out computers, like every phone, the apple vision pro, every macbook, every playstation, nintendo and xbox console and handheld, and bro still has money! dang he must have robbed richie rich Angry birds in oled! Why did you spend $3600 on a iPad? Because you wanted to make a YouTube video and get that cash money duh Umm lol because you have done amazingly well for yourself and can afford to buy one ! Good for you .thats 2 months rent for my 2 bedroom lol .thanx for sharing the experience tho...my daughter wants one lol as if you can use the m4 chip Because HES  RICH… apple makes loser products for losers lol sent from my iPhone Only one reason: you can afford it. Some laptops can have cellular service! Not saying you shouldn&#39;t get one... I have a pro 12.9 from a couple years ago. I mainly use it for CODM. In the US, without accessories, you can spec the Pro 13inch, 2tb, wifi plus cellular, nano texture glass to $2599. I would have ordered the nano textured glass, but I couldn&#39;t stomach the extra $700. I don&#39;t need an extra core or 744GB more storage. I felt like I was way overpaying as it was. $1,883.62 including tax, Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil. Maybe I should have bought the Air instead of the Pro but I made my decision and I&#39;m sticking to it. Veri nice video from Bangladesh watching boss&#39;s videos on 4x speed cuz i got no time but wanna hear the in depth reviews Seriously, I’m all for increasingly better tablets!  I spend most of my time on my tablet, reading news, playing casual games, watching youtube/movies, displaying recipes in my kitchen, working from “anywhere”, etc!  Phones are great, but the screen real estate of a tablet is 10 fold better!  I continuously want a very powerful, responsive, stable tablet so I can continue to do these things with modern content and data speeds without getting frustrated and waiting for “processing to happen”.  Sure, I spend a lot of time on my laptop because it has 2 additional monitors and I can do more work at once when that’s necessary.  I also have my PC for epic fun gaming when I have the time.  But between work and gaming, I’m more on my iPad than any other device for the day to day tasks.  So I say keep’em coming! ^.^<br><br>Edit: ok $3600 is a bit steep, but I would have no issue paying that because I’m confident that will last me through the next decade.  So $3600 for a device that is gonna last as long as that is totally worth it IMHO.  I spent over $5000 on my gaming PC, and I don’t expect that to last more than 3 years before it starts to suck… let&#39;s admit it, iPad Pro is basically overkill in every aspect while apple is limiting its capabilities/iPadOS to stop it from killing the macbook&#39;s market Mmm a 16 minuts 11 second apple advertisement. As to why? Because you can.. And like another person has said: your a tech reviewer, and can afford it. To me its &#39;just a nerfed macbook&#39;. sitting in a coffee shop to sketch something isn&#39;t a thing. Wanting a drawing pad,however, is one. I still think the samsung galaxy tab s9 ultra is the best, I ain&#39;t buying apple That is ridiculous, to spend the price of a used car, on a tablet Most positive vid in the iPad stuff… but it also sounds like you’re new to iPads/only tried a demo of it.

Those are the exact same questions that I’m thinking about at the current time as to whether to update my iPad Pro, which I just purchased in December of last year. But I am going to be doing more YouTube videos And editing possibly. Right now I edit on my windows desktop computer computer. I’m also concerned about the battery life. I get so frustrated sometimes when my battery goes down to like 3% I plug it in for the night and when I come back in the morning, about six or seven hours later it’s not 100% and I’ve been working with the Support team to remove a whole bunch of stuff that I don’t need in order to get a better, longer battery life. And you’re absolutely right why would I need one or 2 TB when I can plug-in, something to have that. I still have a lot of questions. I have cellular on my current iPad. But it doesn’t let me do much. I just can’t answer her phone call if it comes in and my cell phone, which is an iPhone 15 Pro, isn’t by my side. you did answer one question that I had was whether my external magic keyboard works on the new one. I prefer the external one because then I don’t always have to carry it. Well again, or questions. Until I get answers, I’m not going to order a new one. $3600! I think that’s worth more than my car. Chuckling. how does that conversion even ake sense i thought the dollar was equal to a pound now This is the dumbest line up, I WANT ONE!!!! dammm bro 256 gb is enough for me with some 4k video editings but how can you use 8tb of storage and get it full cause you have it? That’s a cool shirt Answer he’s rich Still no calculator 😂 use a thunderbolt SSD for storage, I have a Sabrent Rocket for my Ipad its great, i have a bit of velcro tape on the ipad case and on the ssd to take it on and off and i also have velcro on my desktop and my laptops for when i move the SSD between the 3 devices Nope, I&#39;ve seen this scene before with Apple. Them making a thin device = bendgate 2.0 I wonder how many people even end up using its full power.😂 Need to sell my kidney to buy 😅😅 &quot;my Massive laptop&quot;. Dude. That&#39;s a thin and light laptop. This video is an excuse for a tax write off 😆 Go a Lenovo Yoga tablet,,it&#39;s got a built in handle.. and  dont have to deal with. Apple... Puns are definitely getting worse Your next video should be I bought every Sega console I wanted 15 inch iPads. Question: Would the nano-screen act more paper-like for the pencil as opposed to the glossy screen? I bought the Air 5 just the moment it came out back in 2022 and now im here contemplating if i should sell it and get the new ipad pro 2024. The new pro an amazing piece of tech but i know im only going to be using it for watching movies and writing documents 😅 $FINDME A KOI It&#39;s probably good to read a book on, with its double display and all. It&#39;s much easier to replace a phone with a foldable. That&#39;s why conscious consumers like us have a z fold 4. Imagine buying apple products intentionally though...😅 I usually really like your videos, but this one feels vey much like clickbait, a deadly sin for any serious content creator. 99% of users do not need a configuration that will cost $3,600. You might want that configuration ,but most people do not. I wish you trusted that your content was relevant (because it is) without needing to resort to tactics that really jeopardize a creator’s credibility. I believe you are better than that. The pen only work for newest ipad version😂😂😂 Dont call it computer, It does not support docker I can’t wait to see this in the background next to his Mac Pro Yeah, you know what else is $3500 the Apple Vision Pro are you gonna say pay the same price for an Apple Vision Pro as you  would on an  iPad. nah, this aint it. $3600 on a device that gets replaced by my computer. Hell, if i wanted a phone + computer, id get an s24 ultra...which has Samsung dex, or id get a phone and a good computer. This really doesn&#39;t seem loke a smart purchase at all We live in a world where apple charges 400€ for a keyboard and trackpad.<br>I don’t think I even want to know the profit margin on that As an architect, this iPad has been very useful. Having a full 3D model of an office park in your hand is amazing during construction. You got this already?? Don&#39;t confuse iPad and Vision Pro. the M1 iPad does everything you would need as an architect, even an iPad air would do great @@jokered1133 He obviously misspoke. The M4 iPad Pro has not been released yet. It goes on sale May 15. My Cellular M1 iPad Pro has been my favourite purchase for years now id definitely recommend cellular for those who travel. I think an M4 Pro is in my future. It would be perfect if it can run MacOS but of course Apple wont do that because it will cannibalize Macbook sales and also MacOS is not designed to be touch-friendly. Maybe give it a &quot;Dex&quot; mode? Bought the remarkable tablet to replace paper notebooks. Nothing more, nothing less. Don’t have a laptop, use the iPad Pro M2. Won’t buy the M4 iPad Pro. Not worth the upgrade. The Samsung Galaxy Tab9 Ultra does all of that and has DEX The thing about iPads for me is that, sure, they’re excellent hardware and I love their form factor - but their operating system is so limited. Once I switched from iPhone to Android and my phone and tablet no longer talked properly, it felt like all I had left was essentially a very pretty chromebook with a touchscreen. All the power of an M1 chip, but nothing I do on it feels any faster than it does on a Snapdragon.<br><br>There were a few key features that kept it from being a true laptop replacement for me - things I needed to do that simply were not on the App Store, and because of no sideloading, I couldn’t do them. Points where due, it was my favorite way to do the things I did on my phone up until the moment half of them became impossible for me to do on an Apple-branded tablet, and my only regret was that I spent $900 on a 256gb Air 5 and accessories when I could’ve been happy spending $600 on a 64gb iPad 10 and lower end accessories - but it loses a lot of points for becoming a really nice paperweight the moment the ecosystem disappeared from around it.<br><br>Anyway, I just ordered a Tab S8 Ultra refurbished for $470 to hopefully recapture what the iPad did, as well as what I hoped it would do - be better at doing things I did on my phone when I have it with me, and also do all the things I do on a laptop (every Windows productivity tool I use is available on Android either natively or with a workaround). Bruh, what a pain in the ahh when someone bends it by accident 💀 LOLS...better buy PC than this crap device. we can buy tablet way cheaper than this but also powerful for daily use. This is too much from apple. Crazy but nothing is special on this device lols. be wise on spending... Can&#39;t install macOS on it......... What a piece of <b>**</b> it&#39;s definitely not worth $3,600 just because of that single fact Hopefully with iPad OS18 this new iPad will be more functional. Highest end and still cant run MacOS or proper desktop OS 😂 bmw m4?? was waiting for your iPad Pro (2024) review to hear your take on it. Already seen MKBHDs take. i feel you both have two different prospective. same mofos buyin new phones and $3.5k tablets every year are the same people complaining about a $500 game console First of all, you have Money. 8T, Arun? Before even watching this video, let’s be real about your thumbnail. “Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4”. You did it because you’re privileged enough to where that kind of money is not an issue to you whatsoever, because it’s a business write off, a clickbaity and engaging title for a new video, and because your line of work pays disproportionally high vs the vast majority of others who put in the same hours into different careers. Movies on ipad pro sucks because aspect ratio means it&#39;s mildly bigger than iPhone max for the size of a macbook air. Bla bla bla you are a macbook guy, eventually you will make a video later “why I decided to ditch m4 ipad pro” - 3600$ L Bro that toothbrush was sus af BRO ONG 🤣🤣 - Brody set himself up - on his knees and all. 💀 Dude&#39;s making the same mistakes we all made in 2018.  Queue the video on two months where he finds out he loves the iPad but apple won&#39;t let him do any of the things he needs to do about it that with all on the Mac but the Mac isn&#39;t as fun as the iPad so he&#39;s going back to his Mac. 😅 The next Mac Convention WW- whatever (don’t know the name) will be decisive. <br>Either very good comes for the future of iPad - or … you’re right thats so true not if altstore and other apps are coming to ipad os @@gaberil Altstore?

I still have and use my 2018 iPad Pro 11” daily and it’s incredible. It’s basically just a media device for me tbh, but I do really want to get this new iPad Pro man. I love how thin and light it is. I remember the iPad Air 2 was also under a pound back in 2014 and it was awesome. Its still just an Ipad.... I&#39;ve tried three times to move from my air to my ipad pro, but every time I run into the same problem: Lack of desktop class apps, walled in ios garden, Issues with websites that refuse to treat it like anything but a &quot;phone&quot; accessing it. Watched the entire video. Still not convinced to buy. I mean, apart from calling it the most expensive book or digital art device, what else can you do with it? Im completely fine with my book, pen and sketchbook thank you very much (coming from a person who owns 6 expensive devices, so its not about the money) Also, NO TABLET should cost that much, at that point Apple is too damn greedy asking consumers for over 2 grand US for a tablet A subtle mrwhosetheboss thumbnail i never thought i&#39;d soo the day Can&#39;t tell if he was watching gameplay or ACTUALLY playing ZZZ, but if it&#39;s what I think it is, then he sure is damn lucky Paid review Apple sucks, brainwashed their customers for less but pay the same Make you iGlad lol I love this.

Thinner and rest all the shit is same..  Oops almost forgot We named CPU &#39;M4&#39; for no Reason,  Also for a touch of Sweet and Sour we also changed the  display name as Tamarind OLED.  Sorry Tandem (technically dumb) OLED😂  With this Renaming Briilance, Apple is now PineApplee🤣🤣🤣 This is the best bullshit review ive ever heard from him ipad pro m1 13…here… and no… ipados not a laptop replacement yet. and usb2hdmi dongle hanging hurts my OCD…. keyboard &amp; pencil doesn’t go well sometimes… I’ll wait more to upgrade Even though he is hyping this up, it’s not computer. No matter how much he tries to say “it’s amazing!” It still just a tablet. Then you want to copy a file somewhere. You&#39;ll find it still sucks on an iPad, not matter how fast and how light and how thin the new shiny thing is. Or try copying or moving a photo [or video] from an Android phone to an iPad; like copying a video clip to edit on an iPad in LumaFusion. 👎🏻No matter how highly you praise an iPad, its limitations are clear. Without full-featured Microsoft apps and a robust internet browser, it falls short for many users. Let&#39;s hope future updates address these gaps and unlock the iPad&#39;s full potential!

If you can’t dock this and have it become a Mac, I see no point. Bro got too comfortable with that toothbrush laughed a little when i heard the “iglad” joke 🤣 My circle wonder why i enjoy apple ecosystem.

Almost everybody who has a career that is not content creation and requires a laptop will not be able to replace it with any iPad. The iPad is purposely designed to just be right on the edge to be able to replace a laptop, enough so that you think it will and you buy it but you still also end up buying a laptop anyways. Trust me guys the tab s9 is superior and more fun to use.  One of the best I&#39;ve owned . It comes w s pen in box , is water proof, <br>has micro SD card,  has open operating system etc.  Also apple got that apple pencil idea from Samsung Because you are not smart. if this thing had what the samsung tablets had, and mac app support, then id be worth it at this level of thin, it has to have some kind of endoskeleton. or else it will be bent within a week. you are a pro video editor, how can you be considering replacing a real computer It feels like Apple is really trying to stall as long as they can before finally just making a touch screen MacBook. How long til they make an iPad with a pro level processor, and a sturdy enough keyboard with ports that can just merge the two products? It would be an absolutely amazing, single device. Hmmm. I&#39;ll keep my Amazon HD Tablet. 99 bucks. Perfect. Ipad has a light version of Microsoft office that&#39;s sucks... can&#39;t do VBA can&#39;t have all excel normal function to work like a pro....

Big PC Houses to Desktop PC to Laptops to Ipads. smaler Bro I’m telling this was a bad decision iPads have indeed made significant strides as laptop replacements, and for many, they serve that purpose well. Yet, personally, nothing quite compares to the reliability of a MacBook, with its sturdy hinge and the convenience of an operating system meticulously designed for seamless mouse and keyboard interaction. While the distinction between the two is narrowing, at the moment an iPad is still an iPad for me. i feel him turning into mumbo jumbo NOPE. I guess I’m done with Apple. Why the need to go thinner and thinner. I&#39;d prefer a bit thicker than the last model, leading to a heck more battery life. I have an explanation: stupidity But does it run Fusion the audio sounds bad Give us Mac OS on iPad and I’m in Wow you finally get your first touch screen Mac as an iPad 😂 what a surprise that Apple it’s pushing the iPad as replacement, shocking 😮 Cause you&#39;re not very smart Nice, nice...Can I have ur MacBook anyways? <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a>Most powerful Youtube and Netflix machine. <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a> Bro trying to get featured on the next Apple keynote 😅 I also ordered the maxed spec&#39;d iPad Pro 13&quot;. I hope I don&#39;t regret ordering the nano textured glass option. 🤔 The maximum price I can get one of them to be in the USA Apple Store is US$2,599. I realize that the UK price, converted to US$ is much higher than that, but the title is somewhat misleading. IMO, better to just list the UK price in £ instead. All of this is just a cute spec bump unless iPad OS is updated like it should be this year. Otherwise  unless you have money to burn just buy a used iPad I can’t wait to see Jerryrigeverything fold this in half like a piece of paper Sorry, I&#39;m not spending top shelf desktop money on a tablet. Period. That&#39;s a 4080 almost 4090 perbuilt turf. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the”justification” section of a successful direct marketing campaign; he’s been won over by the device on an emotional level, he’s now sure he wants to make the purchase, but he needs to justify it to himself first by saying “it has great specs, it’s so powerful, it could solve this problem for me, or make that task easier” etc. And when he’s thoroughly convinced himself, he’ll hit “buy”. Apple’s marketing wins again! But in all seriousness this new iPad Pro is a very impressive piece of tech. Especially for those who use their iPads for art purposes. Hope you don’t stress too much 🙄 Why not to make 14.6 inch tablet? @mrwhosetheboss I’m sure they will release at WWDC a software feature that will allow iPad Pro to operate as macOS when docked to the Smart Keyboard.

The screen on it&#39;s own makes we want to upgrade from my old basic iPad just for my super basic iPad use cases. I&#39;m gonna have to disagree on the software front. The locked-down nature of iPadOS is the biggest weakness of the iPad Pro. You did mention the file management, which is huge. On my Android, I use a third party file manager that works super well and is feature rich. Additionally, apps can have access to the file system directly, which is critical for local music players. In terms of games, you need to pay a subscription for most good games. This applies to most software as well, and I really hate renting software. On Mac, and especially Windows and Linux, there is a treasure trove of great free (as in beer AND as in freedom!) software that is focused on the user rather than emptying your wallet. $3,600 😮 Apple don&#39;t actually make their own screens, it&#39;s probably made by Samsung You made several rather strange,  subjective and misinformed comments. Just had to voice this. The fact apple called the new  apple pencil. &quot;Apple pencil &quot;pro&quot;. It&#39;s basically apple pencil 3rd generation I might be missing something but I have kind of been using an tablet like this since 2015.

Not replacing a MacBook as long as iPad OS remains what it is. most expensive ipads... yet Let&#39;s burn money for fun. For me I think WWDC is going to decide if I  get this new one or not. The M2 is more then capable enough. I didn&#39;t see anything during the keynote at least for my  use case that appealed to me. My iPad has pretty much replaced my  need for a laptop. I have a Windows desktop if I need to do some  serious heavy lifting, and my iPad handles everything else. I use DaVinci Resolve and it handles find on my iPad for my needs. My photo work is all done via Darkroom  and  now Lightroom (Capture One was a dumpster fire at launch and I haven&#39;t looked back at it).  Honestly I was really skeptical at first, but the iPad has become my favorite Apple thing. It’s good for reading Nope, iPadOs is different from MacOs. It won&#39;t feel like a MacBook, until developers of the app make it so. Event using canva is different on ipad, better on macbook 😢<br><br>The advantage point of this ipad is, you&#39;ll get a bigger, lighter extra screen for your MacBook From being a big phone to a small laptop, tablets have come a long way They should just add MacOS as a boot feature on the ipad $3600 for half of the performance and less capabilities of an already pricey MacBook. I&#39;ve never seen a video of you that felt like grasping for straws like this one. This really felt like an ad, but i know it isn&#39;t. However, i&#39;m happy you found a product you&#39;re excited about. Pricer than Vision Pro I didn&#39;t see it that way, I saw it as he finally found a tablet that actually fits in his life.

He doesn&#39;t know what he is talking about. The M4 iPad Pro has higher performance than any MacBook because no MacBook has an M4 yet. All that power to run a mobile OS. Why Apple are still subjecting its hardware to this easy work is beyond me....why aren&#39;t iPads running MacOS? If they&#39;re as powerful as Apple say, then it should be easy. Shut up apple and take ma money More expensive, worse battery life, removed a camera, cant use old accessories... With this amount you can buy an iphone 15, macbook and airpods.  You cant replace laptops or pc it is fhat simple. Yes phones are getting better and tablets but the main gadget for work remains the laptop or pc. You can get the latest inter core ultra or any sort of amd cpu either threadripper or ryzen, 4080 or 4090 and it will be undeniably better. I like the fact that you don&#39;t have an iphone. Don&#39;t get sucked into their closed off ecosystem. Because you are a youtuber and you do reviews Brah that tooth brush scene was suspect lol Uh you literally have a vid on this channel from only a few years ago about how the previous iPad model is so amazing and efficient and is invaluable to you at work, and now you&#39;re suddenly &quot;not a tablet guy&quot; and the thought of buying a tablet is weird to you? The price is way too much, in the current economic environment, you have all the tech and too much money at your disposal to judge these things accurately, apple need badly calling out for their walled garden practices, user freedom impingement, lack of control over their own data within the apple ecosystem, and you have a responsibility to do this on behalf of consumers. As you deleted my comment <br>I will be unsubscribing Why did you delete my comment? <br>About can&#39;t wait until you drop it what things in videos that you have reviewed as random/ cheap tech but actually use daily or often!!! @Mrwhosetheboss I wouldn’t buy Apple just wait the price would come down Apple is a greedy company Apple is trying to copy Samsung DeX which is far better experience even with a Samsung phone.<br>People will still buy this for status and not functionality. How the hell is this more expensive than the AVP? I’m watching this knowing I will never have anything expensive $3600? Foolishness... so true you are spitting straight facts mkbhd A 16 mins video just to justify himself in his mind why he wants to spend that amount of money. It&#39;s cos you can afford, due to the hard work you put in over the years. And that&#39;s awesome, and well deserved, 100%!! 😎🙌👊<br><br>Buttttt, on the flip side no one working regular jobs can justify this at all. Nothing is moving me away from Linux! I know that’s what I thought while watching (about the battery life) iPad already looks bent in the thumbnail 😭 As a medical student who replaced my laptop with an iPad (m2) permanently, I do have some serious takes on this. Just as advise. The new iPad pro’s and the old ones have the hardware of a laptop, which is incredible, but there is no way to utilise it properly, since there is not a single app on the iPad available that pushes the CPU and GPU to its max. Besides that, all the apps on the iPad are the phone versions, except for the webbrowsers. Which for me as a student is a huge disadvantage. I miss so many functions in apps like word and excel which are programs I have to use on a day to day basis. With projects I hit a wall very quick because I don’t have all the features you would have on a desktop. And the availability of apps is far more limited on the iPad than on a MacBook or windows laptop. This could be fixed if apple enabled side loading on the iPad, but they already made clear this will likely never happen. I need so many programs for school that the App Store just doesn’t support. It really is a dealbreaker sometimes. I do love the iPad for note taking and studying though. I am much more productive when it comes to studying than I would be if I had a laptop. Goodnotes is a goated app which is my entire file explorer/note taking place. It is so easy so write things down and make incredibly visual summaries. It works so smooth too and I can get a lot more out of studying this way. <br><br>Also I have the Logitech combo touch, and not the Magic Keyboard. And there are 3 key features that make the Logitech case superior for me than the Magic Keyboard. Firstly, the Logitech case offers way more protection, which you would want if you carry a tablet of 1200 euro’s around. Secondly, the keys on the Logitech keyboard are lighter, which I find more pleasant to type on. On days where I have to type a lot, I wouldn’t want my fingers to get tired of the typing. And lastly, you can detach the keyboard from the case magnetically which is SUCH A HANDY feature. I can’t address this enough. You can just snap the keyboard of just like that, while maintaining the protection of the case mostly and you get the kickstand with it. That is so useful. No keyboard in the way and a kickstand. There are countless times where I just snap the keyboard off to showcase something really quick to a classmate or to watch a movie without a keyboard in the way. I do believe that because of that feature it maintains the ‘tablet vibe’ of the combination. If you have your tablet in a keyboard case all day long it is surprisingly easy to forget that it is a tablet and not a desktop. Being able to remove the keyboard just makes it easy to switch to ‘tablet mode’ to put it like that. Also the Logitech keyboard is a lot cheaper.<br><br>I do think that a keyboard case on the iPad is tricky. The Magic Keyboard really makes you believe your iPad is a laptop. Which ofcourse can do similar tasks, but it is easy to forget that touch screen controls will ALWAYS be superior than controlling the iPad via a keyboard and trackpad. That is what a tablet is designed for. The trackpad is very useful, I can’t deny that, but there are plenty of times where I just snap the iPad from the keyboard and use it as a tablet because it is just easier and makes the experience actually more fun. <br><br>The passthrough charging on the case doesn’t really matter to me. I carry an adapter with me at all times, because I need to connect my iPad to an external drive or a monitor quite frequently. The adapter that I have also has a slot for charging the iPad while the adapter is plugged in, so I wouldn’t get much use out of the passthrough charging.<br><br>Be careful with replacing your desktops with an iPad people. It has serious advantages, but also disadvantages that don’t get adressed enough. An iPad is ofcourse very useful and cool, but I think in most cases you would be better off with a laptop. Yet another overpriced piece of crap, which maybe houses some horsepower, but will not be used for anything worth it. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=602\">10:02</a> No, I don’t prefer to download an app for every website/restaurant I visit. Jesus, this is the complete opposite of what I want. Does it have a calculator? Bc ur rich and it’s tax deductible Meh it&#39;s expensive,,,too expensive The video does not make a convincing argument to justify the price. Yes it’s powerful, but almost no apps that utilize that power. Bro, rip remarkable. Oh my guy. You really got me thinking. I was gonna, then after keynote, naw. Now, Hmmmm. Why does it say 3600,<br>It said 4000$ before how much did you spend Looks amazing, I&#39;m the opposite of App first, maybe more than that? On my new MBP M3 Pro, I try to install with brew as much as I can. I&#39;m still eyeing these things though. 😉 another 3600$ paid promotion But it still doesn’t have a built in calculator, right? I hate the title of this video lmao. We get it you got money. Fr The quality of your sweatshirts are insane!!!! Come put me on!! The M1 iPad and Magic Keyboard gives pretty much the same experience. Not sure why people would pay this much for a marginally better experience. Go figure. LOL<br>dude there no way this ipad can do 50% of what your mac book pro can do. sounds like you dpnt utilize your  laptop more then wedbrowsing or youre just too excited. its just another ipad. Watching this video made want one😂 Carry on boys and girls, keeps the shareholders happy. I note that only kings had flush toilets 200 years ago but technological, engineering and manufacturing improvements mean that every bugger has one now. Same with this toy. Meanwhile buy an A4 notepad and take a picture of it to work on later at home on your 30&quot; pc screen. Also Intel hardware is fine, you don&#39;t have to buy Apple. The US dollar is worth less than the pound?..... damn our country is f**ked, lol Ios apps are not better in 3d.....<br>There is no blender or cad? Only fools will buy and shill for such an expensive content consumption device. Greed has it&#39;s limits. $350 for a keyboard. $2000 for an anti reflective coating. Lol. Hey at least $2000 gets you a polishing cloth for free I-Glad? we&#39;re not broken, just bent and we can learn to love again, 😅😅😅 i think it&#39;s too thin It has to be that thin and light because most will put it in a case to protect their investment. Cool Disliked the video as it seems pointless. What&#39;s the app used in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=385\">6:25</a>? i can&#39;t unsee that @ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">00:43</a> I prefer Samsung’s Tab S9 Ultra all day Who was here when we switched to remarkable to focus and cut down on distractions they want to sell a laptop without a keyboard and sell you a keyboard to make it as a laptop Why bro why u can use nas for storage Everything you can do on that, I can do on my basic iPad with a keyboard case and Apple Pencil and I’ll save 3k. Again who’s this aimed at? Stupid gullible people I guess 🤷🏾\\u200d♂️ Google docs? On my Mac I can open five docs at the same time and three next to each other and on the iPad I can maximum two and it&#39;s much more finally and uncomfortable. Ridiculous pricing again by apple ! So good youll still need a mac book pro to use all its feature. So goooooooooddd. You did it because you have money to waste. This dude really spent $3600 on an iPad Dude just hyping everything on iPad right now while forgetting that it&#39;s all literally copied from Android tablets😂😂😂😂😂😂<br><br>Isheep from cave 😂😂😂 I would be interested if it could even do half the things I need on my Mac. I use my Mac for game design, web coding, and open source software. Which to my knowledge isn&#39;t on any iPad. I clicked on this..to say...I DON&#39;T CARE. AN M1 ipad would be good for many years.... Once iPadOS and MacOS are interchangeable and we can use the benefits of these new chips and it full on replaces the laptop THEN it will be a game changer, but to me a 2010 iPad is a 2024 iPad, what&#39;s the difference? It&#39;s usually iPadOs, it&#39;s using apps, it&#39;s using a keyboard and a pencil, it&#39;s a tablet, there&#39;s no reason to own a new iPad if you already own one.<br><br>I think it will be 2026 before anyone actually would &quot;need&quot; an iPad for work or college, until then..enjoy spending £2600 when you could get an M3 MacBook Air probably for the same price. I&#39;m hearing stories that ipad is at last replacement of the laptop for at least 5 years or even more. <br>Now it became best way to identify that video is sponsored by Apple, because they desperately want people to use it not just for watching yt videos and drawing sketches We&#39;re 400,000 subscribers away from the Giant iPhone build video let&#39;s goooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Its all fun and games until you want to run some docker containers. The answer to your question is very simple...<br><br>You are monetizing the contents. You&#39;ll be in for a disappointment when (quickly) learning the limitations of iPad. Hardware in iPad Pro M4 is magnificent. I would trade my (way more powerful) MacBook Pro to iPad Pro if it was just about HW.\\xa0<br><br>Unfortunately apps and OS are just way too limited to ever leave the house without MacBook Pro if you expect to get work done.\\xa0<br><br>Furthermore, Remarkable has a killer feature that iPad can never copy: It does very little. Thus, there are no distractions. Every hyping slim iPad as if that wasn&#39;t on Samsung since beginning of time 😂😂😂😂 Yeah the whole tech thing is really important, but where did you get that sweatshirt from? Love it!!! . OH MY GOD CAN WE STOP COMPARING IPADS TO MAC LAPTOPS!!! It’s not even close, it’ll NEVER be close! I have both a ipad and a MacBook. YouTubers keep insulting our intelligence by comparing iPadOS to a full desktop experience. It’s this a way to justify spending MacBook prices on a tablet. I LOVE iPad but $3000 for iPadOS because that’s what you’re buying,  is just dumb or flexing. Why are you paying all this money for this new iPad Pro M4. Because you have 18.5 million subscribers!! Why would you want to use an Apple product? Could be me, but I don&#39;t see a need for it to be that thin. I like things having thickness. Then it feels like it has worth. Because you know how to waste your money! The hardware is cool and all... but I suppose my issue is, the line between laptop and &quot;big phone&quot; is just an artificial boundary created by Apple. iPads have been powerful enough to literally just run MacOS for years now - there is no technical limitation preventing them from creating a device that does this. They haven&#39;t allowed it because it would cannibalise MacBook sales, so they&#39;ve kept the two user experiences separate. This whole narrative of &quot;it can now do everything a laptop can do!&quot; falls a bit flat for me because... of course it can. If they wanted to, Apple could literally have built a hybrid device that runs iPad OS with it&#39;s not got a keyboard attached, and MacOS when it does. The hardware is all there. Its cool that the iPad experience is getting closer and closer to a true &quot;laptop&quot; experience, but I have yet to see a compelling reason from Apple that explains WHY we are &quot;getting closer&quot;, instead of &quot;already there&quot;, at all. What I can do with iPad, can be done with my phone Bro hates docters bc it&#39;s your job? sounds like the last missing piece to real life star trek datapads is to make them foldable :D Thinnest device ever? What about the polishing cloth? If you like this , then you don&#39;t have any idea that  where samsung tab S9 ultra takes you too and enable you to what extent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=855\">14:15</a> Did you forget you can use your phone as a hotspot? True a cell can be a hotspot. My provider throttles the hotspot speed. Then I need to make sure that I enable the hotspot whenever I want to use my iPad. Or, I can just get 5G goodness on the iPad so that I can open it and use it at any time without having to do anything else. It is a different experience. @@martyscholes119 I didn’t say it wasn’t a completely different experience. But in my opinion, they’re not different enough to justify paying for another data plan. Once they integrate the ability to side load apps then I&#39;ll consider it. you dont have time to use ipad. no point in buying I buy it to read my manga😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=268\">4:28</a> this is just not true...iPads are terrible when it comes to multitasking. Tab s9 feels the same for me, here samsung sells it with the keyboard cover at the box, and is a wonderful kit. Much more cheap than apple, but high quality. OLED display, ip68, portable, high resolution pen, and now a lot of good apps. Yep. I couldn&#39;t see anything mentioned that my S9 tablet can&#39;t already do.🤷\\u200d♀️ exactly and its literally just as thin so I never got the crazy apple hype on that Yup, watching this on my s9 ultra looking at the pen like &quot;y&#39;all didn&#39;t have a button??&quot; S9 is better \\u200b@@FlyingSaucerD Apple users often have no idea that their technology is way behind other brands.🙄😂 @@GeeEee75ah yes, missing a button = behind in technology. \\u200b@aoming6398  If you knew what the functions of that button were, you wouldn&#39;t be confused. You must be an Apple user, because they don&#39;t know about any technology that isn&#39;t in their Apple devices. @@GeeEee75 so what if I’m an Apple user? I like their products. I’m just saying that missing a button doesn’t make them behind in technology completely. @@aoming6398 Ha ha, yeah, you keep using those Apple products, living in happy ignorance. @@GeeEee75 yeah, i’ll keep using them and i’ll keep being “ignorant”. One button missing isn’t going to make me reconsider.<br><br>I’ll be an iSheep for as long as i like their products😄 Didn&#39;t you say you loved your writing pad because it did only one thing and minimises distractions? Why would you want to replace that with an iPad? I stick to my Samsung Galaxy Tablet.<br>It&#39;s 5️⃣ X cheaper! What about a Macbook Pro with a touchscreen? for what i use my laptop for, i can do it all on my Samsung tablet. the magic keyboard (despite it being pretty expensive) would basically be all i would ever need. But using the apple pencil to turn it into a note taking device and pretty interesting. also multitasking on tablets is a great experience imo. I mainly use my tablet and laptop for media consumption and emails/light word processing. The pro would be WAY over kill for me but maybe the air or even the base ipad (especially at the new price) would fit my needs better. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=476\">7:56</a> lol There are a lot of reviews of the new iPads already posted.  Yours sticks out for your presentation which is top notch.  Super informative and well edited and clearly on a quick turnaround.  Nicely done. The e-ink unit will not disturb you while you work with notifications and social media. Seriously. Who in the right mind buys this over a beast pc. You could even buy a motorcycle with that money. 500 bucks is the limit for an iPad imo… I&#39;m not going to spend that much on an iPad. N e v e r. As an artist and architect I have to say a tablet goes a long ways in work processes. It’s definitely becoming a niche product for professionals. 400k until you catch up to apple.... Just get a surface pro instead, it is such a good tablet, many people forget to compare it to other tablets, and it ends up being compared to laptops more often than tablets. I feel like you could have done this video 3 years ago... Not much new here and really not worth the high end price for the 1 and 2 GB models. You can use Sidecar with a Macbook and 13 inch iPad Air. That way you have a slick 2 screen setup on the go, a real laptop, and the touch screen and pen features for creative work on the iPad when you need it. Plus you could buy both a Macbook Pro and a 13 inch iPad Air for the same $3600 price tag. He will ship it to me 😊, thank you @mrwhosetheboss iPadOS is soooo much worse then macOS Whats the song at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=350\">5:50</a>? I just cannot believe somebody would actually pay $3,600 for an ipad. <br>Now I understand why Warren Buffett sold Apple. <br>This company will be losing business 14 inch tablet is better.  I accidentally warmed up with Samsung and I sold all my Apple stuff it is literally better tablet my iPad pro 12.9 because you&#39;re loaded? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Because you are rich 🤷 The idea to just only using mobile OS is not for me. Coding for example is not easy on ipad iPads has been great for Art so thats my angle, they also do great in comparisons stacked-up against Wacom/Huion in this space and can offer more being a standalone. Not a fan of them starting off so expensive for the Pro models but its Apple right? they have made a lot of good changes to iPad Os to allow for less constraints but there is always room for more freedom/support here. Good thing there is not a MacBook 360 or this ipad would NOT sell. Unfortunately pad OS is bottlenecking the ipad so tragicly $3600 dollars for a tablet!? I could&#39;ve bought a PC which probably would have been much more worth it 😭 nice background music I sheep 4 times the average salary in slovakia and still no calculator :) in Canada it is almost 4k Youtube machine Ipad OS ruins the experience. Our 5 year old tab s4 has more software features. Dex is one of the favorites. <br><br>The thickness is very impressive on the pro! <b>People don&#39;t understand that the prices of things are never going back down. This inflation is deeper than we think. Those buying groceries are well aware that the real inflation is much over 10%. The increments don&#39;t match our income, yet certain invstors still earn over $365,000 in stocks and assets. Wish I could accomplish that</b> I have an ipad pro 6th gen, M2. I never use it. The only time I use it is when I feel bad for not using it. Or, when I use it for my survey work but that is to make my job easier and rare. Other than that it hardly gets used. It is already pretty thin. Im not sure it needs to be any thinner. <br>Personally if it is just a screen and faster chip then I wouldnt bother unless you want the fastest netflix device. Instagram doesnt even work properly, the app is shrunk down into a rectangle. The battery is terrrrrible as well. As I am getting further into the video......is this the first time in a while Arun has used an ipad pro. It is the same as the previous versions. Crapple is Garbage 🗑️ Apple: Spend in R&amp;D to catch up with the competition❌ Spend money to make thin products✅ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=239\">3:59</a> you will. $3600 is daylight robbery. Overcharging for devices has always been Apple&#39;s strategy but gotta wonder where they want to be with almost 165 billion in cash and over a trillion dollar in stocks. Greed and concentration of money. There’s nauseating materialism… and then there’s MrWhoseTheBoss nauseating materialism! Wait till you open the Instagram app Now your brainrot ads can load faster Bruh you have unlimited money just buy the damn ipad 💀 5.8K I just purchased one on PayPal credit, I have 4 months to pay 😢 Tablets need PC/Laptop OS, not a Phone OS. Then we can talk. It&#39;s so expensive, you can buy the most expensive gaming PC and still have enough to buy the rest that you need like monitor, mouse, keyboard etc. For the price, it&#39;s just pointless unless you ABSOLUTELY need it for like that 1 or 2 apps. But if you need to other accessories, then buy a mac. If they made a Mac with an Apple Pencil, the iPad will just vanish. To answer the clickbait…My guess, you have the money and needed some good content? (Could be wrong) Apple takes a dump on their consumers every year and their loyalists eat it up every time. Samsung wins the tablet market just for allowing their tablets to become PCs using DEX. Thinner and more powerful, definitely priorities. And of course make it more expensive, just what we need in this day and age. As an Apple fan I feel they’re out of touch with reality and what most people want. Wouldn’t be surprised if down the line cheaper competitors keep taking more and more of their market share. What is even the point in owning an iPod nano 7th gen in 2024 when it&#39;s no longer Apple&#39;s thinnest device?! 😉😛 3600... really? Apple treating its consumers: 🤡 Why is this guy always flexing over how much money he can spend? I’ve only seen a few videos, but all are like that. Not digging it, going to watch another channel for a review that is insightful instead of watching an inflated ego. It’s bullshit how much these cost I don’t care how good it is, it’s over priced as hell. Bro got sponsored from apple !???🍎 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=121\">2:01</a> why using remarkable when you can write on S24 ultra Yeah i would have gone an asus g14 with a 4070 instead It’s not $3,600<br>I just bought one with all the options maxed, with AppleCare, keyboard, and Pen and it came to $3,246.00 Pause Ipad pro for sure seems like an expensive toy. Even my ipad pro gen 2 seems way overpowered for what ipad OS can do. The new screen is nice sounding, but Ipad OS needs a lot of work before i care at all about improvements in compute power. I do love my ipad pro gen 2, but i am searching for a reason to want to upgrade. I use my iPad every day, all day but I must admit. It&#39;s not the tech that lets it down. It&#39;s iOS. It just isn&#39;t up to the capability of OSX. This is made particularly apparent when using programs such as Keynote which are dumbed down almost unusable compared to the OSX version. Even simple things like dragging attachments from one email to another can be a nightmare. On the plus side, my iPad has never crashed or overheated so there&#39;s that but iOS leaves a ton to be desired. Because you&#39;ll make more than the cost by simply making a video about it? And you can write it off as a work expense? I could think of a couple different reasons why you bought it. XD All we&#39;ve asked for is a decent ipad mini that gets updated... 2k or a bare minimum 1080p upscaled 120 hz <b>atleast</b> oled screen (no liquid retina or w.e apple calls them), an overclocked processor that is better than or rivals samsung, some amenities from the higher end lineups i.e centered-camera/productivity seamless ecosystem features ect, an apple pencil support that should work just as well as it does on the ipad pro with the edition of pro apps you&#39;d find on the pro as well (alot of people get apple products for the pro/apps and the mini is one of apple&#39;s best selling products so what are we doing here?) + the newer hardware-based ray tracing *self explanatory\\xa0<br><br><br>And for the love of God can we get a better multitasking/customization &amp; a pc like desktop mode considering the chipset and ram is enough Bro you literally are turning into an apple shill. It runs ipadOS and everyone knows many MANY programs do not work on it and you know this lol. The OS holds it back so much (even though the hardware is pretty fire) so to replace your macbook pro? Please stop Let’s see your review two months after using it instead of your Mac? It still runs iPadOS..... happy birthday to me 8/5/2024 big redesign huh? meanwhile everyone else: &quot;its still an ipad&quot; Bro just called me broke in 1,000 ways U were going deep with that smart tooth brush haha 😂 When will Arun create the phone that will be better than the iPhone i mean you could just buy a 13 macbook air. after buying all the accessories and keyboard and shiz its such a rip. 😂 this is the funniest justification of spending a ridiculous amount of money on something he doesnt need even a little bit.  Great youtuber but 6 months from now he will be thinking wtf was i thinking. It is a really light paperweight most days. Should I buy this as an first &quot;mac&quot;? Man called me broke in 40 different ways 💀 dont feel bad, even people who could afford them, wouldn&#39;t buy it because it&#39;s financially irresponsible to do such a stupid overpriced purchase arun did you change the title of the video I hate that everything needs an app and an account.  I much preferred a browser based world. the ipads will never be a laptop replacement, macbooks are just more versatile, you have macOS, which supports third party apps, more support for apps and more control with the help of your keyboard, unless ipads get MacOS support, i believe that it will never be a full on replacement. Yeah..all that is not worth the money. Another overpriced tech that doesnt bring much new to the table...usual Apple thing 8k cocomellon lol Aruunnnnnnnn! <br>Please don&#39;t use ads at the starting of video! <br>I like your videos a lot but there&#39;s one problem! <br>Every video is filled with ads!

Most other keyboards for tablets such as the Microsoft surface aren’t the same and you have you lift it with 2  hands and it just feels a lot more flimsy. The battery life sucksss, try playing a game and streaming it, your battery will go down even while plugged in. not having 120hz display on ipad air is disappointing . I can’t wait to watch jerryrigeverything punishing this new iPad to see how more bendy than the last iPads is NGL this is just another useless apple product because you’re rich and this video will make you richer Glad to see such a large tech YouTuber talking about what iPad Pro fans have been talking about since the M1. They still are not complete replacements for full pc’s. There are definitely several use cases that do not work on iPad, but for people that don’t need those use cases, like myself, the iPads are everything you need and then some. Honestly, in september, you should buy the iPhone 16. Copium brother im sorry it would be cool if the vibration motor would make the pen act like a real one and feed in light vibration to emulate the way a pen feels on paper😂 I wonder if the 2D battery will have a soft update to 3D like a puffer fish when subject to stress... Because that’s what it costs No Mac OS means lack real softwares for these M4 iPad Pro. Useless It hasn&#39;t even been a day lol Many of the things you missed were already on Windows laptops. Like the simcard. in short, not worth it literally just look at their pricing for the storage and it&#39;s obvious, $200 for $22 worth of storage (guarantee its even cheaper for them to produce). &quot;i was so surprised how similar it was to a mac&quot; yet more expensive, less power, and without the same versions of the &quot;pro&quot; apps. you could spec out the best laptop/pc possible for the same price. More overpriced trash Apple just went too far with the price Softwarewise. Ipad still not even close to a Mac...unfortunately.<br>And the old pen has a button. You can type 2 timer on the bottom side. Because you got $$$$ They should put handles on these like steam decks at this point 😂 yada yada tl;dr<br><br>the question is: can you bend it? can you do a review on brand new fax machines please? I&#39;m worried when my 20 year old machine fails i won&#39;t be able to get a new one Everyday I&#39;m throttling... din din din din ding din - ding di ding din din ding din I look forward to your follow up video titled “Turns out the IPad is not a replacement for my laptop” This functions are what samsung had years back, iphone always make it seem like its new and big deal🤣🤣🤣 anyone else thinks background on it is ugly? I love my iPad Pro. I won’t be upgrading for years, but I wouldn’t be without one for sure. I suffer severe migraines… a heavy laptop is too heavy to take to bed with me, the phone is not big enough for movies, and so the iPad just suits me so much. I can lay whatever position I need to, and still have a decent screen with decent sound. I also love using Procreate on it as I’m ordinarily a pencil artist, but my migraines can often prevent me from sitting up to draw on paper. Same here. I have my first and only ipad, the M1 ipad pro and I’ll never upgrade it in my life, I’ll keep using it as long as it works. Just like ipad serves almost all my daily functions and requirements, at the same time I don’t feel any need to change or upgrade it in future. So I think that it was a well made investment and just hope it functions the way it does for many more years to come. Mr. WTB: &quot;Smart toothbrush.&quot;<br>Editor: 😈 I have a clip for that. cause im a tech YouTuber I don&#39;t care about your wedding/new home/business - just tell me about the tech i use a tablet for university and it is very good for it, i&#39;m learning to be a pharmacist, so i learn a lot of chemistry and using the tablets pencil is essential, but i can use my keyboard when i have to write longer I do in fact dislike using &quot;the app&quot; of a service. I want as few apps on my devices as possible. TLDR he spent $3k because it&#39;s a shiny new toy. Doesn&#39;t do anything better than a PC, laptop or phone for what their advantages are, it&#39;s just neat to play around with. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but doesn&#39;t the M1 iPad already do the vast majority of what Arun is talking about? I have one and I can&#39;t see a ton of extra benefits aside from faster speed, and I never max the M1 out on iPad.

It makes the vision pro look affordable The new iPad is the cost of the Vision Pro, think about that, you get much more value with the Vision Pro. Yes, my man 😍 I aint spending literally thousands of dollars for a overpriced tray holder. The price for this is ridiculous. I bet sales for that m4 tablet is gonna disappoint Apple. Get a xioami pad 6 or pad 6 pro bro 😅   with hyper os they are the best for the price to value ratio I am currently watching this on an iPad gen 10 Jerryrigeverythign is gonna have fun bending this with 2 fingers!!!! I like trains 🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃 Your in for a very bad surprise😢 Why brother I’m about to buy too. Sorry that price is just being stupid for a tablet come onnn this is triple the price of my computer I purchased it too.  But I’m not happy that they haven’t included a macOS option when connected to the ipad magic keyboard.  Maybe WWDC? Things that he will notice upon buying it<br><br>It is a powerful device powered by a silly os, not simple.<br><br>IPhone apps don&#39;t work on iPad,  they can&#39;t scale on their own Writing with your hands is very niche idea to me. Keyboards are way faster, and macbooks have more capability in terms of functionality. Its not a professional machine, you still can&#39;t use desktop apps (which is the purpose of CPU strength in pcs), can&#39;t code, can&#39;t download outside App Store, and a keyboard is 350 dollars.. Not buying a macbook instead is just so pointless. Is there a way to have direct physical connection to ethernet with one of these?  Or can you only use wifi? A tablet can never replace a laptop. If you just want to type notes, watch videos, use social media. It&#39;s ok to buy a tablet. But when you want lots of resources, CPU, RAM, upgrade RAM... Van to cold up the CPU, a tablet is not the one to buy. I have apple watch o and a iPad Pro 2020 and a iPhone 12 mini and a make book 2020 and they all work great I use them all for different things like my Mack I use for photo shop and illustrator and video editing as it&#39;s better and quicker on a make but editing photo I do on my iPad and taking photos and messaging I do on my phone and gaming I do on my phone and iPad and my watch I use to track my steps and sleep and use \\uf8ff pay on it to I just think app le do thing other companies do but a year or more later then them but they release it later to make it better apple products are the best product ever Almost there to catch up with MKBHD in terms of subscribers 🍏 🐑🐑🐑 As long as these run iPadOS (just iOS in disguise) I ain&#39;t getting near that thing As someone who wants to switch over to an iPad for the thinness and streamlined apps (I don’t do anything power intensive), I was interested in getting the 13”. Then I saw the prices. At that price point just get a MacBook. Chanel is getting boring now ,he should go back to the basics Tablets are worthless (for me) bro, a laptop is already a filthy casual <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> caught me off gaurd tho 😂 How is &quot;thin&quot; even a selling point anymore. Its not 2015. Tech influencers trying to convince you that “this new ipad is different” I&#39;d rather get a gaming computer.  Honestly, everything Apple is overpriced. Cause it’s your job and for<br>Clicks… Gotta pay the bills somehow, 😂. 3600 dollars either buy a stupidly fast and wasted energy on an iPad or on a stupidly heavy smart scuba gear so basically it&#39;s a laptop with a detachable monitor that becomes a touch screen. Your review makes me the 2024 iPad feel like it is a brand new product and the M1&amp;M2/ older iPads didn’t exist before.<br><br>Also all the accessories people bought can’t work with the 2024 iPad. Remember sitting on a tablet and having it broken screen afterwards? When you sit on this laptop it will probably evaporate. xD 1. Because you have shitload of disposable money?<br>2. Because you gonna earn back on the views and marketing?<br>3. Because you are apple fanboy?<br>4. Out of sheer curiosity to see how it fares short and long term. Mostly because it will bring you enough views Made the same decision you did for similar reasons.  Will be selling my MBP 14 and old iPad Pro. a god gaming pc is 2000 how is a iPad $3600 ? Waste of money The iPad pro is certainly amazing however Apple themselves will tell you that their “pro” devices (iPad Pro, Macbook Pro and Mac Pro) aren’t meant for everyone.<br><br>Most can get away with the lower end devices like the Air (iPad and Macbook) or iMac/Mac Mini… <br><br>One thing I’ve noticed a lot with technology is that people are really sold on the marketing specifically that of Potential… If only someone could magic a way to load MacOS onto the iPad..... Bc you&#39;re rich and this is a fun purchase looks like this will run mac os and ios.. i still use iphone 6 from 2014, hasn&#39;t bent So....a macbook, keyboard sold separately. Are they really making the M4s debut in an iPad? The most Apple thing to do with this new release is making the existing product lines incompatible... The new Pencil looks great, but won&#39;t work with the 6th Gen Pro, and the Magic Keyboard finally having that function key row - But not working with any of the previous models... It&#39;s quite frustrating, but very typically Apple. I&#39;ll keep using their stuff though; it lasts a long time and is powerful (cries in wanting new stuff because it&#39;s new) Mrwhosetheboss spent lots of hours just to let us know about the iPad pro. Just look at his windows. Amazing For the first time the video felt a little biased towards apple, I mean a very small (can&#39;t stress this point enough) a really really small amount of people carry a laptop alongside a pad that feels like paper but isn&#39;t. The new ipad seems a great product for digital artists or people working around similar professions. The airtag is thinner and definately constitutes a device. Yeah no. Look I am buying a 12 inch one to replace my 2018 iPad Pro but 3600 on this thing is absolutely brain dead. I had a apple pencil<br>(i have no clue where it is now, i lst it somewhere) Honestly, this is robbery at this point You almost have ME convinced and I still use my Samsung Galaxy Tab A from like 2015 precisely BECAUSE of price.  I am eagerly looking forward to the in-depth follow up review! Do what I did. I replaced my Samsung tablet with a second hand iPad Air 4th gen that I found in perfect condition for 270 usd on eBay. I am loving this thing, it flies and just makes my previous Samsung S7 (which is two years newer) feel like a dinosaur. As someone who entire dumped the MacBook line once the iPad Pro and magic keyboard was released… this was the future I saw early and jumped on and have not regretted it once. Welcome to the club Yet you still need Mac or windows to download certain things. I&#39;m exactly on the opposite side. Bought an iPad Pro a couple of years ago and sold it 5 months later. I already have a smartphone AND a laptop AND a Mac Mini. 0 need for an iPad. I&#39;d only switch if they add MacOS, but I doubt it&#39;s ever going to happen. You are gonna be very disappointed thinking this will replace your Mac.  It is terrible to actually do productive stuff with.  Great for Youtube and Netflix.  Not great for much else Nothing about that ipad is a &#39;redesign&#39;! Nothing In 6 months: &quot;Why I am returning my IPad Pro&quot; You don&#39;t really need it, nobody &quot;needs&quot; it, and you certainly don&#39;t need the top spec maxed out version, but It&#39;s around one day of income for you. It&#39;s the equivalent of a regular person paying £150 for something. Having used an iPad for the last three years, I can assure you that I will never buy an apple tablet again. This whole video is you convincing yourself to push the buy button - I have this exact same conversation with  friends and family before I buy a tech toy I don&#39;t need - but &quot;totally need&quot;  :P   Love your videos So this is basically a video of Arun trying to decide whether he should buy the new ipad pro or not🤦🏻\\u200d♂️ Because it&#39;s a tax write off. Please do video about samsung a55 Pls  mi aipad mini pliiis me imim I&#39;m wondering, how much apple pays for this advert? Worlds most powerful Youtube and Netflix machine Damn, I could have used that $3600 better lol Just because because the cost price of entry into ipad pros is higher doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s overpriced. <br>They are 10x better than Android tablet trash such as the galaxy tabs who try to charge the same prices without even being half as good.  <br>Apple is giving TWO OLED panel display and M4 without even raising the starting price had it been gimmicky Android guys they would overcharge the heck out of it. <br>Take the galaxy fold for example. wait untill they drop the m4 comp He is evil. god no! if an app directs me to an app instead of a website that&#39;s the quickest way to get me to return it. that means it has tons of features locked down that should be part of it and it won&#39;t let you make it work with other things which it should be able to<br><br>not to mention it also means they&#39;re going to charge you more after the facts because they still have control over your device and how you use it instead of you. Buy samsung s9 ultra and compare them please iPad screen ratio is not design for watching video and iPad doesn&#39;t have full MS suite features. MacBook has both advantages <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=236\">3:56</a> I&#39;ll take it off your hands if you don&#39;t need it my guy As an Android user (Samsung / Motorola) what killed the tablets for me was the desktop modes (DeX / Moto Connect) in the flagship lines (S / Edge). I use it daily since 2019. The smartphones become Chromebooks! You just lost a bunch of credibility with this video… how much did Apple pay you for this?? I mean I guess if you don’t work on your own videos anymore, but just because they have an iPad Final Cut I still don’t think it can replace my Mac. And i know that you don’t genuinely think so either. Bro what, kids will still make it look like they found it in the toilet Imagine spending $3600 just to watch skibbidi toilet What game is that though? That&#39;s a lot of money for Peyton to spend on babysitting devices for Skylar, Anhalo, and Thaddeus. i couldnt handle those smudges and that big touch screen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=67\">1:07</a> Poor vision. Best reason for an iPad. With a decent back I bet it will feel more substantial. BTW, ever visit an Apple facility? Way more people of color in their advertising. who noticed him using his smart toothbrush Looks like a bit of a stumble to me. I&#39;m sorry, how much?? I guess I&#39;m not the only one who is tired about the TABLET - LAPTOP &quot;conspiracy&quot;? why can&#39;t I touch stuff on my MacBooks screen? what happened to those amazing touchscreen laptops from back in the day, they are just forcing us to buy 2 different devices when what we all need is a tablet like the new iPad m4 but able to handle all the software that comes for the laptop world. <br><br>In that specific case I wouldn&#39;t feel robbed when getting the expensive keyboard or an expensive pen, right?<br><br>Too conservative, they could do it. <br>I know all they care is revenew but are they doing the math right? Ya, something so slim And you know you&#39;re going to put a case on it...<br>Makes it kinda pointless Limited to one user.   ..  ugh Xiaomi pad 6? I have no interest in this product and still watched it, great work Don&#39;t switch jet, wait for the next generation. Arun when are u getting married &quot;the one thing that i really struggle to wrasp is tablets [...] i take this remarkable writing tablet with me, almost, wherever i go&quot; ...because you have the money? I almost bought the Galaxy tab S9 to figure it out the S10 date will be announced in the summer. I&#39;ll wait but I don&#39;t want to spend a lot of money for unnecessary extra&#39;s the tablet will be with. Idk what will be but I have my hopes up. Also waiting for accessories for that tablet will be long. The wallpaper they use when advertising the new iPads looks like abstract Dynamic Islands. So... for 3 times the cost of a superior galaxy tablet that does more, better quality, and doesnt insist upon itself, you can get the ipads answer to that, and then spend more to get the inferior pen? So the iPad air is pointless @DIYPerks they(apple) stole your double OLED idea sue them 😂 I agree on every point, but: Can I run my own code? On pc it&#39;s easier to pirate stuff. So if I&#39;m going the legal route I get lesser of a service because I ohmygaaaawd maybemaybe PiRaTe StUfF. I rather pirate and get unrestricted access whenever wherever I still own a 2016 iPad, and just pulled the trigger on the 11in. These tablets last long, and will stay with you a long time. i still have a 2013 ipad The iPad Pro could basically be a Macbook replacement, if using multiple apps simultaneously was implemented better. Whether you&#39;re talking about slide-over, split screen or stage manager, iPadOS still has some problems with which app is &#39;active&#39;. When watching a video and taking notes at the same time it still happens way too often that the keyboard refuses to type into the notes app, but types into the browser instead. Stuff like that make it sometimes completely unusable. If they fixed that, it&#39;d be damn near perfect.<br><br>Selecting text is also quite fussy, even with a trackpad. It&#39;s just less precise than on a Mac somehow. They over designed it with fancy animations and it just doesn&#39;t feel good.<br><br>But it&#39;s really close. Much closer than most tech reviewers seem to suggest. The OS is really nearly identical to MacOS nowadays really - when using Stage Manager in particular, iPad is basically the same as Mac. Except for those active window bugs.<br><br>It&#39;s mostly some power-user apps that are missing. But then again, you do get a lot of very polished apps back in return. Imagine spending a pc worth of money on a tablet just to find a kid watching yt kids on it can i have one? jk Because you have money 😜 Don’t buy. Just go to the next food bank! Apple kinda falling off. Interested to see the sales of this. Vision pro v2? Yoo I am still confused... Should I go for iOS or Android??? Why would you ever do that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=576\">9:36</a> bro has become the filthy casual and doesn&#39;t even realise it 💀 Very heavy laptop? :D Why I say I spent $3600 instead of £ when I live in the UK <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=920\">15:20</a> hopefully with apps sideloading coming to iOS we can finally get BitTorrent systems so we can do backups and have our own personal icloud. 🏆 you spend that money to make more money, not because its a great tool. Wtf its just other stuff to waste life away for 3600 bucks. If you can shit money its for you. bro help me with a laptop, i want to learn web development still better than spending $3,500 on the vision pro God, I love watching Apple people try to justify Apple products. i love ipads but WHY would u spend $3600 on one when u can get an M3 max MacBook Pro that has like 4-5x the power Watching this on my BRAND NEW Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra! Price: $1619.99 watched the Apple iPad event on my Samsung Galaxy smart Monitor 43&quot; Price: $599.99 WATCHING APPLE EVENTS ON MY SAMSUNG GALAXY DEVICES Price: PRICELESS!!!😅😂😅😂 i feel sorry for samsung the father of tablet&#39;s with a free Smart pen and oled since 2014 yet they never get any praise. Is this video sponsored by apple? Only issue with the ipad is that you cant use it to do what a computer can do, which defeats the whole purpose of the thing. Just put a video editing software on it and allow it to be able to code and you would have the most amazing machine, alas one that would also compete with apple&#39;s own other lineup namely the macbooks, so they dont do it. I would never be able to replace my Macbook with an Ipad until  the day the full iOS gets on the pad, till then the computer is worth the heft. This is the start of the title &quot;Macbook Killer&quot; ¡Erria! just following samsung ways , some apps will work better on the tablets , but &quot;processor contracts&quot; prevents them to use better CPUs/GPU.      ps: Tandem OLED exists since 2014 its nothing new , but a very expensive way of putting more brightness per pixel , mantaining temperature and efficiency. Because you have too much money to spend to create YT videos. :D I really dont know why its such a shock. There are apps now that take advantage of the ipad pro. I have the second gen of it. I use Procreate, Adobe Illustrator and Nomad 3D. And honestly Im on it more than i am my desktop. Its super powerful, productive, and portable. I dont know when i would need an M4 processor. Not once has it choked or bogged down. So although its exciting, I dont need it yet. Which is nice to know! Desktops get bogged down much quicker. Oh and I make choice not to use it for entertainment. Its a workhorse. First world problems This video theme is fire 🔥🔥🔥 The feel of an iPad with the keyboard and track pad does often feel like a Mac. But after a short time of using iPadOS, I still find myself rushing back to my Macbook. iPadOS is still the major drawback. You can get a fully kitted out 14&quot; MacBook Pro for $700 less ! PLEASE HEART THIS Imagine, an iPad as expensive as the most powerful consumer end pc in the world... The amount of effort put into this video is amazing Arun, glad to see your opinion on the new iPad Pro, which I feel everyday how you do about Mac and IPad It’s not the computing power, it is the Software that doesn’t let it become a laptop replacement. And there is no reason for Apple to let this hindrance go away to cannibalise its Macbook sales. As a student, I would not care about 10K multi thread score and fanciest ML capabilities when I can’t even use Excel and Word’s full versions and it is way too expensive and overkill for simple note taking and studying. Simple. I worked as an intern in a skin clinic where we used the iPad Pro 6th gen for basically everything from documenting to taking very sharp before and after pictures. And thinking about wanting that same system for myself when I have my own clinic, and comparing the specs from that iPad to the new one I think I still might go with the 6th gen. The price is cheaper (still more expensive than I would like for an iPad) and specs wise the 6th gen would benefit me more. Perhaps if the battery life is increased with the new one I might contemplate getting the new one but for now I&#39;m still going for the 6th gen. Also why is there one microphone less on the new one? And removing the ultra wide lens what is that about?? ill enjoy my galaxy tab s9 ultra Is it me,but it seems like he just found out that you can get an iPad that uses a SIM card? I wonder if he knows you can also buy laptops use a SIM card too? Chrome books, android tablets etc Absolute Waste of Money. They could just have attached the screen to MacBook and make it detachable wtf. It blows my mind that people fall for dumb products that look amazing... This guy is just an advert nowadays Apple just trapping people in their pathetic ecosystem looting money And the question left unanswered... ;) Bro image buying a a pencil when the slogan is bring new pencil experiance like bro what does that mean The iPad isn’t worth it IMO. The UI is not good enough. I saw Samsung ad on this video. Sorry, but still, it&#39;s no full Notebook like experience. It&#39;s just Ipad OS.. I bought an iPad Pro 3 years ago when my mac laptop died and I use it daily. There are some things I like about it, but many things that require me to use my Mac Mini via Jump/VNC. It is 2024 and we still don&#39;t have XCode for IPad. Fingers crossed the next update to iPadOS significantly improves things. it&#39;s a touch screen laptop.... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=1075\">17:55</a> I use 128 GB on my PC 🥲 I feel that students thrive from iPad the most, especially base model iPad, it’s just so easy to write notes on, Mac  would be best for college and work in my opinion anyway if you’re worried about BendGate 2.0, just make sure you don’t carry your iPad around in your back pocket. Should be fine. I mean this isn&#39;t a good look lol I want it To answer the title of the video: Because you can. 🤷\\u200d♂️ I just bought the iPad Pro 6th generation AND NOW THIS COMES OUT LIKE BRO WHAT WHY RIGHT AFTER. At least now you can write it off as a business expense... lol a 13 inch tablet for the price of a really good gaming pc. Good luck with that one. For half the price you could buy a mid range laptop with a GPU instead. The fact this is more expensive than the vision pro is absolutely mental <br>And it pains me to know that it&#39;s only being used to watch Skibidi toilet on youtube It’s only the maxed out specifications of the iPad Pro only when it’s maxed out it cost as much as a Vision Pro Your channel is much better than MKHBD I added every bell and whislte and could not get to the $3,600 figure. But why would you need to add all those things to watch YouTube videos on your iPad? This is... no.. please no.. dont swap your laptop for tablets.. The amount of programs you can no longer download, the amount of games you can no longer play, how can you possibly sit there and say app games are better? The hell. Even using mac instead of Windows is criminal for a tech guy. Why you spent? Because you&#39;re a multi-millionaire and $3,600 to you is the equivalent of most of us finding a quarter in the couch cushions. I use an iPad air 2 and it&#39;s indispensable. ipad os is very underrated. if you have an ipad leave social media, youtube behind for a while, find something else to do with it and you&#39;ll start to see the value. I have fixed it twice already and with it helping me with work, it&#39;s also paid itself off. I have my eyes set on one of the older iPad pros with the home button on it, they&#39;re still good and they still run ios 17 Nothing screams rich or stupid like a 3600 dollar iPad Let&#39;s be honest, he just wanted a touchscreen MacBook. So ......i dont need a laptop anymore ?.......woooow Answer of title: because I dumb 😂😂 Because you make $20k from every video you release. Thats why. Watching it like I can afford it 🤡 I just want a new iPad mini with at least M1 chip. Don’t really need a big iPad might as well carry my MacBook instead. Also iPad Pro with new keyboard and pen cost way too much and there is no need for a iPad Air lol honestly tablets should be under 300 dollars. If i get 10k likes Arun will buy me the same ipad. The iPad is a device that would be great to use if it was a 2 in 1 laptop. The iPad has only one non thunderbolt USB-c port and the RAM is too inadequate for development not to mention no way to build apps I am simple, I need ram. Intergrating any apple device in your life makes things more complicated. Sticking to pc, android, and google workspace is way better. Apple is just scamming people all the time. It&#39;s still severely limited by IOS. This is one of the reasons I got a Surface Pro. I wanted the portability of a tablet with a pen that was still a good productivity computer. Since the Surface Pro uses an actual computer OS, I&#39;ve had no issues with it. Granted Windows link with the phone isn&#39;t the best.<br><br>I would find it interesting if he did a long-term review of a Surface Pro vs the new iPad. Would that even be a fair comparison? Until iPads can play audio from two apps at the same time, they are not ready to replace laptops. You would be paying more money for an iPad Pro than for a MacBook Air, for a more powerful processor, but unable to take advantage of that extra power.<br><br>Here&#39;s hoping Apple updates iPad OS soon! No, iPads are not Macbooks. No matter how much apple try to convince us. iPad OS is in diapers compared to MacOS I did not appreciate that toothbrushing b-roll 😬 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=718\">11:58</a> This video now looks like an ad 😹😹 Fr😂 Because you&#39;re rich, that&#39;s why. FileBrowser Pro was a game changer for me with files. No tablet is worth more than 200 As an artist/designer I’m so excited for Art, animation, and 3d design. <br><br>I want the Apple Pencil pro too. It’s sad that it’s not compatible with the M1 iPad Pro…. <br><br>When they mentioned Zbrush I was like no way. I like how your videos have got (I think) more serious and less frenetic over the last year or so. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> AYO 🤨📸 Old pen? &quot;Gone, not compatible&quot;. &quot;Old keyboard? Sorry, 11 vs. 10.9 buy a new one&quot;. The royal scam company is at it again. It&#39;s absolutely mind-blowing the stuff Apple is allowed to get away with. How stupid can people be? Really. &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.&quot; because you got dollars stacked up through your roof? I would never in my life spend this much on a tablet that isn&#39;t even a real pc. Will it run next gen Crysis? Very excited to upgrade my old M1 iPad Pro which I paid almost $2000 for and have only used to watch YouTube and Netflix 😇 And that temporary effort in art on procreate and affinity iPad can never replace a laptop if you can&#39;t run full-fat software and are limited to the App store. Now if Apple lets you do full on development (i.e. gives you full Unix functionality, Terminal, ability to install IDEs, use the file system, install any software from anywhere on the internet...) then it&#39;s a true replacement. I&#39;ll wait for your recap and revisit I’m disappointed they didn’t just make the bezels much thinner if even at all. Would’ve been nice if they did and kept the footprint the same to be compatible with the previous magic keyboards Where is mrwhosetheboss did he move house If you are an editor / a music maker/ a gamer who plays games that have really realistic graphics it’s a good idea. Go to iPad Pro but if you are a person that needs something for school, probably a good idea togo with the iPad Air. if you’re just a casual Joe who doesn’t really need a big iPad but you still want something for Notes go with the iPad mini or if you want you can always get a refurbished iPad. If you didnt watch, heres the summary:<br><br>If you&#39;re rich, and love apple, buy the new ipad The current iPad Pro is already very thin. The difference in thickeness between the last gen and this ipad is 1.3mm.<br>iPad Pro 12.9&quot; - 6.4mm<br>iPad Pro 13&quot;    - 5.1mm Wait! Are we gonna ignore that he mentioned about him getting married? Congrats 👏 Nope. Not hoing to! ‘I’m an 8TB guy’ 😂 Me too. Just can’t afford it. When I think of Jerry rig everything I’m thinking this is up his alley No MacOS for $3,600? Mrwhosetheboss gave spoiler of moving to a new home so new studio tour video is coming soon..... I got a apple ad lol I still feel the S9 Ultra is a way ahead of this... I own an iPad pro gen 3 and it is basically an iPhone experience on steroids but you don&#39;t have the same flexibility as a laptop because you are restricted to apps that are available on ipad, it&#39;s great but you can&#39;t utilise the M4 processor at all Tbh I have a first gen iPad Pro with a logitech folio keyboard case and a gen 1 apple pencil along with a 2018 Mac Pro, and I have tried bluetooth mice with my Ipad when I&#39;m at home (cause the folio case has a keyboard but no trackpad), and when Im at college and tbh the Mac just works all the time, I constantly feel like oooo maybe the iPad will be better since it has a good keyboard (better than my mac cause the 2018 mac has a shit keyboard) and it can draw which can sometimes be useful when copying stuff off the teachers board, but tbh the mac just works better as an all in one. If you need to do work processing it is just better and the cursor because it is designed for touch is just simply less accurate and i constantly find myself using my finger when i have bought my iPad to college instead of my mac which is very annoying when you have clammy hands or you have just eaten. The new iPad Pro looks good but from my experience, nothing beats the simplicity of a Mac, it will always just work and seems to have a much better battery life too. But that is just my experience, I think Apple wants you to think that it could replace your Mac in order to try and get you to buy an iPad Pro but it just simply can&#39;t - they want you to double up on a Mac and iPad but it just isn&#39;t a replacement. Its one of them things which you think would be a good idea but isn&#39;t. Its kinda a decision you have to experience for yourself since I know for some it can be a replacement but even my mate who has an iPad Pro and Mac agrees. Petition for Arun to get the Pura 70 ultra Why do you keep bringing your wedding into the tech videos..? That&#39;s literally $5000 Canadian. 😵\\u200d💫😵\\u200d💫😵\\u200d💫 Oh boy watch when jerryrig get his hands on that 😂 They can keep it. This crap is for entertainment. My S23 Ultra works great for mobile and nothing apple provides out-of-box will handle my workload. this is what a biased yt channel look like Rich folk devices... many people struggle to pay for groceries. Ill start by saying i bought an iPad pro M1 about a couple of years ago and haven’t touched my MacBook pro since. Its an amazing product. Surfing the net, watching YouTube and i dont mind watching Netflix and such on it (actually enjoy it a lot). That being said, i would take a closer look at apps that you plan to use. Im a designer &amp; a photographer and the main programs that you would want, the app versions are not up to par. For example The Photoshop app is a joke! Its useless as a professional tool and infuriating considering the amount of money they want for in their subscription. I looked long and hard to try to find a good alternative and found one (affinity photo. What PS should be on ipad) but there was a long learning curve… its hard teaching an old dog new tricks😂. I will say lightroom is totally good enough as a professional tool on ipad. My personal opinion is that if the apps were full versions as in desktops, i would never touch a laptop again. The ipads are super intuitive and fun. Its $999.....<br>Stop trying to shame apple by choosing their highest specs, which is will end up being around $2399 even with the nano glass and 2TB storage. you spend it because you have the money to buy it or you may get it for free.who else buys a ipad for 3600$ You really seem to have had very low expectations of current tablet technology Would never spend that kind of money on a tablet or even a laptop Answer: you&#39;re an isheep, we all know how much you love apple and all their revolutionary products Hot, but imo bad take. It&#39;s still an iPad, as soon as you actually see the current software limits and experience the throwback compared to the macbook you&#39;ll probably at least miss the mac i was the same when they put an M1 chip in the iPad pro, ultimately, they are never going to make your iPad a laptop or a MacBook. Because it effects their bottom line. The Ipad&#39;s are held back solely by apple themselves. They will always be big phones, or small on the go entrainment devices. Just hoping it’s not another note 7 situation You can fix your storage issue with a nas system. Basically your own cloud. It can&#39;t replace a laptop. I&#39;ll say it again. Wake me up when I can run docker and compile programs on an iPad Pro. Watching this on my iPad I can&#39;t justify upgrade to this device when I can&#39;t fine a reason to use my current iPad pro. Ipad is not for programmers. I love this guy but this sounds like a LOT of copium 🥲 Hi how are you today mines on order too... Try to grasp the Apple Vision Pro ... been using mine for a few weeks now and im still confused. Make a video about ipad, ipad paid for. Sorry but you can use all the words in the world to promote it but for that money only brainwashed apple fanboys will buy it I&#39;ve been wanting to dip my toes back into the apple eco after being in google for ages but one of the big downsides for me in a tablet form is that I use my tablet to read on an app that is android exclusive. MF god scammed I absolutely do not prefer an app when a webpage will suffice. The browser has much better features (PWs, search) and works on a PC or anywhere. I hate downloading millions of apps to get something trivial done <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=340\">5:40</a> I don&#39;t why I laughed so hard. 😂 For 3600 that thing better runs 10 pc games at once on 120 fps and still have manageable battery life without overheating u haven&#39;t used files lol.its terrible n no safe eject still...<br>the is hold it back I have purchased a 13 inch Pro and over the next couple of years I’m sure it will be well worth it with the software changes coming. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> zesty ahh way to brush your teeth WWDC will either make the ipad useful or useless. Same crap.  Stick with a Mac. lol, apple tax is insane. Lumafusion beats Final Cut pro anyday on ipad editing , just saying ;)   lovin my m1 12,9 ipad still &lt;3 just buy a galaxy tab... way better iPad 10 best bang for the buck. Almost 1 1/2 yrs now, still perform great. There is like 29 iPads in that room give them some credit about pairing lol No, it will not replace your laptop..... Hmmm…. $3600 on an iPad Pro with \\uf8ffM4, and then there is the $3499 \\uf8ffVision Pro with \\uf8ffM2+R1, both basically run iPadOS, \\uf8ffVP also runs VisionOS…<br><br>\\uf8ffVision Pro should have shipped with the \\uf8ffM3 chip at the least… 🤷\\u200d♂️<br><br>🤔<br><br>🤔 how is Netflix better on the phone? come on Compare 1 min 10 sek when MrWTB reject tablet idea with 2 min 09 sek (59 sek, not even a whole minute 😂) where he admits to having his monochrome tablet at hand almost at all times 🤣🤣🤣<br>Priceless and just great. <br>Greetings to all. you got paid for this shit.... no way you didn&#39;t shit on it within the first 10 minutes because for some bizarre reason we all pay you to I hate to be a fanboy but every quality in the realm of &quot;laptop replacement&quot; on this New ipad was done better in the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra And still, they just cant make calculator app Anyway it is amazing new toy. Enjoy 🍀🍀🍀 I never understood why people want to swap their well-built laptops for tablets with keyboards. It&#39;s not better. You can get 360 foldable touchscreen ultrabooks for sub-$2,000. It&#39;s like reinventing the wheel. Yeah it is capable enough but what does it do what a Laptop can do? Except or artists, Where do I do complex excel tasks, Where do I run VM to run other stuff like poweBI,  Except for multimedia consumption thats it. It kind of sucks to look at a powerful and beautiful device but it can&#39;t do anything? I will keep my MacBook pro 14 36/1TB  for now,  was thinking of returning for the ipad but it just cant be used enough. When a 1 TB  ipad with only 16gb of ram costs the same as my MacBook and does WAAYYYY LESS. Yeah I also prefer that You can buy a car, high end gaming pc, three 55 inch oled tv.....etc for 3600 dollars. Apple is living in fantasy land with the current economy no body can literally afford their products anymore. 😂 I kinda miss the funny parts of your Videos.. It feels more and more like a documentation not a Youtube Video One thing about the Remarkable is that using it is a distraction-free experience. You&#39;ll lose that with the iPad. Yoooo!!! So I love your videos. But…did Apple pay you to make this video? You are tech king you and Marques but…everything you are wowing over isn’t new. I have the M1 Pro and all of the features you are wowing over have been in place since then. Except for the function keys. And then sure the M4 is super fast but why? There is literally nothing that uses that power. There aren’t even apps that use the potential of my M1 Mac. Try actually editing a video with Final Cut luma fusion or Resolve. It’s horrible. No plugins and you will be frustrated and go back to your Mac. I’m an Apple fanboy but your review of this iPad is almost 4 years out of date. I’m tired of the “it needs to run MacOS” crowd… they just need to keep improving iPadOS and bring over more pro apps. Many good points made in this video.  My M2 Pro is still overkill… the camera placement is actually enough for me to sidegrade (dropping down from 12.9 back to 11, since the screens are the same) - video calls and meetings are an all-day affair for me, so that’s huge.<br><br>Wallet stings for a second… here’s hoping WWDC helps justify it even more I love your vids keep it up Look forward to the follow-up video! Hey Aaron can you please test the Samsung Galaxy tab s9 Ultra? Please and thank you if you do🙂 I&#39;m more of an iPad mini person. For me, that 8.3&quot; thing is the bridge between doing stuff while on the move on my phone and doing actual work on my 13&quot; MBP. People watching this on the ipad pro m4 fully maxed out I would have  preferred a  smaller and faster iPad , over thinner. I guess I will have to wait for iPad mini pro! 😢 I really like the new iPad, but man I must tell you I absolutely love the Shirt you are wearing. (Where can I buy it? lol) I think they just put everything into their iPads cuz they have money and for will. Can people please just stop talking about it Why is there a gun inside of my iPad? AYOOOOO that smart toothbrush scene needed to be edited out haha lawd have mercy I am still using an samsung galaxy tab s6 lite from 2022 and I must say that for me its more than enough . Calling someone apple fanboy is the most npc thing ever Let us keeep it very simple. This is an overhyped device. If you really need an ipad get the air! &#39;I&#39;m an 8TB kind of guy&#39;<br><br>Looks at my 256 GB 🤣 Is it just me or it kinda feels like Arun has gotten a bit serious in his videos.<br>Just a doubt. I already have iPad pro and apple pencil M2 i don’t think i need this one I might sound stupid now, but why can&#39;t I use an iPad as a phone :P? I really want a bigger phone with good battery life. The iPad could be just that. Probably looks stupid when I&#39;m using an iPad to pay for things...well, nothing is perfect :D. But the 10.9 inch iPad or the magic keyboard I see you love that toothbrush 😮 My dad always tells me he wants an ipad pro, but knows nothing of the hardware or software. He just likes the screen size.. lol, absolutely never getting him a pro model just to watch youtube and browse facebook. Hes faired just fine with the standard model from a few years back My guess, iPad revenue will continue to decline yoy. Most families bought many devices already during COVID, with inflation and high price like this iPad, I don&#39;t see massive people coming out to upgrade unnecessary. <br><br>Watching this on Galaxy tab 9 ultra which cost less than $500 when I bought it, works awesome For your storage get Linus from LTT to make you a NAS system. If you drop it , screen replacement will cost 10k So scummy to make a new tablet which looks exactly like the old one, but takes only a new redesigned magic keyboard which looks exactly like the old one, and a new pen etc...apple really maxed out on how to re-release items to sell it again for profit. just waiting for all the breaks due to the thinness of this. waayyy overpriced apple stuff once again. How did the Apple Pencil feel on the nano texture screen compared to the ReMarkable 2? Laptops are for producing. iPads are for consuming. You cannot generate anything useful from an iPad. The fact it doesn&#39;t have file support makes it absolutely useless. Add as many colors, flowers, rainbows as you want but still will never be as useful as a PC until they solve the file system issue <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> Arun, we see what you did there 🧐 No floating- not even tiling windows. It&#39;s still useless and it will not replace a computer. 2800£ iPad 64GB + 400 Keyboard+ 300 Pen 😮 Reading anything is superior on the tablet, but doing work is still great on laptop. I haven&#39;t tried typing a whole paper on tablet lately. I always thought the hybrid with detachable tablet is a great idea  but hasn&#39;t been perfected. I don’t see why apple doesn’t combine the macbook air and ipad pro basically making a lenovo yoga allowing you to fold the keyboard back and adding a touchscreen. I&#39;ll be living vicariously through you, brother, because there is no way in hell that I&#39;m paying $3600 for an iPad normal people should wait and see what new capabilities can be done before they spend that kind ofmoney …to be honest seems like a routine spec bump Hardware is top notch but they need to up the OS. Can you delve deeper into exploring integration in professional settings? we are entering a new era of desktop-hybrid devices.. ipad+keyboard setup is a new imac You can get really decent gaming laptop for that kinda money Not worth it since base 10th gen ipad or ipad air can do the same way cheaper and plus they might as well market it as a macbook air replacement im watching this on a ipad air 3 the real answer:<br>because you are STOOOOBID! guys i own an imac from 2017 which works pretty good but i need a portable device so what should i get between the ipad pro 13 inch and the macbook air 15 inch? considering i own an imac Answering the question: because you have to make this video... 3600 😂😂😂?? this guy is so god damn fake. I did this transition from macbook to iPad in 2020 (iPad Air + Pencil + Magic Keyboard), but came back running for a mac in 2022 because iPadOS sucks so much. Good luck though! To answer the question in the title... It&#39;s because he&#39;s rich and he can. So, we got a foldable iPad now? If I imagine what this money could buy me: a super powerfull number crunching Laptop/Workstation for AI Dev. and Computer Vision I get absolutely dizzy. I have a doubt. As a lot of smartphones these days are performing better than Apple, why can’t Apple put their fastest chips (M2,M4 etc) in their phones to make them the fastest?? Really makes me wonder why they haven’t put macOS on iPad. What&#39;s that saying??? A fool and their money are easily parted. The apple pencil for me is the biggest piss take. Use ya fingers way cheaper.<br><br>Also the Ipad at this point is an outdated overpriced gimmick. I see no point to them at all apart from when people give it to the kids to watch peppa pig on youtube. Also almost £3000 with a pencil and keyboard. The mark ups from what it cost them to make to selling no wonder they make a bazillion quid year on year. Just because it has a powerful chip doesn&#39;t mean it can do everything. It doesn&#39;t even have the same passive heat dissipation system of MacBook because no apps can utilize the SoC at full potential. This thing only allows short bursts of calculation/processing for a short period of time. Also ipas os limits how much background apps it can run at the same time unlike macOS without any limitations. Apps also need to use less memory because only certain types of apps can utilize much at a time.<br><br>It should be like surface 2in1 detachable screen laptop I mean simply a MacBook or Mac pad with full performance but then how could apple sell more devices?<br><br>Hence they&#39;re trying everything to limit it and make a different product line.<br>Want something to write? Get an ipad! Want something to do exclusive processing? Get a MacBook. <br><br>So basically users are most likely to buy both devices.<br><br><br>I am waiting for the snapdragon based 2in1 detachable laptop which can solve this issue once and for all. Maybe Microsoft could&#39;ve done better if not killed android apps support. With that they could&#39;ve provided better touch screen apps, many android apps now work with foldable/tablet UI due to scaling capabilities like a desktop app. There&#39;s also an app window resize features like freeform windows.

Without an OS improvement, the iPad is objectively worse than the Mac. Don’t buy iPad Pro base model come with 9 processors 1T byte come with 10 processor apple is ripping off ppl .😢😢😢 Would love to hear what you think about the textured glass decision after living with it for a bit. People made a big deal out of the Steam Deck OLED doing this and how it would affect contrast, and that ended up being effectively a non-issue. The iPad appears to have a much more matte finish, though. I just saw the title and I was like maybe you have a channel on YouTube that you review them?🤭 You said last year you had the other device to sort of free yourself from the device that can do “everything”… so what’s changed? Consider carefully when getting iPad. If you getting iPad, don’t YouTube on it cause your iPhone also do YouTube Most of it sounds like copium. You can do it all on the M1 ipads minus most of the costs. Nice contrasting perspective to MKBHD&#39;s view that powerful tablets are unnecessary. Ur a multi-millionaire, big vro. You know it’s not really gonna matter. 3600 to you is 360 to most ppl, and that’s being conservative. But I get your point in a sense, since you are trying to make a YouTube video, and that creates a more compelling story. Besides niche use cases the price it is not justified. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=184\">3:04</a> iPad bought in Rome, Italy... Cellular connectivity on the iPad is incredible especially for $20 a month… Remember the MS surface pro. 10 years ago.. And the new one has the pen inside the cover. 2700 all in. With core i7 i also use a smart toothbrush Bro what do you do on 8 tb ☠️ Isn&#39;t it weird all ipads still only have 12mp Camara So, I decided to stick to Windows 🙂 When you want wool from sheep Cos you can afford it easily? I&#39;m curious what the durability of that nanocoating will be like. Wouldn&#39;t a better solution be to get a matte screen protector? Much easier to replace if/once it wears out. With the launch of the new iPads, we can expect the prices of the last gen to be slashed. So can you make a video on if we should go for the iPad Pro M2 or iPad Air M2 No terminal! 💩💩 needs macos to be worth that. Mrwhosetheboss or anyone else who can answer this question, what MacBook would you recommend I buy? I’m thinking of purchasing a MacBook for gaming and schoolwork so I want one that has lots of space, very fast, and can handle like high graphic, high quality type games like HSR, GTA5, or Roblox. Any recommendations? Apple sucks. That is all. Me rocking my 9th gen iPad I moved from ipad to Samsung due to the OS ... Samsung OS is night and day ahead of ios!! I definitely do not love being redirected to an app. I LIKE having ONE browser app, as opposed to 1300 individual apps for every single thing I need access to. Apple stopped innovating. It&#39;s sad. I have the iPad Pro M1 with a Magic Keyboard and it isn’t. iPadOS is sadly still the limiting factor in my opinion. MacBooks are just much nicer to work on could two monitors be connected to it to use like a mini mac which is not yet with M4 chip Which sweatshirt are you wearing? It looks really cool and nice! @Mrwhosetheboss Where is your jumper from? . . . Dude,  I guess this time you made a review on a very narrow user frame. I guess most people don&#39;t use ipads instead of their computers, but together. That makes sense for designers, for sure, but also for studying, for making presentations, reading, making notes, watching videos portably, reading sheets on the piano,  even as an extra screen close to the computer for productivity, etc. Nothing justifies a 3k tablet in my opinion, but to reduce using possibilities of tablets to big phones or notebooks of the future is a bit narrow minded in my opinion. I understand why you don&#39;t think it is the best product for your routine, but there are many ways in which tablets are useful on everyday life. I carry my Ipad on a shouderbag almost everywhere I go. No notebook or cellphone will cover that. Repent and believe in the gospel of Jesus and you will be saved 😄 16mins of Arun convincing him self that is not a waste of money to have this tablet :D Bro the iPad kids gonna be going wild😂 bro needs to get a chromebook I could tell you &quot;why&quot; but you tube would cancel me... As Marqus said iPad is an iPad, new Windows tablets are coming with more powerful ARM SoC, I will rather wait. When Apple decide to run MacOS in an iPad I may rethink. Those look too thin in my opinion….i would rather them put more money into the build quality and durability to make it LAST! Rather than cut out .5 ounces here and there. Bro the way I see it, the iPad is an overpriced gimmick and a failed alternative to a Laptop. Like seriously all that M4 juice just to watch Netflix or play PUBG. Now people will defend it by saying you can edit videos and photos on it with peak level of performance but that&#39;s a very small usecase compared to what u get on a full fledged Laptop/Desktop. Like seriously what you&#39;re gonna do with the M4 if it&#39;s paired with the iPad OS, can u run Blender on it or do high level coding or Machine Learning. This would be great product only if they had provided full laptop level compatibility on the software side  rather than sticking 300$ keyboard and trackpad. Well that’s a bit harsh and the majority disagree - for certain people yes that is very true but in reality both have their benefits and disadvantages. If you had an iPad and got used to it you might see the countless benefits but your core point is somewhat justified. I am an iPad user though so I do mostly disagree with you. @@kianandtheviolin I respect your opinion bro !!! you may be enjoying your iPad experience as it fully meets your use-case which may be true for the majority but the thing is that if I&#39;m paying that much money in the name of Laptop Alternative or Laptop replacement, then I expect it to be able do anything a laptop can even if it&#39;s out of my use-case. It&#39;s the same logic why some software engineers tend to buy gaming laptops (windows) even if they don&#39;t game that much. Because as a developer or a designer, it&#39;s always good to have that power and capability in ur hand. Otherwise just don&#39;t sell it as a laptop replacement by putting a M4 level chip and charging 3000$ @@sarthakshukla7217 Thanks for the respect! It’s nice to know there’s not only strongly opinionated and stubborn people with opinions nowadays. For developing of course the way to go is windows or mac because you aren’t making apps on an iPad XD - also it was mentioned in the video that most apps for iPad are better, but I actually disagree with that in lots of cases and agree with you - like I do music tech and compose, and although I have Logic Pro for iPad, I am never going to replace my mac version with that. Mac and Windows are just more versatile for high-performance use cases, and unless you are on the go and use a lot of iPad apps, Mac/Windows is definitely the way to go. The iPad Pro is a device I carry with me all day and can do some but not all of what a laptop can do. My MacBook stays docked on my desk, connected to three external monitors, and can do some but not all of what my iPad can do. Meh And I have been a Pencil user. It will always be shit. For the masses, the macbook air is probably the most utility per dollar you can get by spending on an Apple product iPad needs macos otherwise it is nothing more than a YouTube machine Well there are great apps built for iPad with more features on iPad. Some sort of MacOS support would be good though - like maybe being able to sync it with your Mac account and be able to use a cut down version of MacOS? two panels but OLED to post it on youtube and have adsense rain? I watched on iPad We just need better apps, more pro apps, but even so....  I&#39;m very tempted Only recently been using a Remarkable2. It&#39;s an Apple vs. Orange comparison, mate. Remarkable is designed for a different universe. 5.1K Why?

Have you had a sneaky Apple sponsorship deal recently? highly doubt you&#39;ll replace a Mac with this... def not for me “Cause I can” end of the video. I usually think of my tablet as a basically infinite notebook. I usually use it for drawing and taking notes in classes, and it&#39;s pretty good for that... But as someone who&#39;s learning IT, I still need my laptop for programming and other heavier tasks, I can&#39;t see myself switching to a tablet, even if there would be a similar quality android tablet. iPad just doesn&#39;t makes any sense for the professional use apart from graphic designers and 2D animators. It&#39;s file organisation system is very poor, it doesn&#39;t have nearly as many softwares a PC or MAC has. It&#39;s very restricted from every department as much as I initially hated on MAC for not being even near as pirate friendly or open to Windows, I started appreciating the heck out of MAC after using the iPad. On top of it, it&#39;s costs as much as a MacBook. Really pointless! his parents had to disown him by now BUT, it is limited , to using iPad OS.... M2 Pro is still the best choice for average users.

If you need storag just get a 2 Terabyte MicroSD™ and insert it into the extendable storage Can&#39;t wait to pick one up for $500 in 3 years For an iPad, seriously?

The only reason would be because you CAN buy one. No other reason. Who use Tablet nows a day. Its a waste of money. crazy how they all complained abt the price of apple vision pro but are happily paying this much for an ipad I&#39;m hoping that nano coating will come to the iPhones. Amazing how Apple manages to impress even when it was so obvious what they were bringing to the table, I’m eager to see teardowns, drop tests and bend test on this crazy thing and absurdly powerful device. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=22\">0:22</a> me when the soup is too hot because you are a rich youtuber and you dont give a fuck The surface pro left the chat Only The Apple nerds will only Buy this ipad. Out of which 80%(Probably) are Show offs. Who are actually poorer. 😂. At the same time. Real Creators/Designers even if they own one, doesn&#39;t even use much. Bcs the productivity experience what they have doesnt seems convenient for them to use. With the same price, they can do or buy better. It’s not needed to be that thin and the battery could be 20 hours by adding a millimeter. And i‘d put it in a case which has probably them same thickness as the tablet. Did you try to bend it? I suspect there will also be thermal issues as SRAM scaling is over. So that’s the definition of a Tablet. And this falling to the ground will be instant dead. And also its still crippled by not having macOS it makes it not worth it again.. thats a perfect amount of slimness. Now i can add a case without it being BULKY I&#39;m cool with a phone and a MacBook pro Breaking a bone is cheaper than breaking the iPad That&#39;s why my 13 y\\\\o cousin was crying BC she bent her iPad lol Love the sunset effects in the background.. oh .. wait. iGlad indeed. What!!! theres something comforting watching this while not being willing to upgrade to any post 2017 apple product true, its interesting to see what the next generation of devices are capable of doing... but 2017 tech is more than enough for current day to day use @@alexlun4464 yeah at some point theres no visible difference in performance to the average user and anyone who upgrades to a new device with features meant for pros will have to suffer from the sacrifices made for those pro features that they never were planning to use you can&#39;t manage files that well on tablet as on pc Arun, you are definitely one of my favorite tech reviewers, but your presentations are above and beyond everyone else! Thank you for your hard work and dedication! To sum it up, he’s rich You’re using the toothbrush wrong The amount of lies and contradictions this video has is disgusting. Great vid!👏👏....keep it up Team Mrwhosetheboss!💪 Because you are rich.  No other reason. I am watching this on a M1 iPad Pro. Performance still snappy and oled screen still nice. A used M1 iPad is $450. I’d totally recommend to anyone. Bro just bought a Macbooh, but worse I pretty much use my iPad Pro as a laptop and it works real well.  I have a PC desktop that I use for everything else (gaming, development, rendering, etc).  Wish I could justify getting the new iPad Pro but my old IPP is a tank and just won&#39;t quit. try using some of the windows surface products. i for example habe a surface pro 7 and its basicly a tablet and laptop in one (+ not really expensive). its great for school/ work Let me get this straight, apple is good at iPads think again theres a lenovo thinkpad yoga thats better and it have anything like normal pc omg! are you kidding me ? How can people compare iPad to Macbook? Oh yeah if you are only watching YT Plot twist: Samsung makes Apple screens😂😂😂 Once I&#39;ve heard a kid say &quot;money comes, money goes&quot; You guys killed this review I watched over 20 and your review is by far the best great job Only got past the first 6 mins of this video but im kind of disappointed how sold Arun is on this overpriced tablet for people with disposable money.  Apple has a way of $making$ its current users think they need the next best thing. “I’m a very exited man right now” Crazy how parents are gonna buy this just to give it to their toddler Ill save you the time its because he is rich…..your welcome So pretty much like my iPad Air 4th Generation in terms of weights and portability. If you are a software developer or need to work anywhere near that arena - iPads don&#39;t cut it. So you have to have both a MacBook Pro and an iPad. Same goes for video editing - both Davinci Resolve and Final Cut Pro are crippled on the iPad.<br>The iPad will never be a MacBook replacement for professionals.. And oh - also, once you add the iPad keyboard - the combination becomes heavier than a MacBook Air. If you have the money - then yeah, knock yourself out. But it still no where close to a serious device. Better off with MacBook and the most cost effective iPad you can find - and it is still good enough to replace your electronic paper device. That&#39;s like 12 month of rent where i live omg,, im an artist and i know apple tablet are nice. It&#39;s just gonna be my another whishlist someday ill be so rich i will consider getting it . ;-; 3600 usd is soo soo much God nerfed me with money cuz he knew I&#39;d be unstoppable if i had such things lmao but hey,, 🥹🙏🏻 Americans are gonna like the M4 chip for sure. Arun, we are REALLY close to overtaking Apple in subscribers. Just 300,000 to go<br>Let&#39;s do this!🎉🎉🎉 13&quot; iPad Pro with absolutely everything (inclusive AppleCare+, pencil, keyboard) costs $4197 here in Sweden. Outrageous. Apple knows kids are growing up with iPads the same way our parents grew up with Walkmans and desktops, the same way we grew up with laptops and smartphones. These are not for us, but for the next generation of consumers. Money simple Why are your videos dark now? Now I am guarantee getting the iPad 13inch pro 🎉 after this video. apple needs to discontinue either the macbook or the ipad! they are just running out of reasons to distinguish between the two! migrate mac os to ipads or include touch screen functionality on a mac! You know what would actually make the iPad a real deal breaker. It would be if they added a desktop profile that behaves exactly like macOS, kinda like saying &quot;I wish the iPad had both iPadOS and macOS&quot;. Ever since the M1 ipad pro I&#39;ve kinda been annoyed at how the thing looks like it could be Like A Laptop but it really isn&#39;t.  Stage Manager on M1 never seemed to quite work properly for me, either. Get ready to be disappointed as a laptop replacement the OS needs a serious update. for a tablet to cost me so much it needs to do A LOT more. especially already owning an iPad Pro, there&#39;s no reason at all to update. still no mac exchange since file folder and management is still very bad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> what that mouth do ;) Why Apples market cap is over $2trillion lol I would like to state that i dont like to see tablet drifting into the luxury market and apple seems to be pushing this more and more especially because they often underspec cheaper alternatives namely the normal ipad and they overcharge for the ipad air, Sure it&#39;s useful for video/photo editing or even documents. But still pretty useless for software developers. When Visual Studio comes out for it and lets me write full dotnet apps, I may change my mind.  For me, it&#39;s mostly just an entertainment device and doesn&#39;t really need much power for that. I have to say though that im not a big fan of too thin devices, in a thicker one you could theoretically house bigger speakers a better cooling solution for the processor and a bigger battery plus you acheive far more stability. I wouldn&#39;t use it in a magic keyboard to be honest normally logitech builds high quality accessories but im a samsung tab user so what do i know. When someone is so rich that you can&#39;t relate if u wanna write just carry a notebook bruv and write on paper with a normal pen For us minority who use the Lidar a lot, with apps like Recon-3D and Sitescape, the extra muscle is nice. Also watching 3D models of complex buildings without staggering. Did this man just use ... mobile gaming .... as an example of an improved gaming experience.....<br><br>lmao<br><br>We have different use cases, but imo the mobile experience is almost never better than a desktop class app. I own a regular Ipad and the only thing I prefer to do on it is draw with procreate.  I would much rather edit photos, research, write, design in CAD, game, or do pretty much anything on a big monitor and with a pc that is more powerful for half the cost than this Bendgate 2 Pro. Sure if you have plenty of money to throw away, and dont have that demanding of a workload the weight advantage is nice, but used car money for a tablet is hilarious. With all the accessories i suppose this overtakes the vision pro as the most expensive netflix machine. Sorry, you lost me when you praised how simple and &quot;better&quot; it was to photo edit on it but glossed over the 50% longer times to do super intensive things (you know, the kind of stuff you would want a MacBook for but want to replace with an iPad). TLDW - he did it for the clicks on YouTube I don&#39;t agree at all with the &quot;apps are better on mobile then on pc&quot;, but I might not be the mainstream user that uses Apple stuff or even worse, Windows Is no one still gonna mention the fact that the iPad Pro only has 1 camera instead of 2? Now internet I&#39;m gonna expect you to be mature with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> and not do anything rash. You are all better than that, right? The nice thing about the m# macbooks, you can already run the iPad apps... Because you gonna return it right after the multiple videos you gonna make of it I tried the same but at the end, the missing file explorer makes it hard for people who need it. Why? he says it&#39;s better when a product asks you to use their app. I actually hate that, having to install a separate for every thing that i want to do only once or twice. Have to mention how soft the talking to camera shot is. The colours and contrast are also off.<br><br>Your eyes. The most important thing to get right with this kind of video... Look like dolls eyes.<br><br>Has to be shot on a phone. The pixel quality on phones isn&#39;t good enough yet for this to look good or even acceptable. Sorry. <br><br>You should probably stick with larger sensor, dedicated video cameras... I&#39;ve got a 12 year old iPad and it still works perfectly. They are great things - and the screen is still brilliant. Imagine getting green line 🤪😜 I ordered one but the low spec.  But can it replace my &quot;real&quot; computers?  No.  Because if iPadOS.  The hardware is way beyond what the OS is capable of.  Maybe they&#39;ll fix that some day... But probably not. paying almost as much for the new apple pencil as you paid for the e-ink tablet says it all. At this prices, I will expect my devices to fly or is it too much to ask Shoutout to the Remarkable Tablet. I have one for work. Love it. When is apple making a touch screen macbook pro Only real Mr whose the boss fans would like this If the new ipad ran standard macOS it would be an amazing laptop replacement.  If youre a dev, ipadOS 17 is not usable Did they finally make this MacOS or is it still IOS?  Nooooooooooooooo.  We have Tablet windows devices dropping this year, Apple screwed up again. M4? Its not a bmw lol I see Your money, your choice bro. Its understandable, from a content creator standpoint. Tablets needed a massive revamp, in terms of software and hardware, which wasnt really happening all these years. I see the usecase in M4, and developers need to use the potential of M4 to unlock its true power in new apps. Thankfully, lightining is removed. I want to know more about that ink notebook 😄 name, brand, price? Looks goood Aaaaaah.....rich people issues. Do I spend $3600 on a plate of glass, or not?

And it&#39;s just as thin. @@VeederRootI don’t think apple has ever sponsored anyone ever. I think he just doesn’t know that as powerful as the iPad is there are no applications that take advantage of its speed. He’ll probably figure that out soon. @@averydee5328yeah,and the Biden administration has never pressured socal media companies 😂.

But these are tooo expensive. You need to be very rich to be able to comfortably afford these devices and if your not and you still buy these products you are probably being fiscally irresponsible. “Apple employee holding the camera and pointing a gun to his head” Maybe he is just giving his honest opinion. @@averydee5328 true but take in consideration that he is a tech reviewer, and his sole purpose is to well...... review tech without bias @@whyisitsodifficultomakeahandle That is correct, but this is a &quot;why I spent $3200 on an ipad&quot; video, not a &quot;why you should spent $3200&quot; he goes into all of his own reasons, not reasons why anyone else should.

Also, even Marques seemed to become less biased after that! @@VeederRootMaybe because it’s the truth and you Android fans simply don’t have the brain capacity to handle it Apple scamming everybody all these stuff they bringing out is all the same I did calculations the iPad is 15 percent faster than m3 Why I spent a fraction of a percent of my net worth on an overpriced tablet. It will be around 9 lakh in Pakistan When you get your new iPad Pro, you should challenge your editors to use the updated iPad Final Cut Pro to see if an iPad can really replace a Mac. Previous versions still take 10 times longer to use than Mac&#39;s Final Cut Pro. So this new guy to technology never saw iPad before and this seems to be first time using it with the keyboard or hold it for the first time. Someone tell this new guy that laptop cannot be replaced otherwise apple would stop making Macbooks. There&#39;s no excuse to this. You can get a M3 pro mac for this price, what a joke. Someone should help me with ipad please😢 i will appreciate an model 😭🙏 Where was Rick Astley!!! Did I miss him 🤔 TLDR, because he&#39;s got more money than sense. lol So... you would be exchanging you laptop for a tablet that you will add extras to in order to essentially make it into a laptop... lol why? there they know how country where you came from made a deal of loss by setting up iphone assembly facility The title changed from £3k to 3.6k This is what 90% of iPad users went through in 2018 😂 I’m sorry, HOW MUCH??? Why I don’t spend $3600 on an iPad Apple ruining hardware by not updating software for older devices. Anti consumer, greedy and no support and no innovation. Gaming laptop &gt; 3500$ iPad 🤣 Apart from the fact that the Apple&#39;s OS has always been shit in literally all of their devices, clearly including the rather yearly &quot;updated&quot; iphone, it&#39;s simply no surprise. The restrictive nature of apple is obvious in their OS and you simply can&#39;t do crap; compared to other devices from different brands. I had apple for years, and I decided to stop buying their scammy little woke shit products. Stop funding this load of scammers that try to create a standard when in reality they are controlling and restricting you to hell with devices that have hardware that is not worth it compared to other option in the market, and an OS that is the literal definition of &quot;shitty restrictiveness&quot;. Free yourself from this crap. Being positive to pay 3600 for an iPad that is nowhere near MacBook on performance nor in applications. My M1 just working fine. I&#39;ve got an iPad Air M1 and I love writing my notes on it. However, its hard to find the appeal in upgrading when the spec bumps won&#39;t get utilized for my workflow. Also the most annoying thing about the iPad rn for me is just how unresponsive the &quot;mouse&quot; interface feels. It has a very noticeable delay that just makes things feel slow and not worth doing on the iPad rather than macbook or pc for long tasks. Navigating through text using the keyboard is also somehow slow. I&#39;m holding off on upgrading until the software gets alot better (hoping for great software updates to the ipad in WWDC). I just take the moment and embrace the fact MrWho is getting married, congratulations in advance brother.<br>Hitting the pinnacle of life. Oh get a WiFi and cellular connection iPad Pro M4. Well..simple, buy a non pro iPad and let the pro buy those because they are actually for the pro. Yes I can buy pc…mac or windows…but can I take it to the park and work, on the plane, anywhere, backyard….it’s just common sense. Trashing this product when you have better suited product for your needs. reminds me of a better performing Surface Pro @mrwhosetheboss you should make a video about Galaxy tabs9 vs the new Ipad and show each one`s capabilities, otherwise it sounds like you`re biased towards Apple, considering Samsung has been doing everything you said so far in this video, for years, speacially considering the Dex Mode (the old one not the new one) They fixed the iPad MacBook cannibalization problem simply by raising the prices on the iPad 😂 Apple users are such mugs 😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=600\">10:00</a> - I disagree.  Companies want you to install their app(s) on all your devices so they can get your info and sell/use it and push ADs onto you/etc.  Your safer sticking with websites. Where will we be attending the wedding from?😅 Now why do we need a mac😂 I see no problem on replacing my laptop with a tablet. I actually plan to do so, when I need to use some desktop stuff I can ssh to my workstation and problem solved I live in the US, and I am more excited about the new government lawsuit than I am about the new iPad, lol. Oh and I have that Keyboard, lol. bro didnt buy the ipad, didnt spend $3600, got 1.2 million veiws practically for free as the videa didnt need as much editing or anything, kind of disappointing, i used to like ur videos now they are bad I know it&#39;s a first impression video, but it kinda feels like a review😅 I spent 10 years as a world travel photographer with just a iPhone &amp; Ipad and a bag of Nikons. I now have a collection of iPads about 20 deep. It will change your life if you let it… but you’re gonna need an iPhone too. Sorry.. but welcome. well, you bought it because reviewing it is your job lol Now just put Macos on it.<br><br>That would get me to buy Really Need an ipad, scared to ask my parents though. Buy the 2 TB version just because you can 😊 The new ipad pros also missing one camera. Surprising that nobody talks this. In UK 🇬🇧 and European 🇪🇺 iPad costs 1000$ more in top spec and we don&#39;t get the wall charger in the box 😑 😢 this should be illegal 😂 I absolutely disagree when it comes to apps vs websites. Usually things are buried in apps. Menus in menus in menus. On desktop, it&#39;s vastly easier to navigate. Dude needs to Google surface pro haha.  They did this years ago I prefer website every time. I&#39;m uninstalling as many apps as possible as there&#39;s typically no control over them through a mobile OS. With a website I can block ads, trackers, fingerprinting, sensors... much easier.

It’s not just a spec bump but an entire redesign in a way. Thank you. In fairness, neither of these are reviews. One’s a hands on first impression and the other is an optimistic perspective on how this iPad could replace his current setup. Besides, it literally only got announced yesterday 😂 @@alwinetc exactly Apple should give all their products for free with your free propaganda 😊 No thank you.

Basically tablest are the Meduim option in a fastfood place The crazy thing is that in Brazil that is more than most people&#39;s annual salary Nice If someone gave me one of these, I would love to use it. I would never buy one in 2024 when laptop ultra books fill that niche. Why video quality is bad !? The reason the iPad uses the M series is because the M series is an ARM but ipadOS is really not ideal for a work station... I wish Apple could just allow us to use MacOS on it 2877欧元＝3600美元？？？？are you kidding me？ So does this mean that samsung&#39;s New tablet will have intel core ultra chip or the new snapdragon x elite? If that will be true then competition in this market is gonna rise rapidly. This is a wannabe mac book air with a touchscreen 😂😂 to create content. Small car? Not in America. That won&#39;t even buy you a decent motorcycle Just buy an iPad with an older M chip and save your money. It will not replace your laptop. Just got a Tab S9 Ultra last week and was considering returning it in favour of the new iPad Pro. But the larger screen on the Samsung is genuinely very useful, and the iPad Pro with the keyboard would cost about 80% more than the Tab S9 Ultra with the trackpad keyboard here in the UK - about £800 more (~$1000). I definitely don&#39;t need the extra performance of the iPad, plus the Samsung has expandable storage via MicroSD, and it&#39;s also waterproof. If the next iPad is 14.6&quot;+ then it might change things, but until then... Samsung it is! Kudos to your s24 Ultra! ❤ I am not a &quot;tablet&quot; user in the conventional sense. I use a Surface Pro, which is a &quot;tablet&quot; but does things that a tablet can not. Mostly access to work sites and programs that tablets do not support. Atleast for now. The other reason why I use a Surface Pro and not a phone or laptop is for the pen and supported programs. I take ALOT of hand written notes or use the pen for note taking in briefings or while on the go. Phones are too small for this purpose and most laptops are too heavy to use in a tablet format. So, Surface Pro it is. <b>great post.</b> been on the fence about getting an older (but not ancient) Surface Pro. I just want to know if reads/writes to external media at acceptable speeds. I have a Samsung Tab S6 which works well, but file xfer via any USB still never seems to throughput at speeds, whether flash thumb drives, or external SSD&#39;s, or M2 in USB-enclosure drives, I would have thought transfers would have been faster than it turns out they are... Looking into Surface Pro, this is one of the things I&#39;m concerned about, to be able to swap files between devices from external media sources, I always use up internal drive available space rather quickly and inevitably have to resort to several TB&#39;s &amp; TB&#39;s of external media. @@jimthrowaway One of my work tasks is the reimaging of computers. As I am sure you know, reimaging typically requires gigs of data. My typical image is about 35GBs. I use a Surface Pro 7 on external NVME drives. When a new image is released, transferring the image from the SP to a thumb drive can take about 20 minutes, if memory serves correct. The same transfer to an external NVME drive can take about 10.<br><br>The upside of getting a Surface Pro 8 or 9 is the internal storage can be upgraded easily, as the internal drive is replaceable. They use the M.2 2230 drive size. These used to be hard to come by, but can currently be found on Newegg easily and 1TB drives are running at or below $100 USD. @@SgtSeth I have 2 m.2 drives in USB enclosures right now, a1TB &amp; 2TB. One is a Samsung 980 Pro the other is a generic brand. I don&#39;t work in or specialize in data recovery or reimaging,  I am familiar with backup imaging, and I advocate it over A/V software. I abandoned A/V software over the years eventually in favor of keeping clean virus-free backups of updated OS&#39;es with my software apps freshly installed but not used. <br><br>I have external drives (multiple) containing virus-free installer-kits of all my software apps, plus installation product keys, activation keys, purchase verification details, etc. I have standalone offline &quot;near identical twin&quot; computers I keep to install new apps onto then immediately create backups kept at different storage media for risk management. This is an example of what I described earlier about having multiple TB&#39;s of data.

Lets wait and see what Nvidia will cook in their ARM cpu segment. Finally, someone who doesn&#39;t crap all over every new Apple announcement just to get clicks.  Good job.  A major issue with replacing a Macbook Pro with an iPad Pro is the much shorter battery life (as well as the limited high end storage options and iPad OS / Mac OS app issues that you mentioned).  Apple should allow the iPad to immediately switch to Mac OS as soon as a keyboard is connected, or even better, pop up a prompt to either do that or not.  But I don&#39;t know if that will ever happen as long as Apple feels they can get more revenue by selling both products.  But maybe if they do it, they might actually sell <b>MORE</b> hardware! <b>100% right</b> about auto-switching OS upon auto-detect of attached external keypad/keyboard device. That it doesn&#39;t is just another example of power-tripping corporate <b>greed</b> to suck every single penny out of consumers they think they possibly can.... they&#39;ll empty our lint-ridden pants pockets and look under every couch cushion for every penny they can take !!! ....their sense of entitlement is absolutely sickening <i>IMHO</i> ..... 😎😎😎😎😎😎 And the Calculator 😂 It most likely WON’T be as quick as you might be used to while working on your laptop BUT, it is MUCH more convenient….Also, if you ever use more than one monitor at a time when using your laptop, you won’t be able to do that with an ipad. It can handle one extra monitor, but not 2. HOWEVER, one kind of neat thing, is that when you have your ipad close to your laptop, it can be set up to automatically become accessible to your laptop, meaning you’ll only need one interface at that point to access both devices. <br><br>Honestly? If you’re not too familiar with tablets, I think it’s going to be a bit of a learning curve, but not a big one. I suspect that because of the convenience, you’ll likely appreciate more than what you’re presently using. That’s my two cents/P’s worth at any rate. 😊 Apple’s taking Nvidia’s place again… Wait just noticed they already had nvidias place with the iPhones. Imagine 2TB being not enough storage. Samsung is much better than CrApple :) of course you won&#39;t use samsung tablets after all you are a apple fanboy and one of those paid iSheep content creator😂 Welcome back to bendgate, everybody how is the Ipad air , is it actually worth buying ? Watching this on my ipad pro. Its the best gadget i own. I’d much rather have a thick iPad with double the battery First things first, its Apple, its expensive, im not a Fan of the company and its shenanigans, but i have to admit this product looks very nice, and in general seems like it could be a real asset to professional designers and such. it actually seems well thought out and good overall. that said, its not a device for me, as i prefer more open and fair platforms Bro you are getting in the territory of a spoilt reviewer. I understand it&#39;s your job to review new products but now it seems you are trying to hard to explain your upgrades and also influence our lives.<br>Thanks. I’m honestly disappointed in these new iPads I’m still keeping my M2 iPad Pro and my 2nd Gen Pencil these new ones really not that different and have features I don’t need. Man Apple is genius at making people think they need to keep spending more and more money for the same crap😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Uh... You look like you are really enjoying that smart toothbrush too. LOL 🤣 He is brushing his uvula. kids dont get phones they get iPad Pro M4 The Samsung Galaxy tab s9 ultra is 5.5mm thin and has android. just try a samsung tablet... <br>try the tab s9 ultra or wait for the new tab series, but its so unsatisfying that u always test only apple products.. samsung can offer u at least the same performance and experience. As a 4th gen iPad Pro owner, this thing has never lagged or couldn’t handle anything I’ve needed it for. These iPad are all the same product for the average user m1, m2, m3… My 2nd Gens were great until Apple nerfed the software Thinner iPads with larger screens, what could possibly go wrong 😂 Bend gate coming 😂 I see his point though and I kinda agree with it. I would like for there to be some variety. But lol at your comment. Throwback if it happens Software sucks yet😢 Try use a Samsung phone in the Apple Store and see if they kick you out 😂 Imagine supporting the massacre on the Congolese by buying an Apple product 😒 meh All that to just play cocomelon videos thanks for ipad ad i pad os is fucking shit. If they were going to make a pro device they should have gone all the way. Bigger battery, more io, comes with a keyboard. Nobody cares about it being that thin Yeah I mostly agree although I think we could have both. I kind of like that it’s so thin, it does make sense for note taking and whatnot, which is a big reason why I use tablets what were you doing to that toothbrush??? You lost me at &quot;I feel way better when a product tells me to use their app, than when they direct me to a website&quot;.<br>I absolutely despise services that do not have a functional website and instead use apps, like recently I was gonna receive a parcel and the delivery company did <b>not</b> support doing any sort of tracking through anything other than their app, which coincidentally happened to require signing up for an account to even begin using :| Omg yes really good comment<br>I hate when they force you to get on the app I only just noticed this but when you watched these videos on an iPhone the ratio is so good that you don’t lose any video and you still can’t see the notch. I love arun One day, that battery&#39;s gonna die... At this point Apple should trade mark the word &quot;PRO&quot; 😂😂😂😂 pencil PRO? Like Seriously?😊 So. Basically it&#39;s the touch screen MacBook people been asking for years for. But in a way that makes Apple able to get even more money out of you. With added ability to leave some features out of iPad os so you still have to buy a MacBook anyway. Brilliant. Because you are rich Like your background choice <br>Love the way it slowly got dark as the video progressed I am still using a 12.9 inch iPad Pro from 2018. It’s still very responsive but I have to charge it more often. I probably will go with the new 13 inch Air this time. how do you use 8tb But iPad still a iPad , cannot even get some office work done 😂😂 I say only &quot;Jerry rig everything&quot; In ten years all companies will be on board with the tablet. Most likely won&#39;t be apple though. Ayo that toothbrush b-roll Had to pause at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=256\">4:16</a>, thought,  so they want people to ditch the laptop and spend a fortune on a tablet, then another fortune on the case / keyboard to basically create what looks like a laptop, oh and then spend yet more dosh on a pen, er no! I hate apple No matter how much powerfull a tablet gets you always need a laptop Then 3 months later, why I returned the iPad Pro. Thing is, you don&#39;t really need it. Trust me, happened to me. Wow, that was a long rant. Talking of being laughable, you&#39;d never believe that Google tried to relaunch their Pixel tablet yesterday too 🤣😂 Hi, can you tell me or recommend the e-ink writing tab and where to buy it.  Thanks Laptop &#39;quality&#39; processor, that won&#39;t perform the same. Why? You also can&#39;t do the same things as a laptop. While most people will be wasting money for this tablet, since they do little to use the &#39;improved&#39; processor. It is also not a tablet if you&#39;re using the keyboard cover. It is basically modular laptop.  Use case, all apps and not much else is a waste of the processor power and a waste of money. The &#39;pro&#39; use case is not there for the iPad Pro. It will be a while before everything on laptop is available for iPad. As an app and media device, no one needs to be paying $3000, or even $1000. As a professional device, it&#39;s too expensive for not being there yet. really that price??? Eagerly waiting for Jerry&#39;s review of the new iPad 🌚 All that with no keyboard is a scam So this thin ultra expensive ipad is almost as thin as my ancient Xperia 4 tablet. Unless you can play pc games on the iPad, it will never replace the Mac bro recovers the double of the price of that tablet in just one YouTube video lol (if not more) My last iPad Pro suddenly died couple years ago, since then i haven&#39;t get a &quot;new&quot; one, this one seems the perfect one to get. I missed procreate😫 Yo Arun brushing the theeth looks kinda sus☠️ Bro made a video of him buying the tablet to cover the cost. 😮😮 This is the most high tech chip in the world😂😂 Googles sheets is ass on an iPad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=603\">10:03</a> I couldn&#39;t agree less with this point. I despise having to download an app for every single product/company/service under the planet. Every one requiring permissions and access to my phone, more and more crap being installed, more and more chance of data leaks etc. A lot of apps are just a reskinned webpage anyway. I&#39;ve been to restaurants that don&#39;t have Menu&#39;s anymore and you instead have to scan a QR code that takes you to an app....to order a meal in a restaurant.... I hate it. nah that toothbrush part was crazy😂😂 because you don&#39;t know what else to do with your money? nope. Ipad sucks . I want ipad to be good but honestly the holy grail tablet is the hp x11 chromebook . As a developer this chromebook can do tablet stuff but can also run linux apps including vscode.  Ipad is just a bigger iphone . Ipad could be so much more. not gonna lie the moment I saw the magic keyboard being i immediately thought they have now made a second macbook and the apple pencil now has a model with the word&quot;pro&quot;attached to it which sadly was kind of predictable😅 Where is rick Astley? Being a tech youtuber is basically making a whole video in order to justify your purchase. What about that Macs you can install any dmg / pkg and on an iPad you are limited to the store (for now) But can you do development I mean coding on the New ipad?? Who is the better Samsung or IPhone I look at tablets now as a better e-reader. I mainly use my tablets as e-readers with more options and uses than regular e-readers. My 2014 27&quot; imac still works great! I have the iPad Pro12.9 maxed out (from eBay - what a buy) and you haven&#39;t said anything that would make me want to upgrade. This is a 16 minute video of you justifying spending $3600 on a tablet. Which is insane. Oh i love my reMarkable In some ways you lose some pc functionality or apps. But for another you gain thousands of apps that you haven&#39;t had on your PC. You have now a much portable device, which can game better, multimedia better, weights less and do more. That&#39;s why I traded an iphone 12 for an iPad air 4. Oh and if you&#39;re going on bus or walking in a bit insecure area you&#39;re not carrying an expensive phone with you all the time. I&#39;ve got myself a capable but cheap older flagship and keep my iPad at home most of the time where is safe and end up using it more than my phone. what was he doing with toothbrush 💀 iOS 17.5 is only going to extend life to products that don’t have neural cores like the A10X Ipad Pro 10.5.<br><br>The lowest neural core iPad is the A12X and Z iPad Pro models with 8 neural cores. Who knows what iOS 18 has available for all iPads with neural cores. What Camera did you use to record this video? Your face looks dark i honestly feel arun needs a reason to buy the ipad that&#39;s why he&#39;s making thid video and highlighting its &quot;perks&quot;..   just like MKBHD he won&#39;t be able to go more than a month with that glorified tablet, at the end of the day.. its just a glorified tablet! try Samsung tab bro this guy completely lost any common human sense, trying to justify a tablet for 4k get out of here @mrwhosetheboss you for sure use the toothbrush in a different way Its overpriced af It&#39;s criminal what apple charges for storage on devices with a high starting point. The iPad is basically becoming the Microsoft surface with apples on it instead Why can&#39;t  it be $360? Lmao. You can spend $3600 on a bag of chips and we wouldn’t be surprised. You’ll make 10x that amount from your YouTube video. We all know you spend money to make way more money so just making the title “I bought the new iPad” is sufficient. People will watch and you’ll earn your money back and some. pls honor 90 I can see the 6 month review already... &quot;Why I switched back to a MacBook Pro!&quot; I still not buy it. Im sure you&#39;ve bought a macbook pro m1 that you don&#39;t get use out of. Arun, what would i have to do to convince you to send it to me for my creative work. I&#39;ll do..... ANYTHING If you beat Apple(18.9M) at subscriber count, You&#39;d also beat MKBHD(18.8M) and become the no.1 Tech youtuber. Coincidence??<br>PS- everyone please don&#39;t remind me of TechGuruji or Unbox Therapy. Funny how this review is the exact opposite of MKBHD’s opinion. If you carry airpods with you, you can just basically get rid of your phone too<br><br>You can just bring the airport out of the pocket instead of your phone to take calls<br><br>And that will help you reduce screen time and you&#39;ll only do important and necessary work. Insightful. The “golden age” of desktop PCs have come &amp; gone. The “golden age” of the laptop may be coming to an end, and the age of the tablet may be starting. If they make a “bridge” app that gives the look and feel of a laptop, then that’s the point I will be ready to go all in on a tablet. can&#39;t switch from my MacBook Pro unless they build Final Cut Pro and Topaz Video ai for iPad. Even then I wonder if it&#39;ll be powerful enough for Topaz. my current MacBook Pro m3 max still seems to struggle rendering the video in topaz. As a macbook pro user i think id have a better experience and cheaper with a base macbook air 🤷 Can you please buy me an ipad 9 gen and an apple pencil? i spent $2500 on a custom PC. 100x better than a $3600 ipad. will<br>last me 10+ years compared to an ipad. unless they announce a total revamp of the iPad OS, you&#39;ll still have an overpowered tablet held back by the OS and apps. Okay cool vid but the fact that the view from your window moves from morning to night as the video progresses is pretty cool too. Word processing using Word and Google Docs is HORRENDOUS on iPad With our bad economy now a day. Do people really need this? Let&#39;s see, $3600 iPad Pro. $129 pen. $349 keyboard. ($4078) not including tax and recycling fees. WOW! Haha I am always watching you on the ipad-pro not on my Ultra 😂😂 You cannot code on iPads, so I will think of switching, once that happens :). Bro when you spent $3600 plus more money on a pencil plus break the bank again for the keyboard youre not replacing your laptop. You&#39;ve spent laptop money to make an IPAD LOOK like a laptop. If he makes a video he can write this off as tax deductible so he gets a discount via his accountant. Common creater loop hole. Vacuous. But you know that. Many apps are not well designed to run on an ipad...... Games, and design/editing apps, yes, but many many others are not Honestly, most people will put a case on it, so the thin factor just makes the thing way more prone to bending for no reason. Yes it is lighter but what is the point... Yeah but if something is wrong with your iPad, you would have to replace it whole. They don&#39;t fix individual parts.  Interesting for a company that waves about mother nature every single time they get and even film a promotional video with &quot;mother nature&quot; in it right?  As if mother nature would be impressed by them lol M4 for YouTube and what else it’s too expensive might as well buy a pc or stick with my 2022 iPad Pro Hey boss can i have it? Struggling creative with a very old crappy computer having 8tb is ridiculous, just have a NAS drive Nahh not for me unless they remove ipad OS. just put Mac OS.simple I think that the bendgate is coming back 😂 It&#39;s kinda meh , just buy a mac and a iphone , if you really want a tablet for media consumption get the tab s9 ultra . How are you going to grip it  it will just slide out of your hand 😮 Why buy the iPad when there is a Samsung tab 9 ultra No no, i want arun to physically move his current home to a new location instead of moving to a new home 😌😌😌. You can do it buddy 💪💪 It&#39;ll be the iphone 6 bendgate all over again. I feel like people are forgetting, these new iPads are just the first part of the story. They went into as much detail as they could before June, but come wwdc watch a lot more make sense. Take the new Apple Pencil pro, it’s a okay update, people scoff at the new barrel roll gesture. But read between the lines, a gyroscope allows the pencil to recognize its place in space and addition that will work really well with Vision Pro! They needed the hardware in place before they tell us the second part of the story! What’s the big deal about it being thinner? Or thinnest so far? Most people’s gonna have a case over it 3 words: Galaxy Tab S9 lol, The iGlad Is The Worst One Yet! Keep Em Coming Arun! BENDGATE 2.0 LET’S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=730\">12:10</a> did that camera guy touch the ass of what look like marques brownlee in the background or is my 3 hours of sleep are kicking in again? &quot;while samsung tablets are still using mobile chips&quot; i think you&#39;re forgetting that M series are mobile chips arun just because apple puts them in their laptops doesn&#39;t make it a computer chip Can someone do a video Samsung Dex whats with the audio quality the only thing holding ipads back is ipad OS Hm i can say that that &quot; paper&quot;  tablet to brain storm ideas i could help but think &gt;&gt; Hm.... i do all my thumbnail and everything rest under shower and than then just write it on my Mi pad 5 &lt;&lt; that even thout its old design and not something ultra good pro ++ it is still beast for waht i use it . But boss i need to say for these and all past videos ........  WOW bangers!! KEEP IT UP!!!! Keyboard accessory has the same price as a high-end android tablet with it’s own keyboard😁. No lol a high end Samsung galaxy tab s 9 ultra with keyboard will cost you around $1700 for the 1 tb model 3600$$$$???????? What? I don’t have a good phone (both are used and have bad batteries) so I just use my 1st gen 12.9 inch iPad Pro (what I’m watching on), and I hold it with my forearm like a giant watch and it fits almost perfectly and doesn’t feel too heavy. this is how i behave under 10 beers...justifying my apple purchases into oblivion 🤣 &quot;... Man the screen on the iPad are more fragile than my ego and the cost to replace them will cost more than ur marriage...&quot;  Idk which YouTuber who said these but man when I saw the screen these were the things that were occupying my brain Almost 3.5K for an IPad, a cover with a keyboard, and a pen....<br><br>While I&#39;m just here having paid 1K for a samsung tablet that came with all of these things. On top of which the pen charges on the back wirelessly, and the cover taken into consideration the pen giving a good place to keep safe and not lose it.... Remarkable i really need but it is too costly i can&#39;t afford it😢 100% useless try a windows or linux pc for gaming but what if you wait for the m4 macbook tho? I way prefer webapps to having to download a new app for every little thing Bro I miss your old outro That’s why I like MKBHD and MrWTB. Same tech product- two different views!!!😊 The iPad is on its way to replace the Macbook Air.<br><br>iPadOS 18 &amp; iPadOS 19 will either support this or will give the iPad more Identity. “I’m an 8TB guy” damn jajajaj Excellent ❤ ....so you could brag about it in this video. Duh. I like the idea of a tablet workhorse.  I guess it depends on how you work.  Took me about a year to figure out what software works best, but I got there.  I also like mobile software because it&#39;s constantly updated for bugs, features, design. 😁why you spent 3600$ ? ... because youtube drowns you in money 5 years ago I&#39;ve bought a used VW Polo for the same price 😂😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> ayoooooo Well, given that you&#39;re probably going to need to buy an example for testing at some point, might as well throw in a bit more money to get an upgraded model and use it for personal and business needs after the fact. Then you can find out if it&#39;ll actually be as useful for your workflow as you hoped it would be, or if you still benefit from discrete devices for their specialized roles. Personally, I&#39;ve always been terribly fond of the idea of tablets, but as soon as I actually own one, the interest fades because they&#39;re just an inconvenient form factor compared to phones or laptops. They&#39;re more cumbersome to hold than a phone and they don&#39;t work as well on your lap. Maybe the new iPad Pro with the upgraded magic keyboard case and its much lighter weight compared to previous models will mitigate a lot of those concerns. Wow. Ipads are garbage. More money than sense imo<br>But i suppose all this garbage ad money will pay for it with views eh <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=709\">11:49</a> My Premium YouTube account and my Netflix account both allow me to download equally well videos on my laptop, to be viewed offline,(Windows 11) as with mobile devices. I do not understand the point here. why? because you do not know about huawei highly OVER-RATED, not worth it I&#39;ll put my breaks on it until the first reviews.  A device that thin with a new Oled Tech is a big NO NO for first buyers.  I&#39;ll wait if this device can be stored safely and get no image retention with that brightness.  Oh!!! I forgot to mention with a M4 and still uses Ipad OS with no AI, It should have IOs  like a Macbook.  But still, M4 this year is a clear message for Qualcom and Intel. Still way too expensive for what it offers, maybe in a few years. For 3600 you would get an insane desktop or a lot better laptop. New Bendgate incoming. &quot;People will buy it anyway.&quot; - Apple. How Aaron using that toothbrush is really SUS 💀 3k POUNDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THATS 13K DIRHAMS!! It’s all absolutely brilliant right up until you want to do anything at all with the Microsoft suite. And then you realise that you’ve blown £3K on a giant coaster. Why: Content Who the fuck is 😊spending 3600 on an iPad. You can&#39;t do shit on them Imagine paying 1000 pounds more for 1.75TB of storage.  I can get a 2TB nvme drive for 100 bucks. People have more money than sense. I like how Arun introduces a product to us by telling us how he would use it in his daily life and we are all impressed by it. Tell me I am not the only one who noticed the chair Arun was sitting on 👀 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=560\">9:20</a> why would they last 50% longer if its an M4 chip that&#39;s faster than M2? please explain Some people lack common sense. @@Celixir Please explain, if its a faster chip why would it take longer to load? @@AfatPanda98 i thought you were talking about battery life? He is comparing to M3 on the macbook @@The_JediPenguin yes but if its an M4 chip shouldn&#39;t it be faster than M3? Probably either form factor or its a M3 pro. Maybe less cores too or apple preventing overheating. I&#39;m not sure Congrats. Enjoy! Toyota Corolla or iPad Pro? yeah but the apps are useless not full mac spec Help this man beat Apple! What a load of expensive nonsense Apple is dieing That’s not justifiable for the price point. For that money you can get a high end gaming laptop or PC I farted. I stopped being a big tablet person ever since I got my new phone, which is a lot bigger than my old one, but sometimes, I just need a big screen As a developer, an iPad is kinda useless for me in that regard. No code execution, no console, no good IDE :( wheres the ipad pro m3? Samsung note app and stylus is the reason why i still use tab... Samsung tab is my best friend 😄 It feels like it is more than you could ever use in an ipad. Jerry Rig is gonna have a field day with this one 😂 When something feels like its at a tipping point it usually means its a generation or two away from the actual tipping point. Deffo My thoughts exactly. It&#39;s exciting, but I doubt we&#39;re there quiteeee yet Yep. Unless there are some iPad OS fundamental changes his childlike enthusiasm is going to peter off in a few months of purchase and he’ll be making a video entitled “why I went back to my MacBook and dumped my iPad.”<br><br>I predict it will be a middle ground and he’ll end up using his iPad mostly as a second screen for his MacBook. This video just feels like another ad from Apple I DESPISE ipadOS. Even android on tablets isn&#39;t that good. I can&#39;t imagine doing anything on there besides watching Netflix(yes I own an ipad). Then again, I don&#39;t use my laptop for stuff most people do. Also, can we talk about the lack of apks on ipadOS? It sucks. I watched the reveal...gotta say there was a lot of CGI that was noticeable when people were &quot;interacting&quot; with the tablet Wait until you actually you use it. And connect a mouse. And start to scroll… ↕ And connect a screen. Connect a screen and close your iPad in your Keyboad. Or you want to plug in a HDMI cable. Or want to skip an ad but somehow you Magic Keyboard trackpad doesn’t do the click anymore so the next 30 sec ad starts playing.  Nah, I have my iPad Pro 12.9 (the one before M1) for a few years and tried a few times to actually use it, but it’s just to much of a hassle. I love watching this guy lose his mind over technology getting slightly better when you dont really need this much stuff As someone with an iPad from 2019, there&#39;s no way that this is even close to worth it. I have a mac mini and a macbook that I do work on. iPads are glorified streaming screens. And trust me, I love my little streaming screen, but it can&#39;t replace your macbook for most normal work. Bro is starting a new era - the peak of iPad kids (maybe adults too now?) Eeeh someone lost touch with the common man here I keep forgetting just how much apple bias this guy has. This TABLET costs as much as the damn Vision Pro and and can&#39;t even perform as good as a laptop at half the cost and can&#39;t even do nearly the same amount of things as said laptop. The price on this makes this absolutely hilarious and seeing people like you justify it makes me realize just how much you guys don&#39;t know how the average consumer lives. Being there, done that. Came back to my MBP after one year. Everything he said it is true on theory but they don&#39;t work as you expect them to. Limitations start to creep up on multitasking and the terrible file management when moving files between apps. Me too had a workflow that could fit in the iPad Pro but after the honey moon phase ended (about 1 month after I started) I was constantly annoyed about all the limitations of the OS. For me, the iPad is now my entertaining machine, and serves its work propose when light traveling and don&#39;t want to carry my 16 inch with me; for everything else, I use my MBP. Time for a stress test from JerryRigEverything. Just get a iPad 7 I don’t like that Logic Pro 2 didn’t come out with it. I got the 13” pro version cause I needed a new computer. I hope the software update makes it more laptop like functions. Imagine being blind over an ongoing genocide. <br><br>Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸 Dude&#39;s describing a Surface like it&#39;s something new and groundbreaking because it&#39;s from apple 😂 Eyy yoo on that toothbrush shot boss Ayyyyye yoo pause bruh lol @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> I’ve got a perfectly adequate iPad Pro that serves me quite well, so why would I want another one that’s so expensive that I could use that money on a laptop - which I don’t currently own? Yes, it’s thin (and probably bendy or too breakable), and the camera is finally in the right place, the screen is sexy, but…nearly 4 grand? I love my Apple products, but for people like me, who squeak by each month on a pathetically parsimonious fixed income, Apple is pricing their products so ridiculously high that they’re squeezing normal ‘un-rich’ customers right out of the market. Add to it, their gouging tactic of forcing customers to buy cables, bricks, and pencils just to use their overpriced products merely adds to the dissatisfaction that’s beginning to burn in a significant way. Over hype to the max...if ai pins are trash hows is this justifiable at this price point. Literally allows apple to sell laptop priced tablet sales now absolutely no real innovative tech but a ridiculously over powdered tablet. People are jokes no wonder Warren sold off apple stocks the writing is on the wall. The hopium, is strong with this one. Jerry rig eats the new ipad for breakfast Omg its an iphone product.what do u expect.helllloooo I&#39;m an iPad pro M1 user and Im disappointed that Apple has crippled it. Just giving it a proper full fledged MacOS only can solve it.<br>Otherwise its just a powerful Youtube and Netflix machine that no one needs 😊 It&#39;s not worth it !!! I use a MacBook Pro and an Android phone .. there is a free program called Syncthings that allows me to sync specific folders from my phone to my laptop. I HIGHLY recommend this app for anyone that doesn&#39;t live fully inside the Apple ecosystem Hi Razor thin devices, fattest profit margins 😁 Surely 70-80% profit on the $3000 iPad I’ve Been iPad Pro and Samsung phone only since 2018 (no laptop), I can definitely do all the things I need to do on my iPad and I’m super used to it by now. I would like to use a Samsung tablet but I need procreate for my job (I know there’s alternatives but this is the standard in my industry and if I change it gets more complicated)<br>I reaaaally hated when they took Fortnite off the App Store, I’m still very salty about it. Fortnite on the iPad Pro + Xbox controller was such a golden combo, even better than on console and definitely miles better than what the Nintendo switch was offering. I wish more games would become mobile. Gaming on an iPad with a controller makes so much sense. I read 3000 as 300 and I was like &quot;finally, an iPad I can afford&quot; Bro, replace a laptop? Does it run Microsoft excel? And power point word and outlook? my old ipad air runs excel, pp word and outlook, so yeah Why’d you change the title The surface yoga book i9 is better Ok enough about the ipad. What sweatshirt is this?! why is he defending a $3600 phone... Nah, this needs to run proper PC games and apps and have good file organisation for me to consider it. If I just want a tablet I&#39;d get an ipad air All that raw M4 power to watch Netflix &amp; YouTube… pass Sorry but nope. Until the ipad changes to a fully fledged macos like experience with an accessible file system, it is a huge NOPE. But Arun, iPad will always be an iPad. It’s  kept in its own niche for a reason and apple will never enable it to be capable enough to replace a MacBook. Because you’re rich. That’s why. 😂😂😂 I’ve had both iPads and MacBooks in the past. I love the iPad. But at some point the software will limit, frustrate and annoy you more then you think…<br><br>If they would put macOS on the iPad or even make them have both OSes and you can swap, that would be the perfect device.

Really shows how big of a decision it is for you... lmao $3K on a tablet, that it&#39;s still too thin, too fragile... no calculator the nano layer brings the OLED screen down, because it just takes the glares and covers the whole screen with it, so you cant see them. But that glares block you to enjoy the &quot;real black&quot; of an OLED screen Unless it can run macos apps it may as well not exist. the iPad Air is meant to be the thinnest before the new iPad Pro came out? so how thin will the Air be? Most powerful note-taking machine Arun you&#39;re cool but you&#39;re totally bias and a fanboy, MKBHD took about 8 minutes to explain almost everything and ultimately I&#39;d think he said...still just an iPad and not really gonna change the need for a laptop Man, if only i had that kind of money, i will probably use this ipad for decades before even considering buying new one, powerful enough chip to run most modern game without a problem (because gamingpc tier chip), big screen, Light, can even use it as drawing tablet, what a dream of gaming device $2000 for a coating is Bananas..outright.

I&#39;m getting the 2024 iPad Pro 11 with 1T. I was due for an iPad upgrade. I think you will be pleasantly surprised by how many of your laptop functions it performs seamlessly. I am planning on editing videos with mine for the first time, and will be hoping some of you YouTube guys keep us up to date on your experience with that. I chose the 11&quot; because of light weight and the ease of dropping that size into a handbag, tote or backpack. I&#39;ve been traveling and attending meetings with my 11&quot; just that way for years. 13&quot; isn&#39;t as easy a fit. As for cellular, all of my iPads have had it. I love being able to take and make calls on my iPad while I&#39;m working. It will let you scroll through documents, notes, etc., and talk on the phone, with both hands free to work. No juggling multiple devices. Please let us know if you decide this is doing the job well enough to replace your laptop. just feels like a way to make more money why would someone buy a $3600 tablet? Are no one concerned about burn in? Laptop bag smashable Why doesn&#39;t he add energy to his videos anymore?😭 Its ok Arun. We get it. You need to justify to the future mrs why you’re spending so much, so the easiest way is to make a video (“It’s my job!”). Thanks anyway. Stupide move. And I got the answer without watching your video :) why is this video reminding me of a DC movie I was very confused st first how he can replace his laptop with an ipad.

He&#39;s gives a better truth i think it&#39;s a conversation a lot of people are having. is it possible to just use an ipad. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve played around with and while I think its &quot;possible&quot; I&#39;m still not 100% sure. I&#39;d love to get ahold of a new ipad with at least an m series chip to just kinda tryout for a week or two. Nothing better than a alienware laptop with slapped linux distro ubuntu Business expense written off against the Youtube channel revenue. Hasn’t cost you a penny 😂 The ting with the files Apple even allows you to add your desktop folder to your iPad and iPhone files app (It takes up iCloud storage then) I find this even better then airdrop because in stead of rightclick&gt;share&gt;airdrop&gt;ipad+the wait time I just drag and drop the files on my desktop This might even work with the download folder but I never tried it Apple could have easily put mac os on Ipad, but they&#39;d never do that. Excuse me for stating the obvious. I’m really trying to justify buying it, but I can’t. I fail to see the advantages of video editing on iPad than on a MacBook Pro. <br><br>I’m sure it’s cool for watching content, but for my work, I can’t justify spending 2.5 K. <br><br>Anyone has experience using Final Cut on this?

Anyone notice the wallpaper says pro You won’t need a whole new cellular contract for an iPad—you just need to add it to your current contract as an extra line for $10-15/mo.

But if it takes $3000 to replace a $700 laptop and still be able to do less ultimately (because apps) then it&#39;s never going to replace anything. It&#39;s only useful if you have thousands of dollars to throw on a selected number of specific apps and your &quot;productivity&quot; doesn&#39;t lie outside it Despite the iPad pro getting the M4 chip &amp; OLED screen, removing the ultra wide camera and bumping the price up by $200-300 still feels like a little too much. And considering you would have to buy more Apple hardware and software to fully utilize the product, I dont feel like this should be recommended to the average consumer under any circumstances anymore... Almost nobody actually needs the M4 iPad pro. It&#39;s ridiculously overpowered but can&#39;t run a proper OS. Very weird product \\u2060@@WhitchelslovYou’re forgetting about the actual differences between iOS and android, where a Samsung needs 16gb of ram an Apple product can match it with 4gb of ram due to its system being precisely optimized for it. Android on the other hand is open source and is not optimized for any phone in particular. Also with the hardware part: Did you watch the complete video? Samsung still uses PHONE chips which are much worse than a m4 chip. Therefore your comment doesn’t make much sense.

Samsung phones use ARM-processors, which is what the whole Apple M-series of chips <i>was originally inspired from.</i> Go ahead, look up the evolution of where M4 &amp; M-series chips in general originated from. ARM-processors, which yes are used in Samsung phones. An Apple M4 is the latest version of its predecessor the M1 which is when apple decided to switch its MacBook Pro&#39;s regular cpu processors for what now is called M-series, which is effectively Apple&#39;s proprietary own in-house version of ARM-processor technology. I think ur comparison between 16gb Samsung to 4gb Apple would be more applicable if it were referring to Windows using INTEL or AMD pentium cpu based 11-22nm architectures  vs Apple&#39;s M-series processors which have continuously gotten smaller &amp; smaller 5nm 3nm... that&#39;s where ur ratio&#39;s were correct in 4:1 more efficient but it&#39;s not between Samsung phones and M-series, it&#39;s between nm-architecture sizes between conventional X86/X64 chips that use larger &amp; more complicated instruction sets which runs slower versus ARM-chips which break down instruction sets into smaller simpler pieces, ARM processes each much faster while generating far less heat, and requires less nm-architecture space to do it. Only exceptionally high-end complex equation math in specially made computers, in fields like aerospace engineering or high-tech medical molecular-level scientific study, justifies the use of complicated-instruction-set processing larger nm-architecture, it was determined. Even what seems like demanding apps like gaming or video-editing can be done much faster with simple-instruction-set instead of complicated-instruction-set processing. It&#39;s smaller, faster, less heat, it&#39;s a cpu-processing technology, not a Samsung phone vs any Apple product. That distinction needs absolutely to be clarified, no offense. \\u200b\\u200b@@davi_is_randomlool glad somebody said that people do your own damn research and stop feeding off bias reviews and such gonna spending almost 3k on a tablet and your first when u have a full fledged MacBook but your can&#39;t do the same things lool makes sense but who am I to judge do your thing @@Fractoide What are you talking about?

Get a Brompton folding bike instead (P-class, non-electric) The economy is so bad people have to buy iPads for 4000 dollars. I’ve got the M2 iPad Pro and it is brilliant. I will not pay more than 300 on an iPad until: a) it has a proper filesystem, b) it can work with attachments without making me lose my $hit, and c) it has a proper chromium based browser that supports extensions.

Yes Apple… release the new iPad a week after I buy the old one… THIS IS 3 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MY PC!!!! it is just a little more powerful and bigger phone that costs way more than a top tier Windows laptop. Sounds like a big 👎🏻 to me This doesn&#39;t seem like a sincere opinion. Who is making the “I’m a very excited man right now” meme? It&#39;s so simple for me just having a laptop with tablet screen that you can detach One, I&#39;m old I will never watch anything past an Instagram reel on a phone. I have 2 iPads, the M1 iPad Pro and the iPad Mini, that I use mini for my camera stuff. My\\xa0M1 Pad as I call it is what a take unless I going to be gone more than a few days. And to be honest it still does everything I need it to do. I order the M4 because my grandchild needs a update before heading to college. Apple is and has been obsessed with thin and well no one is perfect! I learned years ago that my life works better if I stay in only one ecosystem, so all I have is Apple. My DJI controller and my YoloBox are Android but they are closed systems that I don&#39;t really have to deal with. FYI you want a much cheaper video monitor thats great - use the Accsoon SeeMo and your iPad verses an overpriced monitor. I do love the iPad and a few Apple products, but I really want to understand Apple&#39;s fetish for making everything extremely super thin. Just dreaming about, i forgot 😂 Watching this on a 300$ ipad9😮😅 Imagine replacing your desktop and laptop with just a tablet that you can plug into monitors at your desk, and replacing your phone with a smartwatch that can be connected to your tablet. If you can call with both your tablet and watch, what would you need a phone for? You just went from 2,5kg to 600g and 400g to 100g, and unified all your files onto one device instead of having to send or AirDrop. <br><br>Think about it, what functionality would you lose? You paid 3000k because you could afford it.

I have a iPad mini 6. It’s one of the greatest devices I’ve ever had. It’s insanely fast never lags like my 15 pro has crazy storage. The screen resolution is amazing. I’m still blown away when I change from low quality to super high on YouTube videos. I couldn’t image the m4 iPad. I would literally just not use it for watching things could have bought 3 gaming PCs Glad u r still using the Samsung Galaxy 24 ultra! It is pretty sick!  Definitely annoying being so locked in with apple cuz essentially u just want to enjoy a cool new phone &amp; it shouldn&#39;t b so difficult to mesh with other brands.

I place iPad and Chromebooks in a similar category. With a ton of workarounds, they can do pretty much anything, but then why not just use a PC? I think they have everything most people need, but if you are a developer, sysadmin, infosec  professional, data analyst, etc the iPad wouldn&#39;t replace your PC. Samsung S8 Ultra 2022 still better than this even with Dex way much better. Still using flawlessly. Zach is gonna have a field day with this one. Tim Cooks happy days ... Job well done !!

Why is this guy yapping about everything that I have known of the ipad for like 4 years. Also for the storage thing its possible to manage it like on PC lol Worst Pre review ever , The problem with the iPad is the OS is not a real platform for pro designers for example , or for someone that codes all day . is only a  faster machine to watch Netflix and youtube Even though this ipad is SOO overkill for what I need it for I cant wait to save up for itt almost there 🤞🤞 No matter how good the tablet is, it will die in 5 years because of the battery. Batteries die no matter how good the product is. Until battery tech improves, devices will die When you have an PC 10x cheaper than the iPad Pro, but you still watch the review 😅 This video is a meat riding masterclass What&#39;s the ARPG shown in the video? I will be amazed if you find moving from a MacBook to the new iPad Pro anything other than an annoyance for much of the time.  I did with the previous iPad Pro.  It’s stuff like how iPadOS handles file extensions and file system that drives you insane.  Until Apple sorts this (if they ever do) and doesn’t use hugely cut down apps (why?!) it will never replace the MacBook. You can tell he’s been sitting there for a while thinking when the morning turns into an evening in the background Do you think that Modern tech companies have neglected the past tech and should make a universal adapter to access past tech to help preserve history??? Let me guess - they pipe the heat of the M4 to the RAM and storage and think that&#39;s a good thing LOL tablet is the only thing that apple beats samsung in Honestly who cares how thin it is? iPads are such a waste of money and I was fooled into buying one too!

Because you have the money. Simple! 😌 Also BTD6 is really good on ipad. I love your enthusiasm, it reminds me of the early days of the iPad and iPad Pro where lots of folks in the Apple community were excited by the promise and potential of the iPad, but as the years went on and Apple seemed unwilling or unable to help iPadOS become more powerful and fully-featured, gradually lost that excitement and switched back to using Macs. I suspect you&#39;re going to go on that same journey yourself. If they make iPads any better it will start competing with their own lower end MacBooks or maybe even iMacs. I doubt they wanna risk that. The same reason MacBooks don&#39;t open 360°, probably. The premise of the video is wrong:<br>1) changing only makes sense if the product you are going to buy (the iPad) is cheaper than buying a MacBook, which is not the case<br><br>2) If you complain about the weight of the MacBook Pro but you are willing to go to a tablet that has limited software and that is at most half the performance, you could go directly to a MacBook Air that is much lighter and we fall back to the first point: it is much cheaper<br><br>$3600 allows you:<br>1) buy a macbook air that is useful for productivity, if you need more power, buy a second-hand Macbook pro M1<br>2) buy a PS4 + TV or a $700 PC to play<br>3) Samsung tablet / iPad Air to consume content<br><br>and if you know how to search, you can keep 1/3 of the remaining money, have 3 products that will do each of the functions much better than that iPad Pro would do, they will be easier to resell in the future and I repeat, cheaper. \\u200b@@ascended1924which is why people shouldn&#39;t buy iPad pros... it has an M4 in it for nothing more than an inferior Macbook experience. For the pro teir it should have a a full Mac OS, then the cost could be justified.. it&#39;s for the $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  you wouldn&#39;t watch a review if it was boring to watch, so he has to act Using a device for all your entertainment AND work, surely the battery won&#39;t last you both. Imagine working for 4 hrs with video calls etc etc and then going and Playing an fpp shooter game and still have battery for Netflix binge. I doubt. Interesting stuff 3600$ for big as$ bezels is crazy 5.1mm 😂 why oh why is it that thin.seems so easy to break somehow! Never buying it until it&#39;s free, but that&#39;s just cause I&#39;m lol😅 I wish I could make a video that would pay for my new tech and some every time I wanted new tech 😂 this is business done right. The reason we have highly priced phones is because at some point when the  Contect creators bought these devices they would say that they were reasonable at a highly inflated price range so yep Gadgets are ridiculously expensive now But has it got a calculator app? Can’t wait to see a parent buy this for their kid to watch coco melon and play roblox on it just to laugh directly in their face. most powerful device to play games with freinds So its a macbook but you have to buy it again The only real issue left to be addressed on iPad is the audio stack. every iPad kid&#39;s dream The minute all your positivity will change will be when you open an app … and it forces you to portrait …. When all you want is <br>to use the device, 100% of the time - attached to the keyboard.  Then you will never forgive its stupidity.  And this happens with a lot of apps … they should honestly just merge MacOS and iPad OS. use the MacOS interface when using a keyboard and the iPadOS when not (so basically just MacOS with an iPad mode) my 2nd or 3rd Gen iPad Pro was so good there is absolutely no reason to EVER upgrade it! Well done Apple saving me a fortune! Over 4k on an iPad (cuz of course nothing is included)? Nahhhh. Really appreciate the greed leaking to other brands too cuz hey, they&#39;re making a killing, why shouldn&#39;t we? 🤬 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=732\">12:12</a> Şeytan ayrıntıda 😂 Yes we all know you have a lot of money to spend 🙄 this is exaactly how i used to explain my parents why i need a better laptop for school project, Arun is doing the same, just instead of parents, its us You sure convinced me hate the ipad os cursor. and no, most web apps are better implemented and better furnished with features than their app counterparts like google productivity apps and banking/finance apps. also the file manager is just not as intuitive to use as mac os. ipad os has come a long way but between an ipad and mba i still carry my mba because i know i can seriously get work done without any fustration. even DeX is way usable for my office-heavy use case. oh yea until i need to scribble notes. so that requires an additional lighter ipad mini or until the mystical foldable macbook arrives with (hopefully) pencil support. Is this sponcer by apple????? Kind of sounds like you spunked £3k on a tablet and are trying to convince yourself that its a good idea. ngl the only thing this is good for is for games like genshin iPad pro is overrated Go back to making a prison review 🙄 Watching this video, I couldn&#39;t help but feel torn. On one hand, there&#39;s this undeniable pull of Apple&#39;s sleek gadgets, even though anyone having both the mac and an iPhone would feel the need to buy an iPad well cuz why not? But then, I can&#39;t shake off this nagging feeling that investing in yet another Apple product might not be the wisest move, especially when a good ol&#39; PC could pack a serious punch at a similar price. And tbh the uncertainty over the performance of the new chip is unreal. It&#39;s like Apple&#39;s playing this long game, nudging us to buy into their whole ecosystem. But here&#39;s the thing – even Ytbers seem confused at this point and lets be real they wouldn&#39;t swap their macs performance for an iPad right? <br>ps: would prefer a PC over it That’s too much to pay for iPad 😂 just buy new laptop Like to see a video in about 2 month or 1 year... how you are doing with the iPad. The only thing the ipad is good for is artists who draw. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s an amazing tool for drawing but there aren&#39;t that many other usecases for a $3000 tablet. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=758\">12:38</a> &quot;Those blacks are sooo deep, it&#39;s like you&#39;re starring into the void.&quot; LOL Nobody talking about that 2018 ahh bezel ? like wtf it’s been 6 years at least decrease it by 50% What motorbike game is at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=63\">1:03</a> please? Me explaining to my mum why i need one 😅 Ipads are really great and powerful. But, Samsung tab has dex mode which bring way different or better experiance and alse has way more better multitasking experiance. I think Ipads are more concentrating to editor and content creators. Its 3000+$... The conversation is stopping there. bruh wtf lol is that useless tablet you carry haha. holy shit. Nice I will be getting this for my kid  to enjoy his simplesongs and cocomelon :D Yikes! I use my iPad for art but the prices keep going up. I like the. Because they’re portable but I might as well buy a cintiq. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=607\">10:07</a>. No, I disagree; if given the choice I will always use the website rather to the app on iPad. This is for 2 reasons: 1. Security and privacy, 2. Multi-tasking.<br><br>Security and privacy. In their own app, devs have more ability to mine your data, especially those apps that can runs in the backgrounds (YouTube, Facebook, etc.). While on the website (even on iPadOS), you have options/ability to block that with the browser.<br><br>Multi-tasking. If you are watching a tutorial on YouTube, and want to switch to your amazon page to buy the supplies as instructed; the video/audio feed will get paused (unless you got Premium) and you will have to manually resume it every times you switch back. On the browser, just open another tab.<br><br>Honestly, I think you just got gaslighted by the fancy Apple’s keynote. Because, if you are a daily iPad user, who no longer have a laptop (like me), you would have know that the iPadOS experience is infuriating no matter how many 0.1mm did they shave of the thickness.<br><br>It is the most wasteful £2000 I have ever spent to-date. yall jus have money to jus spend on these things huh? Can it play WarZone Mobile? That&#39;s all that matters. 😂😂 I have a cellular model iPad Pro and it is definitely worth the upgrade. Typically (or at least in the U.S) your carrier will have a subsidized plan for tablets specifically. For me it’s $10/mo to have my iPad connected to cellular and also have a hotspot, it also includes 5G and the ultra wide band too. I think the solution you are looking for is a 360 device. Maybe a new arm based windows 360 device which is also light. Appli will not make a 360 device. Definitely go cellular this video is an advertisement Wow, the pencil finally caught up to samsung huh, how &quot;revolutionary&quot; of them Looks like Arun&#39;s officially sold out to Apple. The new iPad Pro has great hardware, but its tied to an operating system that targets Apple&#39;s lowest performing devices and incentives developers to make their apps usable on those devices. (Nearly) all &quot;professional&quot; apps on iPad use a FRACTION of the hardware&#39;s power and have far superior PC/Mac versions. Calling this a laptop replacement is a downright lie. It is still just an iPad with the same OS. IPhone 15 User be like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> So we don’t have to So an iPad with a filesystem(basically an iPad with MacOS) or a Mac with a touchscreen would be perfect. That&#39;s probably never going to happen but it would be awesome. Apple argue that MacOS is not designed for touch. I tend to agree. Have you used a windows computer with touch? It&#39;s awkward. I think as more applications support iPad OS, we will see the best of both worlds very soon. I do wish they allowed you to install software on them from third party sources though! for me tablets are an absolute must have. i use it nonstop. iPad Pro M4, or a weekend getaway, with $$$ to spare. Hmmm. Decisions, decisions. 🤔🤭 Can we all just agree that what Apple needs to do is create a MacBook Pro that uses an iPad as a detachable screen and the keyboard as a docking station with multiple I/O ports? Problem solved. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=386\">6:26</a> GAME NAME PLS It&#39;s devastating for me to admit but if someone wants to buy a decent tablet then he should look at OnePlus Pad or Huawei MatePad. Those are devices that offer a reasonable balance between hardware and price. Apple doesn&#39;t know what a tablet should be and as an iPad user I would struggle to recommend their product. I’m just annoyed all I wanted was an updated iPad mini Sounds like all of these are Mac problems and not &quot;Desktop&quot; problems in general. It continues to amaze me how caught up people are on Apple devices that are decades behind PC. Microsoft Surface Pro has been doing this since 2013. It&#39;s like device racism. The meat riding is crazy on this one🔥 Because 1 video and you got it back lol Now the limiting factor is the OS @Mrwhosetheboss can i please have your MacBook to begin my coding journey, when you decide to replace it with the iPad 🥺🙏. <b><i>It doesn’t matter how rich I get in life, I’m never buying a $3000 tablet</i></b> 😭💀 I swear this guy is buffing out his videos with long commentary often veering off-topic, to maximize monetization opportunities. Didn&#39;t used to be like this... I agree Unless you draw digitally, I just can’t see why you’d need this over a laptop. I’m pretty positive it’ll turn into a Netflix and YouTube machine for everyone else 😂 trust me as of now the MacBook even with m2 is much better then that ... you still don&#39;t need a iPad MacBook is king .... Xperia X2 still thinner than all of these &quot;thin tablets&quot; It&#39;s still just an iPad, Arun! At this point, i truly believe Apple is knowingly limiting its new user with their Ipad OS, as they know if they allow their user to perform all the task like in Mackbook, people would most likely not buy the next gen MacBook maybe for few years atleast. 😂😂😂<br><br><br>So thats why I appreciate Samsung, as it is flexible and provide complete options like Dex mode and other related features, so that user can take advantage of the new powerful  hardware in its new premium tablet. 😊 Google sheets is just too hard on iPad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=385\">6:25</a> What software app is that? Can’t wait for the update video!😊 What&#39;s that game at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=436\">7:16</a>? These days iPads aren&#39;t for people who want almost a Mac but more than an iPhone. They are for iPad users. I use an M2 iPad Pro simply because the field  apps I need to use for work don&#39;t exist on Mac or Windows. They are only for iOS and need the Lidar stuff, the pencil, and touch screen, the 5G, and the portrait orientation. It&#39;s also my favorite platform for everyday things pretty much leaving my Windows PC only for Blender, Resolve, and Steam. Bro don’t you mean £3000 bcuz u are literally from 🇬🇧 And there comes an ad for that same ipad before the video Wow a paid advertisement before another paid advertisement I just ordered the 13”. My fourth iPad Pro. I wasn’t going to upgrade my 2022 iPad Pro but… OLED. Been waiting for years. Having recently procured two very large ultra-widescreen Philips OLED monitors, OLED TV’s in the house and an iPhone 15 Pro Max, the iPad is the last device without OLED. Until next week anyway. iPhones have had AMOLED for a number of years but I was holding on to my iPhone X until Apple switched to USB-C. If you, like me, are happy that Apple finally adopted USB-C across all devices then send a thank you to your EU representatives because it is the EU which forced Apples hand. Oh, that’s right… We already know yall just over hype shit to the point for no return for no fucking reason Don’t swear kids might watch this Arun u may regret the decision down the line after an year or an update.... <br><br>We all know apple used to force us to do software updates in the tablet and phones compared to Mac.... Which directly impact the performance of the product.... <br><br>It&#39;s just my thought.... But I am eager to know your experience with it and ur opinion on laptop and tablet I am an A Level student and it feels like notetaking and my organisation on the iPad is very nice, I can&#39;t wait for Apple to allow sideloading etc other features when they open up iPadOS Sidelining will barely occur with iPadOS due to Apple&#39;s continuing anti-consumer practices Because you can afford to, while us mere peasants cannot. To talk you out of getting an ipad. If you already have a laptop. What&#39;s the purpose to upgrade. Just use your laptop until it gets outdated. Then buy a iPad at that time.<br><br>Unless you can find a real reason to upgrade other then &quot;oh this is slightly faster then my old one.&quot; Just stick with your old devices. Do Apple Sponsor you? sounds like I have the anwer, to make a youtube video that will make more money than that because people watch apple content way more then any other brands combined. Thank you. I&#39;d love to see tests of android tablets too. Just saying ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ You will regret not using a laptop Ditched my MacBook for a 5th gen iPad Pro a few years back and have not regretted it one bit! We already know yall promotional gag talk &quot; it runs the pro apps , it can replace my wallet..m it can replace my iMac, it can replace my macbook&quot; when it all essentially does the same ..m blah blah blah &quot;Gaming is better on iPad&quot; 😂😂😂<br><br>Show me Cyberpunk using Ultra graphics on this &quot;Beast Gaming Machine&quot; if it even has it and compare that to an equally priced PC!!! L channel, L guy you can&#39;t access external ssd/hdd because off how suck the format is that nano coating thing is nowhere near as good as the anti reflective coating on the s24 ultra Who else has noticed that Arun has REALLY cut down on using text every 2 minutes?<br>The texts were fun and nice buh I guess he found a reason in the analytics to limit it now... 🙂 Can anyone shed any info on the writing tablet at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=125\">2:05</a>??? Thanks Stop spreading miss information that the iPad can replace a laptop. It can now, it can replace a Mac but it can&#39;t replace a Windows laptop. Gucci parfum Buy it try and and then bring it back. I can buy 2 Royal Enfield bikes with that money. Great review. Didn&#39;t see any big changes. To me, the reasons not to buy an iPad stayed the same I’ve had a lot of these thoughts also arun. It’s a tantalizing idea but in practice MacBooks and pcs in general are just way more flexible. It’s a good companion to my laptop but it’s not a replacement. guys if u want it buy the mac air version of the same chip As someone who owns an iPad Pro and uses it for school with the Apple Pencil. I feel as if the iPad is a good “middle ground” for a lot of people. Being able to use my iPad for taking notes while also using it for other purposes instead of having to use 2 separate devices is really helpful. However there are some instances where I have to still use a laptop and I feel like Apple is trying to eliminate the need for 2 devices with these significant performance upgrades. In my opinion, the only real reason to still buy an iPad even after the new release is if you are going to use the Apple Pencil on a regular basis. Expensive and piece of shit, and yall still buy them like they better than the regular ipad Trust me you don’t want to use the iPad app for google docs and sheets. They are very limited! Because it&#39;s your job Imagine a kid dropping this and getting a bunch of cheetoh dust on it 😅 I love mrwhoestehboss Guys dont forget to subscribe to Arun since we need the video of him making the world&#39;s biggest and best iPhone <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=756\">12:36</a> I was not looking at the screen and your wording about the screen made me jump from my chair Still going for the cheapest iPad 🎉 which is no longer cheaper anymore 😅doing a free publicity for apple 😂 @mr arun and dhrisha ......wedding video plz 😁😌 perfect adhd machine now i can play 4 youtube videos and 2 4k movies at once Arun obviously alienated the developers watching the video 😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> ... is there calculator in that ipad Imagine someone trying hard to convince.. No hate but it&#39;s visible file manager nice toothbrush yes Who needs thin tablets? 3000$ for iPad 😮 you are rich pro max 😂<br>I can’t even afford the Magic Keyboard for my iPad Pro 😂 It’s fun watching meehostheboss discover the iPad for the first time. Like he’s mainly excited about things iPad has done for a long time. Welcome! 3k broo Apple keyboard is £350  and on the other hand Xiaomi making tabs for $299 !!! I have a phone that is worth $200 - an absolute beast. 256GB storage (more then I could ever fill up) a PC - mid ranger (CPU - Ryzen 5500, GPU - AMD Radeon RX6600, 500GB Nvme M.2 storage and 2TB SSD, 16GB DDR4 ram) but still, min of 100fps on games and averages of as high as 250 for $600 + $60 for a display(22 inches full hd 100hz) + $50 for a keyboard. My laptop costs Abt $300 pretty good specs as well. I also have 3 pairs of headphones around $100 together+ SmartTV $350 + my Fing Piano if you want another $500. This ALL TOGETHER is $2160... The tablet is how much again?! $3600?! Yeah no I ain&#39;t buying this shit.       <br><br>TLDR: My whole setup(a lot of things - $2160. 1 Ipad - $3600 Someone is going to say &quot;oh a piano can&#39;t be bought for that cheap&quot;. Well it is an old communist mass produced piano it was bought for $150 like 30 years ago so I would say it is not even worth the 500 I gave it So 3600 from apple doesn&#39;t get you a flawless experience<br>Apple fans would say its part of the experiencexD Will it also bent when you hold it a little too firm? Asking for a friend of course. I would like to buy a $3000 car Ever since the MacBooks switched to Apple Silicon and Final Cut Pro app dropped for iPad, I&#39;d get the iPad Pro instead, better value for money, only thing I&#39;d pay more for is storage ofc, like specing it with 1TB of storage. Galaxy S9 ultra tablet better [in my opinion]😊 Still waste of money to buy Prediction: In six weeks time, Arun will make a video explaining why we was wrong to switch from his MacBook. A whole video to convince yourself to buy a ridiculous expensive tablet + keyboard case for pro users while needing it for doing things my old grand mother would do on her iPad gen 6 😁😄 The way u are using ur tooth brush is giving wrong ideas 😅 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> I will be buying the ipad pro 13. I have been holding onto the ipad air first generation for to long. You spent 3000$ on a tablet that has a name sounding like a feminine hygiene product? 🤣Stunning improvements in hardware notwithstanding, that  exhilaration over his never-seen-before &quot;tablet&quot; has been felt by Microsoft Surface Pro owners since around 2015--when the third iteration Surface Pro 3 was released. Speaking firsthand as an owner of five such devices: the original Surface Pro (SP1), the SP3, the SP7, and a Surface Go (SG1) and SG4. APPLE BEING APPLE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥🗣🗣🗣🗣 Finally a iPad vid ❤❤ Same 12 mp camera than the other tablets 😵 I just bought a Ipad pro 11 4 inch :( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=928\">15:28</a> You&#39;re gonna miss the File System Organization a lot, I mean disabling-ly lot! This has to be Arun&#39;s personal opinion for his own usage, as this is just too much power and cost for the average &#39;tablet&#39; user. MKBHD&#39;s review of the iPad resonates more with me as a casual tablet user. I&#39;m 9 mins 56 seconds in, and dang ARUN.... &quot;filthy casuals&quot; LOL! Somebody tell this guy about the onyx boox note air3c to replace his remarkable. He can do alot in that The tech space will always have different stages of development, so that means we will have different uses for different products. Apple has been smart about this. I have a iPhone, iPad, iMac and a Chromebook (Apple user since 1982. Apple owner since 1986).  If you have several devices, you&#39;ll find different uses for them. I use the phone primarily for phone calls and texting (more texting than calls). The iPad is my go to device at home. Media consumption, email, texting, mostly. The chromebook is for writing on the road or away from my office setup at home. Each device has come to fill a comfortable niche in my life. I think Apple realizes that we&#39;re not at the point in hardware/software development where one device works well for all use cases. It&#39;s a balancing act, not always handled well (see the disastrous Apple product line in the 1990s). The world has become pretty well integrated into and dependent upon internet/digital connections over the last 25 years. I feel for most people who only have a phone to connect with the world. Depending on what they need to do, they operate at a distinct disadvantage. I think Apple could do more to provide a robust secondary/refurbish market at a lower price point for slightly older products. i really like the aspect ratio of this video ❤❤❤ Well don&#39;t watch it in on the iPad because it&#39;s the wrong ratio for video And more... that not you Aron, and as well not Marques arent talking about neither... (M3 Chip issue) Because you are rich.. probably would say bad with money as well though probably you paid for it just by posting this video. Bro you’re a millionaire. Just buy it already 😂😂. wtf are you talking about you don’t want to add another cellular bill?  😂😂😂. I find the hiding interesting from Apple that they had issues with the M3 Chips which cant be solved by software because it is Hardware based and how proud they are to jump from M2-M4... but with the wrong reason...<br><br>“Researchers have discovered a new unpatchable security flaw that can break encryption on the best MacBooks if exploited by an attacker...<br>Its about the M3 Chips... If you think the iPad is a laptop replacement you&#39;re out of your mind. Rich Gen alpha iPad kids after watching this video be like:<br><br>“All my fellas” 🎵 Great advert It would be great if Apple Sponsored this video 😊 ipad pro is slowly becoming a touch screen macbook Spending 2k to use it for gaming. wait until we see the &quot;bend test&quot; 😂 Nobody wanted it to be thinner. Bendgate 2024. Can&#39;t wait for Zack to get his hands on it Nice promotion, ₹5 credited to bank Great 😅 apple glazer Well, if ultimate convenience and portability is the goal, I guess that fits the bill.  As a Windows PC guy myself, I wouldn&#39;t be able to replace my laptop experience as seamlessly as a MacBook user could with an iPad but it&#39;d be nice if I could.  $3600 is pretty ridiculous though. Every review says that the M4 its not a needed upgrade and that a M1 could have done the same in 90% of cases. So, why Android Tablets with phone chips (that have gotten as powerful as a M1 Pro.) should be a problem? I swore they said Final Cut, and Logic Pro 2, meaning only Logic Pro was the 2 👀 Switching between apps is a nightmare, tried using an ipad as a computer for 2 weeks, horrendous experience. Went back to my MacBook so fast. Can’t download torrents I just want an OLED panel, maybe the pen, LIDAR for 3D art and kickstarting 3D printing, and that&#39;s it...<br>and that&#39;s $1000 right there.<br><br>Why doesn&#39;t the Air at least have the 120Hz refresh rate 😭 So, if you wanna use the iPad as a Mac you have to buy a magic keyboard, and a pen just to have it as a more expensive less powerful version of the Mac. Yeah cool nice shirt you are wearing. can you tell me what shirt is that? How little he knows that apps are different for iPhone and iPad lmao You think 10 years ago was the first PC years wth Bend gate but more easier. I bought mine the minute the event ended. I use my M2 iPad Pro all day every day for school. I&#39;m a college student, about to end year two of eight. I will be using an iPad for a long time. I couldn&#39;t care less about new iPhones or MacBooks, but I&#39;ve been stoked on this new iPad since I found out about it! All of my textbooks are on my iPad in PDF form, I do all of my assignments on my iPad, take all my notes... instead of packing around a 50 lbs backpack, I carry an iPad &amp; Apple Pencil. It&#39;s revolutionary as a student. <br>But! I would have rather have had more battery than &quot;the thinnest Apple product ever.&quot;  That&#39;s my big complaint. Waiting for jerryrigeverything 😅 bro shifted from a tech youtuber  to a lifestyle youtuber 😅 Bixby multitasking 😅 its an iPad you realize that I cant code on it.  So why use it ? Why do we even let Apple be a company? If it was a company in the EU, they&#39;d have shut it down already Crazy. Now my Tab S9U feels thick as a brick with whole 5.5mm thickness.<br>So 0.4mm od the thickness for 2+k$.<br>Apple again reinvented the wheel and every shill reviewer is gushing in pleasure. No pc gaming game creating and so much more windows is the best That&#39;s a apple pc price pine apple pen Original Title: iPad Pro M4 Hands on - Why I just bought it. Dont see a difference<br>My iPad whenever it goes 120fps it overheats after an hour<br>I got the last version and I don’t think the new one can fix that issue Eventually oled in the air 🤞 LOL. Overpriced and stupid vain glory item? Nope only idiots will buy this Perfect mobile gaming device 😎 What is that game at 7.12 That&#39;s one expensive cutting board try tab s9 ultra Just wondering if this video is sponsored by Apple I have to mention that as a designer/artist who is upgrading to this tablet with a tradein, I&#39;m getting the 1200eur 13&quot;, 512gb wifi model. I can knock off half of it with a trade in, and it pays for itself in about a week/fortnight, so its definitely worth it for me. The 3k version is a little nuts though, I just can&#39;t justify it for myself in any way. It&#39;s nothing more than a portable mini cintiq (tho now with better features than a cintiq imho). because you have too much money bro. thats why you are buying it. that and you have the discipline of a child. Apple needs to take a note from Samsung’s DEX and just make a button that flips to MacOS. Watching this nice piece of electronic on my GREAT Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 plus OLED-SCREEN 😅 ... Re-- Design? Arun, you missed the mark with this one in my opinion. I feel like this video is more of an excuse for you, personally, to get an ipad. iPad hardware is stopped by its software. It is not there yet. I have never spent more than 80 dollars on any kind of device Oof, I wasn&#39;t expecting to hear someone wanting to move to apps. I&#39;m post-app, because they will all be non-functional in a few years because the associated services are gone, or their servers have been breached and your data is out there. it doesn&#39;t have a calculator!!! 😔 Why do influencers want us to believe that their tech purchases are “spontaneous” I thought in EU, everything is free, so you have unlimited cash to buy whatever you like? <br>Joke aside, I&#39;m excited for the new ipad pro. It works perfectly for tethering with my sony camera for quick capture and the screen brightness is just a god sent in many situations. Instead of having the Keyboard stuck under/to the screen I like to use a separate BT Keyboard. It is more ergonomic if you place the Pad on sth. high up.  (and I have no use for a touchpad). The Problem with Apps is you can&#39;t roll back to an older version without an extra software on a PC or Mac. Apps do not always get better and some are much worse then older versions. Also to handle one file ON the iPad from on app to  another App, to another App is a pain: You end up with duplicates. It is better when you have a central cloud drive. I know people who are knee deep in Apple, but still say you can&#39;t work with the iPad it is a toy ( a very capable toy).  When you can work with it you must have a very good fitting app or an online workflow. How would you compare the Tab S9 Ultra with the Ipad Pro 13&quot; M4 2024? Please do not use an iPhone instead a Galaxy Phone! Please! I spent $2383 with taxes <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a> but upgrading from my 2018. I think it will be worth it. Almost $2500!? (This is including the Apple Magic Keyboard and Pencil which comes separately) First the Apple Vision Pro and now this. Soon Apple will retail their Pro Max series at $1400 for their base model and call it justified because of all their “new apple” features. I thought Samsung’s Galaxy Ultra Tab series was expensive at $1300 for 12gb Ram and 512gb of storage which is enough for most people.<br><br>Edit: People these days think, expensive = High quality<br>Lower price = Straight up horrible quality Unless they change what else you can do in the next version of iPad OS 18, I rather see myself grabbing a 13&quot; MacBook Air for about 2/3 the price of the iPad Pro with Keyboard. <br>I already have a 2020 iPad Pro and find myself constantly hitting barriers that make doing things cumbersome. And somethings are just not possible at all from a developer perspective. I was into having a Linux tablet but found nothing that would feel good and be upgradable. So I stick with a laptop. I am watching this with my samsung s6 lite🙋\\u200d♂️🦝🌹 Can it run calculator tho? samsung introducing dex back in  (idk probably 20 yrs ago)<br>Apple today: we&#39;ve reinvented the tablet experience by making a desktop mode :D Consumers don´t care if they spent 3000 on a tablet, they are the ones to blame because they spend thousands on Apple devices and subscriptions and by so rising the price bar and cost for future Apple products. <br><br>Apple is probably laughing at consumers. waiting for jerryrigeverything to bend it🤣🤣 definitely this ipad very good for gaming pubg mobile MKBHD is a good reviewer and I usually watch his videos.<br><br>But  Mrwhoosetheboss is the best Apple reviewer. I can&#39;t deny but MKBHD&#39;s Apple reviews aren&#39;t honest and non-constructive, sort of biased. But Arun, really judges these mediocore Apple products. Imagine paying 3 grand for a tablet that doesn&#39;t have a calculator😂 Reply to the title Because you earn enough money to spend on that thing 😂 My tablet cost $79.00.<br> I&#39;m watching you video on it.😼 why? Because you have way too much money . Simple. hahaha Day 2 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. I use OneDrive on my iPad and Macbook for easy transition between PC and mac. It&#39;s definitely helped, sometimes the syncing is slow, but it&#39;s a good way for the carryover without having to pick one or the other. Airpods Pro is the only Apple product I own I’m very careful with my electronics, but once when I was a kid I got my first iPad. I was playing on it while laying on the bed, and it slipped off and smashed. I hid it from everyone and continued to use it lol. I regret not saying anything since it was likely under warranty. This video sounds like when you try to convince your parents to buy you a ipad. lol I was thinking the same, when M1 iPad came out and I bought it back then. <br>It&#39;s laying in my drawer most of the time now.<br>Apps are cool and all, but then I get into situations where my bank asks to log on with a pc browser to complete the task... The iPad is hindered by its operating system. I hate my iPad Pro. The worst decision I&#39;ve made on an electronic device. saying that samsung sucks only cuz they use mobile chips is like saying that there is no good android device. believe it or not, snapdragon is kinda the king Hes going to be so upset about the battery life comnig from a 16mbp Waste of money, they removed the ultrawide camera and mmw 5G. Doesn’t seem like much of an upgrade from my M2 iPad Pro. The reality is that Apple will keep you(isheeps) buying their overpriced tech. They are selling a brand and not innovation. Bro you can&#39;t do coding and programming in it Don&#39;t buy this🚮 Love the set. Looks very cinematic you somehow managed to convince me that this year iPad Pro is very worth the price lol 🤔🤔🤔 Shoutout to all the Jeff Bezos&#39; who will enjoy this product 😅 I love my iPad. Definitely my all time favourite device. But iPadOS is simply not there. Especially when you have enough power to run MacOS. It’s kinda wasted.<br><br>But I still love it, tho. Imagine all the cocomelon on this😂😂 Old title: iPad Pro M4 Hands on - Why i just bought it. Now all that&#39;s you need is a smart iPadOS and Bob&#39;s your uncle... Honestly, I’d just get a windows laptop that has a touchscreen. Will probably do most of the thing you mentioned just about fine (and while yes, some will do worse, some will be better) People who don’t like iPads have never used one. I was in that situation a year ago and now my iPad Air is my most used device. Why. Without macOS. It sucks. Lol Phones took git gud literally I like watching people spending 3000$ to replace 6000$ tech that they already have. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=520\">8:40</a> i think oled is still an oled when it comes to reflection handling, resulting in lower black levels when there is a light behind Can’t wait for JerryRig to snap it in half and create an iPad Pro Fold. Can someone explain why we don’t install Mac OS on iPad since they already use M series chip? worst product iPad is still holding these back. Getting tired of Arun saying how much money he spends on things. What I do is, I bring phone and iPad to places on the car I use iPad if not driving and if like I work I use laptop Fun fact: if an android tablet was so thin it snapped in half when you try to bend it, nobody would care :D If Apple ever makes an iPad with a mac OS (maybe even with App integration) I would instantly get one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=690\">11:30</a> this raises a point, why are websites clunky in the first place? I feel like something is limiting the internet and its not internet speeds, because we got gbps speeds enough to download full apps instantly, why arent websites as smooth and integrated as apps? I designed the website of my store to FEEL like an app, but its clunky too! And there is nothingnwe can do about it because it seems like we cant access full system resources and graphics power...<br><br>You cant have a website render a 3d thing locally in real time, this needs to change especially with vision pro Ipad pro or galaxy tab: surface pro is my choice it speaks for itself what the ipad wants to be but cant, what a shame That&#39;&#39;s just stupid......$3k on a tablet. 1.Because promoting Apple products, and maintaining a solid business relationship with them, is an important part of your own business strategy, as a tech influencer? 2. It&#39;s a business expense - you claim the money back😂🙃 still no Instagram for ipad I&#39;d really love to pick one up, but the cost is just not within reach for me at the moment. I bought my 512gb 12.9 inch pro new when it came out... in 2017. First pro motion model. It&#39;s got some backlight bleed on the edges, but it&#39;s fine otherwise. It&#39;s held up far better than I expected. <br><br>I&#39;m a bit skeptical about buying an oled tablet as well, though, considering how long I&#39;ve kept this one. I&#39;m not a power user, and I&#39;m debating on just picking up the mini LED one from 2022, assuming they&#39;ll be a little cheaper now as they sell out. &quot;You have to buy a new one&quot;...Apple really wants everybody to be BROKE!!! can you do development on ipad? <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a> great now play fortnite on it Ipad Pro is my most favorite device from Apple. I use it way more than my phone and mac. Can’t wait to get this new one “IPaD iS jUsT aN oVeRpOwErEd NeTfLiX / YoUtUbE mAcHiNe!!!” &gt;&gt;&gt; tell me you don’t know how to use an iPad without telling me you don’t know how to use an iPad this is an april fool&#39;s joke,right? That toothbrush scene lookin a little sus😂 I personally, hate when the websites try to force me to use their app. Most of the time its basically the same thing only they have more control like push notifications.<br>Id rather have bookmarks than apps that just take up space for applications that require internet connection to use anyways Dude thinks the iPad just became a laptop replacement in 2024, while everything he mentions is already there since 6 years 😂 Eh, the trackpad is fine... I don&#39;t care that it isn&#39;t as big... it works better than the Macbook trackpad.  I basically find the Macbook trackpad to be about 30% effective compared to a Windows laptop... I always use my Logitech MX Master S3... always.<br><br>I need to be able to run macOS apps on the iPad Pro to upgrade to the latest one.  I have had every iPad Pro since release until they switched to the M-series chips.  I can&#39;t justify it until I can use it and not bring my Macbook with me.  I have been pretty close to this in the past by remoting into computers that I leave at home.  I do find many of the iOS apps better than the macOS versions.  But, I would prefer to have the full Microsoft Office experience... I need a full install of Visual Studio Code and be able to load related dev tools.  I don&#39;t need it to be powerful, I just need to develop and push the code... it can be tested and executed automatically via my CI/CD pipelines.<br><br>EDIT 1: You can download videos just fine on macOS... and iOS/iPadOS without using the app.  Apple Shortcuts is rather handy for a low-code approach to it.<br><br>EDIT 2: I have always had cellular on my iPad Pros.  For me, it is only $10/mo extra as included in my mobile service contract.  Super handy to not have to using the sharing on my iPhone and run its battery down, as well, since it is pumping more data through it.<br><br>EDIT 3: Oh, one of the awesome features of the iPad (any iPad)... it can be a secondary screen for your Macbook, which is very handy when traveling if you&#39;re accustomed to having lots of screen real estate. Get a prenuptual bro ... seriously &quot;wow&quot;<br><br>            -tim cook bro tryn to earn the cost of the iPad through the video before even buying I can&#39;t wait until JerryRigEverything does the bend test on this iPad. He&#39;s gonna have a great time watching this thing turn into a book. I disagree with him, I have used an  iPad as an Laptop replacement and need to admit that I couldn‘t live like this. You are so restrained with what apps you use and for me most times iPad Apps are way worse than their Laptop counterpart and there are many Phone Apps you can‘t even use/download for the iPad, the port story is a whole other story, I can‘t have the jerky haptics with the touchpad and the keyboard, I am missing my desktop, its more difficult to use dokuments and save them (the files app is an absolute menace), the OS is cleaner (and you have more possibilities), browsing works way better (you can have addons much more easily) and in general the only real benefit you have is the touchscreen. Imo if you really want that pen and touchscreen and try to replace your mac you should look into some of the microsoft counterparts that offer a much better compromise of laptop and tablet (I for example like the Lenovo X1) as much as I agree that apple products are of superior quality, I also have a very hard time agreeing with their prices. And we the people keep fueling their drive to increase prices, because we &quot;must&quot; have and show off our apple products. You use all the smart tech to compensate for your lack of smarts WHAT THE SHELL WEREE YOU DOING TO YHAT TOOTH BRUSH is there a calculator tho Bruh just buy a Windows tablet with good specs and be happy I already have an M2 ipad pro, and in my head watching this video I was like &quot;I dont want it, i dont need it.&quot;  lol. Also Don&#39;t buy NANO texture glass, any screen protector will hinder your resolution like crazy Xcode... The Imaginations, The Power Of This Tablet, Goes On Ultimate Gaming Tablet. Why does every YouTuber assume that most people&#39;s daily work involves video editing, photo editing, and drawing arts? 😅 While in reality, for most of us, the real value of an iPad is most likely entertainment consumption, making the iPad Pro completely overkill for most, not to mention the price.  Moreover, a 13 IPad Pro + Magic Keyboard might still weigh more than a MBA 13. Or writing, MS teams, Outlook, note taking, research.  All with a long battery, pen and cellular data.  It’s like some of these people have never worked an office job.  It might be overkill but if I’m using it all day I want the nice display and premium build. Why would you want nano coating which diminishes deep true black OLED Crazy. You have GAS First of all good video. But now my experience. (iPad Pro M1 12.9)<br><br>For tasks like writing, drawing, office or editing photos and even basic video cutting the iPad works well.<br><br>A big problem is that iPadOS is still very similar to iOS. Most apps are missing features which exist on their mac versions.<br>Using an iPad for coding is straight out impossible. In that case iPadOS is too closed.<br>Also other apps like PowerPoint don&#39;t really work for me either.<br>The one time i tried to use the iPad app it didn&#39;t let me insert pictures. Probably just a bug. Advanced features are also missing. That&#39;s a deal breaker.<br><br>Switching apps while downloading or rendering something is in most cases not possible, because it will cancel the the current operation.<br>Stage manager is cool to have, but far from perfect. For me it sometimes even led to crashing the whole iPad. 😐<br><br>My conclusion is that the iPad isn&#39;t close to replacing a laptop / mac, but for a tablet it is excellent. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=622\">10:22</a> actually google docs on iPad has a killer feature that you can only get on desktop using extension on desktop.<br><br>Dark Mode. Imagine buying a 4200$ tablet because you need the keyboard and the pencil. THis Tablet would need to be a personal companion robot able to manage and solve half the problems in my life to be worth that much money. Is it just me or are those guys at apple slowly lose the grip on reality. You can buy tools for that kind of money that can let you work in many fields. Also apps are mostly web based services anyway. So a clunky website is what you are using in many apps as well. Creators say the same shit every time a new iPad Pro drops. No, it’s not replacing your laptop because it can’t run the software your laptop can run and without the software support I don’t care if it has an M9000 chip inside it’s not replacing a computer. Mobile games are NOT games!! If you want to play games, then play them on Windows or Linux, and if you want them mobile, then get them on one of Windows handhelds or the Steam Deck. I have replaced my Windows PC with an iPad with external screen and keyboard. but it doesn&#39;t work so well, the external keyboard fails every day, so I have to use the &quot;onscreen keyboard&quot; or move the app from one screen to the other screen and back again, to get the keyboard working again. It’s the accessories that come with the iPad that makes it so addicting. and yet the S24U has more power The push for thinner and thinner devices is awful.  It just makes them less repairable and easier to damage, so you need a case, and thus any advantage of the thinness is gone. No matter how much powerful Apple makes their iPads, it will NEVER be a laptop, just due to how much apple limits their iPad OS to be just a bigger phone UI, rather than something that has close to laptop functionality with software capable enough to run MacOS games and tabs, while also having the capability to use it as a big Phone/Tablet with its form factor, kinda like Samsung Dex and its OneUI OS. jerryrigeverything is gonna blow the shit out of this ipad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=600\">10:00</a> can&#39;t say I agree, I hate downloading apps for everything. Currently have like 30 apps just for pubs and restaurants I’m still using the old iPad Pro that supported the original pencil. I occasionally draw but the tablet is just my face time and internet shopping device at this point I’d be super keen moving to an iPad if Logic Pro wasn’t ass on it The max configuration is 3k if you get the 2tb and everything with it which is crazy. I can get a 4090 pc with that price so is it worth it???? Obviously not homie ! So it&#39;s an iPad. That&#39;s skinnier. Cool. Back to laptop The 5th gen iPad air is the only apple device I own, and I&#39;m super happy with it. That being said, at precisely no point have I ever thought &quot;this device is too thick.&quot; The current profile is completely fine and the new one is a negative if anything. <br><br>My biggest problem with the iPad is the software. It&#39;s great for college note taking, but that hardware is clearly capable of more. Why can&#39;t l boot it into macOS or Linux and run desktop programs? This could genuinely replace the laptop and the desktop for a lot of people, but Apple intentionally locked it down to protect their bottom line. I can&#39;t even sideload on the stupid thing! Very frustrating to think about the wasted potential, even if what we have is still good. Please help me to select from 11 and 13 inch ipad pro. ...because you&#39;re loaded? 😉 iPad should be able to switch to MacOS when ever you want, would be a massive feature people have been oblivious to Apple&#39;s amazing design plan.  Opposite to what Windows did trying to merge tablet and laptop design with windows 8 in one quick update, Apple has slowly been merging the two platforms over the past decade slowly.  Genius really. iPad Pro should run OSX, period Apple introducing a button on their pencil as revolutionary, while Samsung had the button for literally forever... This is Apples version of an all in one laptop. That toothbrush b-roll looked so wrong… Crazy amount to spend in consolidating devices and reduce weight 🤔 Apple sellout😔 Sorry, but iOS still sucks and is the main thing that holds back iPads from being worth dropping any amount of money on compared to an actual laptop You bought it because you can afford it even if you don&#39;t use it I think they are trying to teach rich parents a lesson when the kid eventually breaks the ipad Sooooo listen fellas vision pro flopped let&#39;s see if we can get them to buy an iPad for three grand 🥴😅 yall are slow That&#39;s what folding phones did for me I haven&#39;t missed steam deck in ages F PC level prices. Y’all noticed he’s in another location Bro......I bought a Samsung galaxy tab s8 ultra a couple years ago on sale for $730. It&#39;s the best tablet I have ever owned, and I couldn&#39;t imagine paying anything more. Those APPLE prIcess are FN INSANE! 😮 It’s a no from me. IOS apples and Mac OS apps are not interchangeable. Horses for courses. Yeah, that will change my life... isn&#39;t there a Microsoft laptop for what he&#39;s explaining She from the right state my boyyyy lol 3600$? Nahh my mobile costs like 200$ and has 120hz and almost every feature Waste of money !!!!! Samsung Dex... S Pen..... Keyboard cover with touchpad... All available for years now. <br>I guess you have to decide if it&#39;s worth thousands more for the processing power. Absolutely no way is this justifiable other than buying it and writing it off as a tax expense for a YouTube video… When you realize you’re still stuck using iPadOS…. 😭 Part 1 - I&#39;m getting the worlds most expensive tablet. Why didn&#39;t I know about these before. Part 2 - How I am going back to a Mac.  Part 3 - Apple have released this incredible laptop called the MacBook Air. It&#39;s like an iPad without the disadvantages. Part 4 - Back to the MacBook Pro. How I miss the power of a professional laptop. Part 5 - I took my MacBook Pro to my wedding! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=604\">10:04</a> What???????It&#39;s the exact opposite for me.Downloading a bunch of apps only to delete them after a one-time use Please give me your remarkable tablet if you stop using it.

Doesn’t getting an iPad go completely in the face of it? An ipad isnt meant to replace a computer or be a &quot;professional device&quot;its really a kids toy or something use to watch movie on the go or in bed paying more than $700+ is stupid its not a difficult decision apples ipad is locked down anyway APPLE Junk at an Insane price. Good if your Dad is a Billionaire. Why I just bought it? Because you can afford one. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=46\">0:46</a> 📸ayo I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE THEY ALREADY HAVE AN M4 IPAD BUT NOT EVEN AN M3 MAC MINO 1 tb  or 2 wOw ItS tHiNnEr STOP convincing me to spend another 1000-1500 🤣🤣 Which one did you get? Let’s be honest, you bought it for views! You didn’t buy it because it’s thin because at the end of the day, it’s a large iPhone. “Sometimes you want to sit in a coffee shop and brainstorm ideas?” You will do that once and go back to your laptop and iPhone. iPads are good for one thing; portable screen for your kids (car, doctors office, etc.) Me being kindof technical dissagree with so much. Like you not being able to download movies on a compiuter but on a ipad because one can pirate them. Like the simple option is to just pirate it. Also develop a app for Ipad, android, pc and mac or whatever is so much more effort than simply making a website. Why would somone also ever want to download a large app instead of temporary loading a webpage. I love as you watch sun in background gets lower and lower really cool nope still closed environment Mrwho: Phones are capable of multi tasking.<br>iPhone 2024: 🤐 Currently using iPad Pro M2 with pencil should I upgrade.?? 256gb with a external usb device is all I need &amp; I have stacks of 8tb drives all around.

Also managing your files is easy with for example a Synology NAS. Would be cool of the bring Xcode to iPad, because that would make it mostly pro, on the dev side of things at least Calling it now that MacBooks only got one or two versions left! V12 Apple TV Damn my mom could play Candy Crush so hard on this badboy im watching dis on an ipad (not an m4 ofc but still) Apple is loosing touch with reality.... Honestly i plan on getting one but i am just waiting stress review OLED screen does the risk of burn in still exist and how gentle do you have to handle with how thin it is. I have the Samsung Galaxy tab S9 Ultra. They are 5.5mm thick, and it is on the border of being too thin. I really don&#39;t like the idea of a thinner tablet. I am not a fan of something that weighs as much as these large tablets having squard edges on the metal frame; a slight chamfer would be preferable for comfort.<br>Personally, I paid £1,600 and got the backlit Samsung keyboard and a pair of their ear buds as well as 12 months Disney+, all included in that initial payment. And it comes with the pen in the box.<br>I appreciate that the Ipad is more powerful, but I&#39;m not a graphics designer or anything that requires that power. My S9 Ultra is more than powerful enough for what I use it for, so much so that it now lives on the power saving battery mode because it is still more than fast enough. I can spend an entire saturday painting Warhammer miniatures, from 10am to 6pm with YouTube/Netflix/Audible on the tablet and I don&#39;t use more than 60% of the battery.<br>Plus, it has Dex.  <br><br>What is the battery life like on these new Ipads? With the dual layer OLED screen, I would imagine it hammers the battery because the device being so thin must surely limit the space for the battery? What the 12in MacBook should have been hearing him say 8tb laptop would i have to get icloud. meanwhile im like. i should rlly get an external drive to offload some of the 600gb of photos i have stored in icloud 300,512 in INR Apple products are overpriced pieces of crap. They charge whole $200 for 8 gigs of ram. For context you can get 2 corsair vengence DDR5 64GB RAM sticks for $154!!. The apple shit dont even last for 5 years, the repairs are crazy expensive, the purchase is crazy expensive and the only two specialized apps they offer is final cut pro and logic pro. In actuality Apple is DO*WATER and this guy is ranting about how amazing their products are. tbh why not just get a laptop? 😂 Most powerfull youtube player hahahaha, with so much power that you wouldn&#39;t use anyway This sounds like an ad. Good luck replacing your Mac with this. I&#39;m incredibly surprised a tech enthusiast like you thinks you are going to replace your laptop with this or that you are even surprised at what an Ipad does. I have some other words to use, but i think you are just lying to everyone here. The iPad offers &quot;just enough&quot; functionality to look like you are performing the same type of work as you would on a laptop (or a Mac) but not quite since, as you put it, Apple wants you to have both.<br><br>In essence, it all boils down to what do you want to use it for. As a web designer / developer, the iPad simply does not produce the kind of efficiency I derive from my MacBook Pro. That said, it&#39;s fantastic if I am on the go to work on copywriting or even researching. I probably won&#39;t get it but as I travel more, who knows. me watching this on my tablet that costed 120$ when i came out back in 2019 I can buy a nice car in my country with that...<br>Or<br>I can pay 100 Months of rent No joke (but 1 room tho)<br>with this...<br>and its gonna end up in hands of a kid watching cocomelon only appeling this is the OLED 120 hz screen 😂😂 I wanna be invited to your wedding Aron😢 I&#39;d rather have the same chassis and same size battery that lasts longer with the efficient M4 than a thinner iPad with a smaller battery with the same battery life. For almost four grand just get a 3000$ grand macbook, and an iPad air + apple pencil... <br>I&#39;m sorry, but owning an M1 iPad pro 12.9&quot; myself, just shows how little it can do. I can&#39;t do my school homework on this thing.<br>As others are saying it&#39;s going to be the fastest iPad!!! For watching netflix and taking notes. lol<br><br>If I somehow get over the pricetag, my M1 iPad gets really hot when using note taking apps, 3rd party or not. I would like to see a thermal camera pointed at this thing after hours of usage :) As someone who has never owned a tablet/ipad before, this review has given me a better perspective on the things that matter when buying one. Buy the Samsung. It&#39;s much better @@thewonderofyou1 gonna take a look at it 👀 The tab S9 FE can be a laptop if wanted I feel like this apple &quot;innovation&quot; is only to get more money out of consumers. Sure, game-changing if you like micro-transaction. I use an iPad everyday for work, it has power but there’s nothing to use that power other than the very specific apps they showcase, they really need to give it PC capabilities.<br>For some specific things ur gonna want to find workarounds, Google drive is basically useless. Whatever you gotta tell yourself.. Waiting for JerryRigEverything to do the durabillity test iPad Pros always make MacBooks seem like a good deal, can do more at a lower price NIce toothbrush !!! such a load of shit…. lmao . More useless than a phone that fits in your pocket and more useless than a gaming laptop, yet more expensive than both combined.<br>Let me guess, another 8 gigs would bump the price to 5k? iPad Pro M4 Hands on - Why I just bought it.<br>CONTENT iGlad was actually very good 😂😂😂 ipad pro has a very serious problem, with keyboard cover it is much heavier than macbook air but it is nowhere as a productivity device. I had thought I would draw and take notes a lot on it but in the end it is just collecting dust. Don&#39;t make the same mistake as I do 😭 Maybe Apple designed this so it could become a laptop replacement for content creators. That is free publicity for the ipad line which was otherwise dying. Most other people who use macbooks can&#39;t really replicate their workflows on ipad. <br><br>One last consideration: for children and teenagers, ipad sucks wet arse. It does not give them the freedom to explore all the opportunities computing has to offer. Imagine learning how to code your first mod for a game on an ipad. You can&#39;t. On PC not only can you get amazing games like Stalker GAMMA for free and legally, but also all the tools you need to star making your own mods. And then we have the thing that will really kill it: the excel mobile app sucks wet arse. Arun, this is not new to ipad, most of these commands already available on the previous ipad. I have the 2021 ipad pro and don&#39;t see a reason to upgrade. iPad OS is deliberately hamstrung by apple. Except for niche cases, I find it hard to justify a lot of the upgrades in apple That smart brush part was sus😂 sorry this is boring its just like an ad, bye. I don&#39;t really see the point how often do you really go out and edit a video or draw something or just watch YouTube where it can&#39;t wait until you come back home to your pc or your phone isn&#39;t enough No way bro uses an 8 terabyte laptop Issue is the same as with the &quot;old&quot; ones. I have an m1 ipad, so its already (still) quite powerfull. i love it, but for entertainment. I felt always to limited for the stuff i do. Especially when it comes to file system, adjusting different windows, having the look and feel of a real operating system, having the precision of a mouse or the touchpad, limits of ports for extra hardware - but also where the ports are located on the ipad. When they solve it with the new Keyboard, than it is still couple of others, which would bother me in daily life. Alos some software isn&#39;t just there yet, or available for mobile (phone) but is horrible on the ipad. The apple-angst that you would not buy an macbook kills the device on productivity terms. Apple didn&#39;t do enough for me to just a new one. Recommend you to watch Videos why people have return to macbooks on older ipad models and ask yourself are their CONs also important for you. Because on paper an ipad sounds like a great piece of tech. Just use a Samsung tab s9 ultra I&#39;m having so much trouble keeping up with technology. Stop pretending the iPad has become a PC replacement. It still has a mobile phone OS (with another name).<br><br>I have a Pro 2018 and it’s no different. Apple buyout him can&#39;t wait to see @jerryrigeverything bend it man made me feel poor bro really said ima 8 tb  guy and 2tb idk how to manage storage<br><br><br>i have 500gb on my laptop Dude I&#39;m buying a full-on RV that works and runs for 3K 😂😂😂 My 2018 iPad Pro died recently. The display stopped working. The backlight still works, just no display. I suspect it was because over the years, it got bent a little. I was waiting to order the new pro, but after seeing the 13&#39; is 5.1 mm , I decided to just get the 13&#39; iPad Air. I was really looking forward to the oled screen on the pro, but there&#39;s no way it doesn&#39;t get bent. And I have a M1 Max MacBook Pro for serious work. Less performance from what will be lowest end chip in the m4 lineup, much more expensive, but because it weighs all of a single kilogram less than a macbook pro, that&#39;s enough to justify buying one? I think Arun just wants new and shiny If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that Procreate is an amazing drawing tool, not to say Procreate Dreams to animate, I&#39;d never buy one of these... Marques on the other hand: I mean its alright, overrated as fuck in my opinion 😐🙄 i prefer websites over app, anytime. Light slowly reduced in your hotel room after the sun went down , It happens to me all the time when I use natural light and I have to increase ISO. I was the biggest critic when the ipad was first introduced. I just couldn&#39;t see the use of it. Fast forward to now, I&#39;m just about to go on a business trip, and i&#39;ve never been away from my ipad. It&#39;s gotten powerful enough to do a lot of misc work, and it&#39;s very portable when compared to a laptop. The battery is good (better than laptop) and the screen is amazing. It is my daily driver and it goes with me everywhere. I&#39;ve questioned about getting a 13&quot; since it feels unwieldy but with the light weight M4 i may need to reconsider. <br><br>On the battery topic, even if it has 2 OLED panels, the battery may be the same because OLED is extremely power efficient, since it&#39;s capable of shutting off individual pixels to save energy, where as LCD cannot, and that could translate to why battery life is still equivalent to the old model. It&#39;s also why the contrast is also much better as black is true black. hows life as a tiktok influencer? build a home that can survive without electricity from the grid. there is a Carrington event in our near future. 2025-2035 Here’s the reason iPad will NEVER replace my MacBook. MUSIC. As in Proper music - CD ripping so I have good quality and not streaming crap. My own collection of 500GB worth on my MacBook which I sync to my iPhone, iPad and IPod classic in the car. The IPad won’t be able to do that because Apple haven’t given a shit about iTunes and proper music collections as they want to push everyone to pay for casual streaming. Which I refuse to do. Until Apple actually give credence to those of us who put them where they are - as in music collectors, then iPad will never replace the mac. They removed the ultra wide camera and 3 studio quality mics. Like wtf? My issues with tech reviews these days is that they are biased if APPLE releases a tablet it get its own review reponse but if it is samsung or other tech companies they do not make this much effort i have no idea if its because APPLE is more appealing or what but to be honest they far better tablets then this but these top tech reviewers will never review at all and its just not Mrwhosetheboss mostly Marques as a tech fan I am highly disappointed in you guys recently feel like APPLE has bought to review their products using you guys as their bridge to marketing It&#39;s funny that your conclusion was towards the laptop over the tablet, because I was the opposite. I hated having a laptop when a tablet does everything. aayee yoooo Double check the price The squeeze comes from galaxy pens 🤣 I dont&#39; agree at all with Arun paying 3600 USD is crazy , may be he needs a wedding gift from Apple :) Cringe hyper consumerism What the hell happened to you building the biggest iPhone challenge man i hate apple why am i even here Wow, This is the worst review of your channel now. Imagine justifying a 3000+ dollar tablet and how thought-provoking it is lmao Sellout. Obsene amount for tablets!!!!!.....but people will go to obsene lenghts to buy new ipads as usual. My laptop that can run Forza Horizon 5 and RDR2 was $1200CAD😅, also no Unreal Engine on it is a deal breaker lol. Waste of money When you can afford it any device can become worth it lol, cause shit if why would anyone think twice about a small minute feature or con when they can afford it. Yeah but, the Magic Keyboard im currently using (V1 I assume) does exactly the same thing??? Like… what?? I actually wish the released a physical ruler that is compatible with the ipad. That would’ve been better. And why is it just with this iPad that you say it can replace your laptop? What do these new iPads do compared to the previous 2-3 generations? I&#39;ll tell you, absolutely nothing because iPad OS nerfs any hardware Oh no it’s gonna snap My car is worth less xd THEY STILL DIDNT CHANGE THE APPLE PEN TIP AND ITS LIKE AN ICE PICK SAMSUNGS IS SMOOTH AS BUTTER AND OFC THEY ACTUALLY INCLUDE THE PEN iPad OS ... sucks ... don&#39;t ever think it will replace your Laptop. Because I bought and iPad Pro about four years ago for that. all the iPad OS releases later it hasn&#39;t changed. At the end you go back to the macOS because it actually lets you do things. Just remember. We still do not have dynamic albums in Photos on iPad OS. We do not have multiple accounts. and so on ... Just to let you know, guys, the Apple service center does not repair iPads once they are out of the warranty period. If something happens to your iPad after the warranty has expired, you will need to either buy a new one or get it repaired at your local repair shop. We have a few tablets, at one time we used them as a more portable laptop. I liked the larger screen. All that being said we really never use them anymore.  I turn mine on once in a while so it backs up my information but that&#39;s it.  Some games are better on the tablet but not so much better that I actually get up and go get the tablet.  Heck I hardly ever use my laptop at this point, maybe once a month when I pay bills. this was just a 16 minute ad only 400k subs left btw him and apple<br>MEGAA IPHONEE true i feel that apps are better than websites... but the problems are sometimes apps are poorly optimized to the point where i wonder if a website would have been much faster at doing the same thing an app could do... this is minus the apps that are properly designed and made for their proper purpose... sometimes i feel people rely on apps too much... and i prefer somethings the old fashion way because it would be more efficient... hflee thousand I&#39;m definitely getting the 13inch I padpro. I was waiting for over a year for them to release one I felt was worth it. This will be my 1st Ipad. Very excited Well I was in the exact same position as you when I was about to buy an iPad but I stopped my self and gave myself 2 weeks to really think about getting an iPad . Glad I didn’t because I don’t really have any use for it but people have different preferences and needs. Love your videos arun❤ its actually 999$ He&#39;s just coping on his purchase at this point 😂 My iPad Pro 12.9 has been in the drawer for many months. The multitasking on the ipad is a juke. I have an Android tablet, Galaxy Tab 7+, for media consumption as the 16x9 aspect ratio is best for me.  My wife uses Ipad pro for teaching and note talking. The pencil is the most important deiver for usibg an IPad. If you do not need the pencil, the ipad is of no use for pro users.  For work, just get a computer (Mac, of course). I think Apple will never allow IpadOS to be a MacOS Equivilant as they want to keep those two products as seperated as they can to make make as much money as they can. They would lose too money if people only bought Ipads that could do everything a macbook can. I use a 2012 Samsung galaxy note 10.1 tab in grey I still use for drawings yooo man its actually similar to the thickness of my laptop screen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=615\">10:15</a> I really hate being asked to download an app, I don&#39;t want to have hundreds of apps for things I&#39;ve only used once or twice. There is always something missing in ipad OS. It is not MacOS. Period. Been there. At the end of the day you regret spending so much money on a &quot;professional&quot; device with so many limitations. Feels like vw beetle with a twin turbo v8 That fully specced out IPad would cost at least $5,000 AUD in Australia. New iPads are OK, but what I really love is this sweatshirt! Does anyone know what brand it is? I can&#39;t wait for jerryrigeverything to bully this device😂 i am sad seeing u review the ipad this way i feel they payed u bro the ipad isnt thay good bro mac is better <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> Bratha EWWWW I&#39;ll stick with (heresy ensues) my Microsoft Surface Pro - best of both worlds. Fully functional laptop / tablet / everything. The amount of storage you get on the iPad pro is a rip off it only comes with 256MB starting it should start with 1TB and go up from there.  This is a pro device with such small storage when storage has only gotten better without a price hike over the past decade and Apple is still screwing us.  Getting a iCloud solution is not an option either to pay for storage on a subscription suck and if I want my files ready and available at all times and want to edit them on my device and if the files get too large you will constantly be swapping things from the cloud to the device.<br><br>  Everyone has the same attitude it sucks but I got to buy it get a spine stop buying things that need to get with the future. Balls Madness at that price this guy just came here to talk up the iPad. man all this talk cos you feel like you an write on the iPad. lol Yo… relax with that toothbrush Seems like I&#39;m watching more of a advertisement of ipad, lol. Because thats what it is, he sold out again to Apple. i wish they still made the simpler phones like they used to. i do not need or want a modern smartphone Light-field handheld XR tablet will be the ultimate. You are in for a rude awakening. Ipad os will block you here and there in your workflow If you actually need speed, precision and consistency you will use a separate mouse instead of a trackpad or a touchscreen. If you barely use anything that requires a cursor then those are fine. A pencil can work as a comparable substitute, but it&#39;s not ideal for everything. Lol this doesn&#39;t replace a laptop. It is a laptop. but now you need to buy your keyboard separately, and a new &quot;magic&quot; penicil to use the touchscreen properly. Apple are top tier a convincing idiots that innovation is removing functionality. The website metions all day battery life 😋 Instead of buying and making iPads and ipencil or whatever the f its called more and more like paper and pencil, here’s a crazy idea….wait for the drumroll, WHY NOT USE A FREAKING PAPER AND PENCIL ? Crazy idea right? I know. i personally will stick to 300€ laptops and 100€ phones. (and never upgrade hardware until it breaks beyond repair) Yes, it is technically the most powerful tablet, but comparing price-preformance with the galaxy S9 tablets, why would anyone pay that much money for a tablet? How is it worth it? Or is this really just apple having a mental grip on it&#39;s users? So a 14&quot; MacBook Pro costs $100 less than a base model iPad Pro 13&quot; + keyboard..... Yet the MBP has USB ports, thunderbolt, HDMI, SD reader, headphone jack, fast charging.. OH and it also has more RAM, double the storage, runs a full OS. Why the f would you even consider an iPad. Useless. Can&#39;t run legacy computer software (like medical electronic records) without support and these Medical EHR companies could care less so we are stuck with laptops and desktops.. please put MacOS on them .. that is what is holding up their progress Do a review of pixel 8a He&#39;s officially joined the team as an Apple sales representative! 🤣 If you were reviewing a pickup truck, would you complain because you have 2 kids and a wife to drive around and a truck with a bed in the back is dumb. I would never use it. I just don&#39;t see the point of having a bed in the back of the truck. If I compare it to a Honda Civic, the Honda makes more sense. Or, are they different vehicles for different purposes? The ipad is useless. It&#39;s a niche product, and people who bought them are trying to justify their purchase. Damn you throated that toothbrush Currently watching this on my first-gen iPad Pro that I’ve used in lieu of a proper computer since 2019 😂 I will join the club when the ipad can actually run Mac OS and ipad OS <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=3\">0:03</a> HAKKI ABİİİİİİ So apple just released their version of the MS surface pro... well actually thats very Apple. Please can I have your Macbook when you replace it with the iPad? My wish for the year😍. Thank you With these amazing iPads they better add some awesome software since they can’t run desktop applications I am holding out for the updated Mini. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=44\">0:44</a> looks suspicious I’m betting my life that there’s already gonna be iPad Pro bending tests It’s the same issue with EVERY new iPad release in the last 4/5 years. For a device to be ‘Pro’ we need to be able to freely install programs that are specific to our use case. The longer we’re limited to the App Store the longer this is basically a giant iPhone. <br>Being thinner and having additional performance isn’t of interest to ‘pros’ as it literally can’t be utilised. iPad sales are dropping because consumers aren’t been listened too.<br>If you own an M1 iPad what’s the point in upgrading when the specs bumps are barley utilised due to software limitations 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️ I love my iPad Air for college, but I will NEVER use a Mac because my Microsoft laptop is more powerful and a bit more intuitive with the software that I have to use. iPad for notes, laptop for everything else These iPads are actually so sick <br>I’ve always wanted one for school or art, its like a pseudo-laptop phone Ah following the MrBeast sudden video ending strat. Smart. Annoying but smart lmao DO IT!!! The M4 chip is 20% faster than the M3 chip. You make allot of good points about app integration and design. It does seem like developers think about the apps first over the website! Especially with smart home technology! This is just a video of him convincing himself. Why he should buy the ipad wish they just kept the width but got rid of the camera bump So much copium, This video was just mrwhostheboss justifying dropping stupid money for a tablet Dude has money, watch the video and give him more I have an m1 ipad pro 11&quot; and it&#39;s got terrible battery life and always has.  Funny how Apple says literally nothing about battery improvements over the years because there are none. I have fallen on this hype so many times and ended up using my Mac for everyday use and having an ultra-powerful M2 iPad for watching Amazon video and Youtube.  Not again.....  Interesting video though. iGlad just sounds wrong 😂😂😂 Night is falling during shooting 😀 Sponsored by apple Bro said “why I just bought it” as a title.. How are people still putting up with these semi-professional marketers.. Imma be honest, buying an iPad now as anyone else but an artist swearing on Procreate is stupid. Sorry. It&#39;s true. It will be interesting to see if they update iPad os at the summer event Errrr regards storage, have you not ever considered a nas drive? They literally just need to enable cursor use with a mouse for precision and better compatibility with more&quot;pro&quot; stuff. Than the ipad would attend almost everyone. For the first time I thought I would see in ending: this video was directed by apple, edited on ipad Watching this on my 5.7mm 580gr 12.4&quot; Galaxy Tab S9+ 512GB + 1TB Microsd First take from a serious and thoughtful gadget reviewer about using the iPad as an all-in-one device that replaces the macbook as well. Brilliant. Can’t wait to hear more about the journey and also what’s cooking in the AI department at WWDC. Boooo, Apple boooo. I recently got the previous gen iPad Pro 10.9 inch, 1TB, and it feels good enough to where I don’t need a laptop. I prefer an iPad over a laptop simply because of the versatility that a laptop does not have. Laptops require a keyboard while an iPad can rest comfortably almost anywhere if the case as a little stand on it. I can be lazy in bed in multiple positions while still doing productive things on my iPad, where as with a laptop I need to always be upright. For the amount of versatility I get, I can trade a little functionality, which is exactly what the iPad is. So you wanna work from your bed?? you might just end up like the humans in Wall-e 😂😂😂 I completely agree. Versatility is what a laptop or even a macbook has just for the OS , if your job is just checking emails and basic web browsing then you really don&#39;t need the latest tech for that. It really depends on what work you do. Watching videos, some Excel or basic work that can be done on phone, can be done on iPad too. But not every pc work can be done on ipad Same here @@JishinimaTidehoshi well, it can certainly be a plus to be lazy every once in a while, it’s more than just an excuse to stay in bed lol Why they have downgraded the camera?? Almost everything he says about the new one applies to the prior one too. I have tried to use the Ipad as a MacBook replacement but had failed time and again. So I&#39;ve kind of given up hope on the IPad I am exited for ip68 and Qi2 i. iPad<br>Do we have in new ipad pro 😅 JerryRig : wow its a foldable ipad 💀 Mmmm… have you ever used a PC? It would do everything a Mac (or an iPad) does without the limitations you’re mentioning. At half the price. How could this slimmest fanless body handles the heat of extremely powerful M4 with 1600 nits brightness.<br>iPhone pro <br>And MacBook air can&#39;t.<br>😂 I spent $2900 on my last car used. Apple scares me. Of course casual youtube content creators can replace their computers with an iPad easily. Software engineers like myself cannot replace their macs with a silly toy like the iPad equipped with glorified iOS. Thank you. If an iPad can easily replace your mac, then you didn&#39;t need a mac in the first place. Not worth the upgrade in fact not even an upgrade. People save ur money use it on something better like a vacation. Let it hurt Tim Cooks pockets he has never been innovative all about profits. &quot;Netflix is better on this platform because the latter is so restrictive&quot; is an L-take that will not have me switch to that platform anytime soon! Wow! I shocked when I heard the price. That&#39;s why Apple revenue getting drop because of the price of their products getting higher and higher and get less. i&#39;m good with what i have. New iPads are a boon for Graphics Designers, Digital Artists and Animators 😊 shockingly like 2 year old Samsung: but still lacking Replace your laptop? Rally? Why now? This doesn’t do anything more laptop than the old one, its just nicer. Nothing about this more productive than that last model. The weight of the iPad has been reduced to work better with the new Magic Keyboard.  The old design made the iPad and keyboard combo feel top heavy. That won’t be the case now. If Apple didn’t tell you there was any difference, you would not even notice a single difference between the old iPad Pro and this new one. Also, 99% of people do not need the pencil squeezing technology. The problem with the iPad is thus: it has almost laptop capable hardwear, but uses tablet softwear. Something about this guy makes me love watching his channel<br><br>The urge to buy this  and never use a laptop again 🫠 The only reviewer that is not shooting Apple directly in the heart 😁 Imagine spending all that money right now  for it to be cheaper  after few months🤣🤣 Tell me one thing this generation can do that my 2021 M1 version cant 3600 dollars for a proper high end tablet, is enough to get you a very well, even higher spec Mac, phone, and other tablet. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=141\">2:21</a> chj, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=841\">14:01</a> Happy advance marriage life Arun 🎉 You cannot convince me this thing has more power than a Mac but doesn’t require a cooling fan Okay Arun, when you say “damn” it doesn’t mean the same thing. The problem with iPad pro is not with power or screen size is the os. I use my tablet to watch youtube when my phone is dying lol Why? What&#39;s the obsession with THINNER devices? As an influential tech reviewer, can you not hold Apple accountable instead for majority customer feedback where people ask for longer battery life and more durability for the Pro models? Honestly, happy with my 10.9 IPad from 2022, see you in 2026/27 for a true upgrade. I think that all those new iPads are overpowered for what&#39;s actually possible to do with those devices. I&#39;ve been making music on my Air from 2020, edit videos directly from SSD while have lots of apps opened at the same time. What I want to say is that you want to pay a price of a small car to do what you can already do for the 1/3 of the price with older devices... :D iPad will NEVER be a computer. iOS is still an inferior OS. It is not Mac, and it is not Windows. With stretched iPhone apps that shows exactly the same amount of content no matter the screen size Bro had to make a entire video to give himself a shred of validation before spending 3k on a ipad Next thing they gonna make Apple Pencil air💀 The new camera position makes the video feel way more personal. Like it’s a friend that’s turned away from his table to talk to you. I hope this comment helps <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Aye <b>YOOOO!!!</b> Pause bro, PAUSE!🙅🏾\\u200d♂️🤣🤣🤣💀💀 Arun trying to sell the iPad Pro strongly in this one. Question mister Arun: behind you is it a real scene or a green screen? The reflection in the window tells me it&#39;s real, but the quality of the image screams high-end green screen. It&#39;s beautiful and disturbing at the same time😅 Enjoy your videos, but nothing you&#39;ve said justifies spending almost $3,000 on an overpriced iPad instead of a MacBook Pro, or a Lenovo Legion Pro. I just realized your primary phone is s24 ultra. 😂 Eh. It&#39;s an overpriced Apple product with limited function. Usually love your reviews and the editing is top notch as always, but I feel like this is completely tone deaf- spending 3600 bucks on a tablet that is so so limited in functionality to a traditional PC, saying that &quot;the only thing PCs have over mobile operating systems is the filesystem&quot; etc.. just seems like you haven&#39;t really used a computer before. You need the  1tb or 2tb to get the new screen. He&#39;s actually convincing himself to buying one lol... Waiting for Samsung to drop their thin version now. Would never get apple products. Can&#39;t even game on those mac books. how the hell did you get that Good for you, I think the new iPads suit your needs and it would definitely worth for you to purchase one. However, when we think about majority of the users, most will never use the pro apps and the spec bump is absolutely useless for them. The main thing that needs change is iPadOS because why do we have that much power if most can&#39;t even use it? Slap macOS on it and it would absolutely sell. Even if the samsung tab s9 ultra is very weak compared this, I would take it any day if I don&#39;t have workload that REALLY requires pro iPad apps(Android has good selection of pro apps too) I think you made this video to convince yourself to pay £3K for a tablet. 😂 Don’t do it!!!!<br>- you got the remarkable to be less app distracted <br>- so many iPhone apps do not have iPad parody <br>- So many Mac apps have a dork iPad version <br>- using FCPX on iPad is like the guy who’s trying to eat a 3 course meal from the middle seat in economy class.<br><br>I foresee a regret video in your future. If the pro is so thin, there&#39;s like no point in buying an air since the pro is thinner anyway. The only difference is the price. But at that point, wouldn&#39;t you just buy a normal iPad? Since the air and normal have like the same specs now😭🙏 I disagree with your take on tablets being the end goal over laptops, but I do think that you are correct in saying that more portable devices with touch and nice build quality are the way to go. Most people probably don’t need a keyboard with the effectiveness of swipe typing, voice, gestures, and app design. I do wish Apple would allow macOS/UNIX type OS to run on the higher end iPads. Did he moved somewhere? The studio is different. Man, you should have watched MKBHDs video first about the new ipads :P <br>before making that purchase <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/8gF1Xp_zK8jk8gSDrI2wCw\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=743\">12:23</a> Trypophobia trigger warning ⚠️ Yum Why🫤😭😭 fake ah&#39; phobia @@uhuuehu7863 Nahh Huawei tablet more better from design and thin “Not dark yet, but it’s getting there.” I’m rarely early why not get a pc If apple survives with what they are doing,  people of the planet earth  are really dumb. And it&#39;s still runing iPad OS, still can&#39;t to doing &quot;Pro things&quot; on it. <br>Obsidian, Heptabase.. many app are running better on MacOS. An updated iPad mini with a keyboard like this will probably get my money ngl Soo.. when do we get an Ipad with a great screen and battery, but thin and equipped with a phone chip for a lower price I wonder why they keep insisting on thinner I’d thicker and more battery over thinner I’m a year 11 high school student in Australia, rn I’m doing majority of the top subjects I can be doing so it’s pretty intense study and all that. We use devices at school, I have the smaller iPad Pro and have had it for 3 years. Our school recommended we get MacBooks when we get to year 10 because the work load if a lot more, and I’ve started to see why. Would you (anyone reading this) recommend I get this IPad, a MacBook or anything else? Or even just to stick with what I have now. I’ve discussed with my parents and they’re willing to help me pay for a MacBook but if I were to get this iPad I would have to save for a bit longer. So yeh, what would yous recommend? Not excited at all... Bagus itu saya suka💕👍 I can buy a used iMac m1 for cheaper lol TBH, my iPad Pro 1gen. would like to know if there is actually anything new or interesting on new iPad Pros?<br>I get the speed and the screen, but other than that, my 9-year-old experience with iOS/iPadOS and its &quot;evolution&quot; puts it in the category - why even bother.<br>I mean, buy a device with notion of software getting better overtime? That does not seem right, and is often rightfully criticized on other products. one camera on the back Consumerism won’t make you happy Bro &quot;We stayed up till 6.40am to get this video done, please watch lol&quot;<br>I really love your video, but make sure to stick to your 11pm bedtime! Wait 2 years and it will be 50 quid yeah but ...ITS IS NOT OSX....is absurd to buy a and absurd to exist a piece of tech so advanced jet with a castrated operating system..... Don&#39;t understand why iPads are compared to laptops. iPads are a different type of device which have touch screens. It&#39;s a different use case. I personally love the tactile experience of a tablet. Great device. Good job Apple. So basically they copied s8 ultra from 3 years ago and aaded some new stuff to it and tripled the price iPad is so expensive he has to make two videos to afford it. One to talk about buying it and all it can do and one where he actually has it and says it’s great but not amazing. The file storage system on ipadOS is super annoying. My work around was storing all my files on Google Drive and it was a painful experience trying to save and open files on my tablet. It&#39;s a strange place for Apple to have a ton of friction, everything else is superior to a laptop. Best mainstream tech  guy ever You escaped the bullshiting We all just Witnessed the down fall of Apple How much are Youtubers going to try to push users to buy overpriced tech that is hardly upgraded from previous generation and usecase for tablet remains watching streaming content. In no world is paying 3600 USD justified for tablet. Even if a youtuber tries to sell with 16 mins of video !! PCMR <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=375\">6:15</a> this is literally just false, the apple pencil (2nd generation) had both the rotational functionality and a touch-based button on the side I bought an iPad and a keyboard case thinking it could replace my laptop. Look story short, it didn’t. iPad OS sucks his comment near the end kinda irks me, cause back when i did tech support that misconception was annoyingly common, and it seems it&#39;s still lingering around...<br>iCloud is NOT additional storage space on iphone/ipad and no apple-made mobile app can use it that way. it can only be used as backup space for the most part. If you are an Illustrator, artist, like me, this small changes are huge, specially talking about the Pencil PRO. With a display, make it amazing. But really?? spending 3.6k on a tablet (let&#39;s not kid ourselves, that&#39;s what an iPad really is) when you could buy a decent windows laptop (which would probably have an equal if not better performance) and a phone for that total price is quite redundant. It does have it&#39;s place in a niche of someone like for you but that&#39;s the same niche for the Xperia phones. Yes they&#39;re great but would the normal person require that, no. That being said the sheep are still going to buy this piece of hardware they won&#39;t even use 1% of and tout it as the best purchase ever. That&#39;s what pisses me off, like I can afford it but do I want to buy it, no. wait what happened to i make a phone if we overtake apple youtube channel ? I find that I really have very little use for laptops and iPads though. I have desktops everywhere and their 32&quot; screens make anything smaller seem frustrating. But our family has almost a dozen iPads. The kids live on them and never watch TV. Samsung tab s9 ultra is better This iPad Pro will be my first iPad. Got the 13 inch. I am definitely hyped. I love your channel but think you are off on this video? I love Apple and all their products but right now, I have imessage, signal, todos, firefox and watching your video in a window on my mac.  Can I do that on the ipad yet? No... and I think that is what you are missing which is so strange.  Still love ya but this video was way off.  To prove my point, lock your laptop up for a week and only use the ipad.  Within 24 hours you will realize its not a replacement yet.  Now that would be a great video to see you do. It’s feel like apple innovate nothing but only increases price that’s it Me watching this realising i will probabily wont get it:Hmm interesting Arun you are a tech legend You are wrong in replacing your laptop if you are a Power User. IPAD&#39;s are useless for power users/tinkers.  Great for artists, gamers (and still very limited) and too much for office users. Even the macbook is getting on my nerve with all the Apple co. limitations they impose. Every OS update Apple pushes kills further apps we use for years because Apple doesn&#39;t support legacy software. And they make it difficult to install converters, emulators, etc... Even Windows emulation on Parallels doesn&#39;t run all programs you&#39;d expect on an actual Windows machine. I cringe every time someone talks about replacing their laptop with a tablet (what Apple wants). The day Apple makes a notebook become iPad OS then its the day I leave Apple for good. Still like my S9 ultra Apple said: Your next computer is not a computer. Still..not a computer with ipad OS 😅 this is for now just a really high end thing but i am very excited for when this advanced tablet tech becomes less expensive and more widely spread with more low end devices with similar uses as well! ive been using a surface pro 9 for a few days now and ive fallen in love with the uses and mobility. though in general i would wait for a tablet running on android just for the software freedom that ios doesnt have. Kill iPadOS!!! Or add macOS i still havent used my M1 ipad for anything else than meetings and youtube videos. The M4 is nice but useless in this form factor. Even the M1 is overkill for what its being used by most people. 🎶 Never gonna switch to iPad, never gonna let my MacBook down This video is basically and ad. That is not what I was expecting from you... Pure disappointment. Samsung Tablet incoming. Will it bend @JerryRigEverything ?!

You don’t know about the oral b IO line up? Can I have your MacBook then please? 😂 Laptop &gt; Tablet did u mean harmonyOs from Huawei Screen made by Samsung 😂😂 None of these products, laptop, tablets etc are supposed to replace the other. They supplement based on what you are doing. A tablet with a keyboard will not really replace a laptop full time. A laptop will not replace a tablet full time. Example, when you are lying in bed and don&#39;t want the glare of a big TV before sleeping, you would rather use a tablet to watch media before going to sleep. You don&#39;t need a keyboard of mouse for that use. Another usage is when you are wanting to watch your content on a flight. Laptop is when you want to do some serious work.. either on a desk or even on your bed and especially when you want to type more. They all have their place.  There is no point in even discussing how one can replace the other. im broke 🤣 I’m the opposite of your intro. I used to never think a tablet was necessary since i had a MacBook, but the laptop has typical laptop issues. For example: for years it keeps telling me i have no memory space when theres like nothing stored on it. Ipads are more portable and can do everything a MacBook can do. Now I rarely open my MacBook. Ipad is from 2018 so I’ll trade it in and upgrade. It’s 2600 hundred in the USA if you get the highest spec with the 350 keyboard and the Apple Pencil pro and 2700 if you include coating still expensive but not 3600 hundred expensive (iPad only 2tb is 2300) Point is the prices in the uk when converted to dollars is crazy 😂 You&#39;re coming up with wayyyy too many excuses for this pointless iPad Os device it&#39;s ridiculous. Just get an older cheaper iPad if you want and you&#39;ll still be good. No need to waste money on an over kill social media device. &quot;Why I just bought it&quot; in case you don&#39;t wanna watch the whole vid.<br>- expects the iPad to be thin (why expect when he&#39;s already had a hands on?)<br>- one all replacement for his Mac and e-ink tablet (*doubt*)<br>- Magic Keyboard (using it is similar to a Mac, solid hinge, trackpad still not as big as Mac, not backward compatible with older Pro)<br>- Apple Pencil Pro (fiddly, pairing issues, new features - vibration motor, FindMy)<br>- M4 (not massive jump from M3, should have benchmark in full review)<br>- iPad can do some things better than a Mac because apps are better.<br>- Ultra Retina XDR (OLED)<br>- battery (not mentioned in keynote so he wants to test it)<br>- camera (proper placement this time)<br>- Stage Manager (pretty sure previous iPads have this..? yet he&#39;s excited about this)<br>- storage (mentions he&#39;s an 8tb Mac guy, iPad stops at 2tb. questions if he needs external drives or iCloud. for this reason alone, the iPad will never be his day to day)<br><br>There you have it.

I’m glad someone said it. People like me won’t even look up the newest iPad because we know there’s no way we can afford something so frivolous and honestly, pointless. I bought into many of the same arguments when I tried to replace my laptop with an iPad Pro M2 and honestly unless you are very dedicated to adapting your workflow to the iPad, it’s not as good of an experience as a Mac. With the exception of drawing with the Pencil, which is clearly superior on the iPad, the Mac is more versatile and powerful. The limitations of iPadOS are more significant than you might expect. Those apps that look so optimized often lack features that the Mac version has, and even if they have feature parity accomplishing tasks often takes extra steps. <br><br>I’ll give an example. I use Asana at work for project management. In Asana you can tag other users by typing “@“ and the first few letters of their name. You then get a dropdown menu and on Mac you just use the arrow keys and hit enter to select the person you want. On the iPad, you have to use the touch interface to interact with the dropdown menu which means you start the interaction on the keyboard and then have to take your hands off the keyboard to use either the touchscreen directly or the mouse, both of which are less efficient and intuitive. That’s just one small example but there are a million little things like this that add up to a lot of frustration over time. <br><br>That’s before you even get into things like external monitors where iPad also has more limitations than Mac, file management is more limited, device integration is more limited. You can’t use the amazing Universal Control feature without a Mac, period. Even though when Universal Control is activated you can use the iPad Magic Keyboard and mouse to control a Mac, you can’t initiate Universal Control with only an iPad. iPadOS is still treated like a junior OS which is mind boggling given the level of power the iPad pros have in them. <br><br>I also don’t see the iPad Pro as a good replacement for the remarkable tablet. It may be thinner and lighter but the price difference is massive and one of the benefits of the remarkable tablet is that you can focus on your writing/drawing with no distractions, whereas the iPad is fully integrated into your Apple ecosystem and unless you go out of you way to shut off notifications and other connections you’ll frequently be pulled out of your focus state by intrusions. <br><br>Personally I think the 13” Air is a much better buy. You get the same level of performance despite being two chip generations apart because iPadOS is so limited it can’t push the M1 to its full potential let alone the M2, you get a nice big screen that can work with the new Apple Pencil and you save a buttload of money. Or buy a used M1 or M2 iPad Pro, also save a buttload of money, and still get the nice extra features like promotion displays etc. Unless Apple announces a significant overhaul of iPadOS at WWDC that specifically takes advantage of the M4 chip, there is very little reason to get a new iPad Pro for most people. For creative professionals who do a mix of keyboard based work and pencil based work, the new iPad pros are a much better value proposition, but even then most of those professionals likely already have a MacBook and a drawing interface. @@tamimatharemadi  He is a tech reviewer dummy, tech reviewers do the extreme for review purpose.

It just makes me feel dubious about everything you’re saying. for that money I would buy a pc-system with best hardware.... what is happening at your background something is moving Dude love the Apple watch background i tell you that i feel the opposite:<br>Whenever anything tells me to use their app, i consider alternatives or dropping it completely. if it doesn&#39;t run autonomous, if you can&#39;t use it&#39;s full potential offline, it&#39;s not a finished product. i don&#39;t want one thing relying on the other (except electricity maybe). I’m interested in upcoming iPad Mini and I see potential of making it even thinner and lighter than it is ( with 2 gen 3nm chip) and with similar OLED display. you spend hours making this video (appreciate the effort), but didn&#39;t see you complete the order in this video 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 13 inches is a bit too big for a tablet. Those &quot;big iPad Pro&quot; memes may be making a comeback! Hi guys pls like get to 2k like or I will stop studying It&#39;s fascinating how someone can spin such a fairytale story about a boring tech bump. This channel has become so untrustworthy. Unsubscribed. Then you get a 20$ keyboard compatible with apple via bluetooth and it has rgb lights and all those top controls that the MAgic keyboard has, works perfect. In all sincerity, why should you give 15x more? I have a $5 keyboard, works perfectly I want to buy an iPad, and I have no idea what for. I already have a Linux laptop and a Windows PC, but the idea of an iPad seems so appealing for some reason. Just get the base $349 iPad. Not worth getting the Pros or even the air. @@anthonyvallejo1537 Nah, I don&#39;t wanna cheap out to get outdated hardware. Probably not even gonna get one, but if I do I&#39;m 100% getting a Pro. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a>    😬 So, I have a Mac at home and debated on purchasing an iPad Pro or or MacBook. I went with the iPad Pro and now regret it. It’s not a desktop, websites think it’s a phone, the M chip is not utilized fully, there’s no way I can use it as a stand alone for business. If I were to do it again, I’d just buy one MacBook Pro and be done with it. There’s no way this wasn’t an ad Does the new iPad Air support Final Cut 2 etc.? And as much your&#39;s or MKBHD&#39;s videos look real, at the end of the day, you are all paid by Wall Street anyway i would argue that if you are planning on spending 3.5 grand, ur better off with a MacBook. but for the casual to medium power users, the base or slightly upgraded iPad pro makes a lot of sense. i still wouldn&#39;t think that a complete power user would be comfortable with only an ipad. Arun is soo spoiled, 8TB kinda guy😮 That&#39;s what he needs for his workload, and he bought it himself? I&#39;m in full agreement with most of the things you&#39;ve stated here , more so in some areas that as a creator , you haven&#39;t. What I mean is that , as a music playlist creating , tablet gaming enthusiast ; the idea of having my adapted set/sets of gaming triggers and he&#39;ll maybe even a fan now and then , being able to just break it all down and slap on such a keyboard . It&#39;s sooo that I&#39;m starting to analyse it&#39;s coming probability and almost in the same vain as with &quot; loosing mac &quot; altogether. <br>I switched to the Samsung s9 ultra some many months ago now , in the hope that preparation there would be worth while and I&#39;m definitely optimistic about coming back , after the short break . The cost though and risk is high .... Spends $5K in a macbook just to spend $3.5K in a tablet to replace it If I’m gonna be honest the new iPad is only just faster by a lot but if I’m gonna be honest I’d rather just buy the older versions It appears that you&#39;re replacing a laptop with a laptop. For games, android or a windows laptop will be way more powerful and cheaper. ipad OS is going to throw a spanner into the works with this experiment. It&#39;s too limited. New video idea: replace your macbook pro with an ipad for a week What about Coders Bro! Can we do industry level coding in that Ipad?<br>No is the answer 😕 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=551\">9:11</a> what photo editing app is he saying?  It sounds like he said Pixel Meter but I don’t find an app named that in the iOS App Store. I was looking for the app too. I think it’s Photomator (by Pixelmator) on the AppStore I think Final Cut but not sure I can&#39;t imagine filling 2TB Didn’t anyone notice that Apple quietly removed the 2nd camera from the IPad Pro??? lmaooo all that money to watch YouTube shorts Answer:: because you have money,and, you&#39;re a apple fanboy 🤷 One of the worst backgrounds ever. A man who is obsessed with tech, and the purchasing of tech, has just rationalized buying a device that has sold 677 million units over the last 14 years. 😅 i love watching things i can&#39;t afford Display looks amazing - especially when viewing from an S9 Tab Ultra... ;) Guys, Samsung has been making tablet of this thickness for a third of decade. Arun definitely has not known about the Magic Keyboard for decades last like 4 years. He was so impressed by the new one yet talking mostly about things that are not new 😂 😂😂😂😂 Perhaps the fact that they&#39;ve eliminated better options cuz apple keyboard was always the worst yet the most expensive Once you notice it, he does this a lot. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s in case the person watching doesn&#39;t know about the products or to stretch the runtime. But he does it a lot. @@lirfrank i just think he didn’t know about it at all since he’s saying that he never stepped foot in the tabler world let alone iPads Damn 2018 iPad Pro here. Works great and have ZERO NEED TO UPGRADE. Until Mac os is on iPad im keeping my 2018 Finally i can watch youtube with high resulution)) Looks interesting, it&#39;s a pity its an apple product i use a surface pro for college. Nah buddy, I&#39;m not a tablet guy, considering it&#39;s worth over $2000. I can buy a much faster PC for work. Plus, this tablet is more for entertainment than work. So yeah, maybe some rich dudes may buy it for entertainment, but other than that, I&#39;m sure 90% of people won&#39;t be buying it because of its price.<br><br>Plus, Arun, I think you took too many retakes 😁 because the recording during the day turns into a recording at night. Haha, I had to double the brightness to watch it... Doesn’t look like a review but “Promotion”. Atleast MKBHD indicated few mistakes. There is no BUT...please don&#39;t generalise these amounts! lol you could get a 4080 pc for the price of a 2tb model Me playing geometry dash: Why still thick bezels and removed one camera silently and Wi-Fi 6E 😅 THAT COST MORE THAN THE VISION PRO… WHAT!! Are you going to do a video about your new house when you&#39;ll move ? Somehow in my experience apps are usually so much more limited and less intuitive than websites U don’t need a MacBook or laptop.. but millions of developers, testing professionals, cloud engineers, devops, machine learning, artificial intelligence, complex designers, simulation, cell biology, biomedical, and much more day to day various computer technicians needed the most. It’s just a powerful tablet for high end video conferencing, fancy expensive video and photo designers, content creators, and Richie rich who doesn’t know where to spend money 😂😂 This was a useless video in the way that you could do that with the old iPads. And this is nothing like a Mac with it iPadOS.<br><br>Huge apple shill I’m stay with my ipad mini 4 2015 Non replaceable battery, that&#39;s a no-no <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=729\">12:09</a> da arkada hakki alkani gordum kapatasim geldi videoyu Who dat It&#39;s capable of running MacOS, but instead they decided to make it more like a Fisher Price toy for £3000. Sad times. iPad is good for iPad&#39;s stuff. Not so much. Vídeos, internet, some casual games. ummm you are seated there about to spend that much money -------BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY TO SPEND!!!! I would love a part 2 after you’ve used it for a while U said $3,600 for tablet u know that’s a bad deal Thank you for the review. I have been using the ipad pro daily for some time now. It is never a complete replacement for a laptop but it can easily replace about 70-80% of the tasks. The main limitation is the ipad operating system. Multi-tasking is not great and extending the display is clunky. It is however good for those who are easily distracted and need to focus on one task at a time. Dude hasn&#39;t used a iPad with a case or keyboard in 10 years lol. You might want to check out Samsung&#39;s tablet S9 ultra. So it&#39;s the same old pointless slab of glass with a Fisher-Price operating system which you can do nothing with. Oh and it&#39;s even more expensive. Shocker!! Lame. This is a gross money grab from the fruit company. STUPD AMOUNTS OF MONEY.. JUST STUPID 😖‼️🙄😬 Thats a no from me. Regular guy doesnt need it. As an Apple user, yikes ... that&#39;s 3 grand man.<br>I love Apple devices and their Eco-System, but their prices are just ridiculous. broooo, if u are to use a Samsung Phone, at least buy a Samsung Tablet, better at everything, and half the price. I LOVE Android, but even I have to admit I cannot see the appeal of an Android tablet over an iPad. There&#39;s so much wrong with that video, I cant believe it comes from Mrwhosetheboss. wow... Perhaps instead of whining you could give constructive feedback? This won&#39;t do anything positive. @@mrzeroskill Bro, if I had the nerv to it, I would have done it. But since nobody cares about it, I wont change many minds, and I have better things to waist my time on, live with that comment. @@bluluke There&#39;s nothing here about nerve. Why are you leaving rude, whining comments? You&#39;re just making false claims so you can have something else to whine about. @@mrzeroskill 😂😂😂👍🏻 Ok i prefer MacBook pros, but u do u  ! I ain&#39;t spending 4k for the iPad and the keyboard just for it to do half the things my £800 laptop can do. If you are not an artist of some sort, or a developer of some sort, then this iPad is nothing more than a waste of money. If you are a gamer or would just use it for casual use, it is a MASSIVE waste of money. Why TF would spend $2000 or more for tablet. Can’t use your old $300 Magic Keyboard and you can’t use your old Apple Pencil. So much for a company trying to be carbon neutral. And you don’t get the full capabilities of the M4 chip unless you get the higher storage. What I have learned is that Apple robs its consumers blind Soo one time i was recording a video on my iphone 5 in 2023 and i taped it to my washer which fell into the spinning drum <b>Bending</b> it and surprised the thick glass didnt break. I recently bought the sony wh1000xm5 headphones, in the guide it said press the on button to automatically connect to my phone then once I put them on I haa audio guide, which told me to go to an app which was SUPER easy to use, even if you skip the instructions on how to set it up. stoner @@purpinknI&#39;m Aussie, it&#39;s illegal here, but good response @@purpinknI&#39;m Aussie, it&#39;s illegal here Me and the rest of the commoners in the comments are not the target audience and anyone comparing it to a PC is also not the target audience <br>However the M4 chip is definitely useless considering ipad OS is still the same <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=604\">10:04</a> I HATE it when some product directs me to an APP and the Website is useless. Get off my phone stop stealing my data Sorry but this review felt more like marketing than a review. It is mind boggling that a tablet is priced higher than full blown powerful macbooks and gaming laptops. It doesn&#39;t matter how good a product is if the pricing is ridiculous for most buyers. We don&#39;t want to encourage corporates to rip us off. @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=600\">10:00</a> yep. I quit dollar shave club a few years ago because they disabled their app in favor of their website MacBook with a detachable screen 😅 no thanks am so happy with my M1 What is his paper Tablet called? I need that They are meh , I wanna see what Samsung has in store I watched live yesterday and I knew that you will test it Pretty much everything you talked about is so unimpressive it&#39;s bonkers to me that you even considered paying that much for that thing.  Why do you think apple products are so expensive? Because people keep being simps and buying whatever garbage they&#39;re peddling that week.<br><br>Insert the &quot;I&#39;ll take your entire stock&quot; meme. galaxy S9 ultra &gt;&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t b braindead spend your money on a Samsung tablet or Huawei or any other company I feel the opposite, I much prefer when I can use a website not an app, e.g I used shazam on my phone, I can’t then when on my laptop or pc see what songs I shazamed on their website (I curate my playlists on a laptop or pc) You can buy a discounted MacBook Air M1 and a iPad 10 for 1K and have a similar experience or better than on an iPad Pro…pure waste of money You bought to make a video about it. lol the M1 iPad is already way over powered. Apple losing their shit building a race car with rocket specs So, did they finally release a product worth spending $3600 on? how are games on ipad better than Mac if Mac already has all ipad games + ports of actual console and pc games?<br><br><br><br><br>so how is less games =better “gaming utility”?<br>not even talking about how bad most mobile games are like how is diavlo 4, cod mobile and genshin better than all those games + actual good console and pc games??? Apple polishing cloth is thinnest of all apple products 😂 As it’s been said recently, an iPad is still an iPad, I can’t play steam games, can’t open many programs in the same window(more than 4), can’t make workspaces like the Mac, can’t connect other devices; moving you mouse between devices, do I need to go on? yes, but for enough money you can get a laptop with a touchscreen and it&#39;s better than an m4 tablet The iPad is most certainly not a laptop replacement lol. This video feels like 16 mins of him justifying blowing his money on a new device lmfao but I don’t blame him I agree with this lol. I wish iPadOS was less limited and companies made actual apps. The port of DaVinci Resolve to iPad has every feature I don&#39;t use and nothing else. bro, i was buy an ipad pro m1 when relesed  becouse think that it was be the perfect replacement of laptop/ drawing tablet and to be honest its uncomfortable to draw becouse ipad is small and you need to buy extra apple pencil and extentions for ergonomic drawing but ok not eweryone is an artist... ewen to do simple thing like write emails without a keyboard is hard so you need to spend extra dollars for the keyboard. So for real i dont know why ipad pro exist. (maybe just for showing what the company can do) Its just expensive netflix streaming machine. Better to buy Ipad AIR/mini or the laptop. Even iphone pro max have more sense then ipad pro. \\r<br>Waiting for iphone SE and mac mini m4 You can do offline Google docs. At least in Chrome you can anyway M4 what is it a bmw bro recorded on morning to night Compare it to s10 ultra (when we have one) After watching the video its night time 😂😂<br>I&#39;m off to bed 😂 Meh. No point to this iPad other than showing you have too much money just one observation: you can&#39;t even have a visible bookmarks bar on your Google Chrome when you&#39;re using an iPad... iPad OS&#39; restrictions make it unusable as a MacOS replacement Don&#39;t say I&#39;m glazing. I&#39;m not glazing. I don&#39;t glaze for Apple. The new apple pencil just came out. It&#39;s probably going to be a little buggy &quot;the newest iPad is the thinnest apple device&quot; I already have a 12.9” iPad Pro with Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard Case. I placed an order for the new one and when I found out that I couldn’t use my existing Pencil and Magic Keyboard, I cancelled the order. Getting an OLED iPad only to add an anti-glare coating completely ruins the advantages. Blacks will be gray, colors will be less punchy. Basically you just ruin the screen. When are they going to make the Apple pencil batteryless just like Samsung? 😭 None of this is new from the current iPad Pro…. Wow MKBHD and Mrwhosetheboss had completely different takes on this \\U0001fae8 Fr! The iPad could feature a MacOS version when slapped on with the Magic Keyboard or connected to an external monitor. At least for the 2 highest storage specs 1 and 2 TB.<br><br>Would actually consider it then cause the iPadOS is absolute garbage as an actual DesktopOS replacement when connected to one of these. Though MacOS is quite limited, it&#39;s the third-party apps I use that sucks.\\xa0<br><br>*Online shopping apps besides Amazon STILL don&#39;t rotate to Landscape mode<br>* Facebook Messenger is buggy<br>* TradingView glitches on the orientation<br>* Some websites I use oddly doesn&#39;t quite &quot;fit&quot; despite being a 12.9&quot; display<br>* The iOS style file manager just doesn&#39;t feel as flexible as the Finder on MacOS.<br>* Canva on iPadOS feels second class vs Canva on web<br>* YTStudio App is still limited vs YTStudio on web<br><br>The iPad is great. iPadOS is okay but everything else still  feels like a second-class citizen on the iPad. And im watching this with a 4th gen pro :/ For some reason, your videos dim and brighten every few seconds. I don’t know if it’s a video glitch or what? But it ONLY happens on YOUR videos for some reason. Still running iPad os right? Then I&#39;ll be sticking to keeping my m1 ipad pro, and I&#39;ll be keeping it where it has been. In my bag uncharged for months. Can someone tell me what game he was playing please 😂😭 They have to make up for that headset loss so everything got more expensive <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> pause ⏸ Hey umm... sorry for disturbing but you crossed Apple in subscribers so when are you realeasing the phone? He didn&#39;t yet, so close though! That nano screen definitely eats up brightness and the deep blacks though. I feel like they made it so thin because they want to emulate a laptop screen as much as possible. One of the main issues with using the Magic Keyboard is how top heavy it is when in on a lap.. perhaps this design feature was kept in mind? what is the last song used? Wus using a tablet I got a iPad Pro ad watching this video😂😂😂😂 But Sir, remarkable is is designed to give your concentration back… <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=492\">8:12</a> the macbook pro should be 1KG... the ipad pro + keyboard proves its possible.

Theres no bragging rights for blowing money on a expensive toy. If you own a iPad from 2019 or ANY M iPad model you are not missing anything bc theyve added nothing to begin with. Who goes and buys a 1000HP Ferrari engine that comes packaged in a Prius, thats the iPad Pro. But does it install dmg? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=342\">5:42</a> he looks so embarrassed to have to say that looks like they&#39;re trying to compete with the surface pro Isnt there a limit to how thin something should be? Can it be bent unintentionally easily? 😅😅 I can buy a car for that price  in Trinidad can we do hardcore coding on the iPad like python etc Shut up and take my money … BOMBOCLAT I’ve bough an iPad pro in 2019 and I haven’t had the need for a laptop since. I can do everything I need on it just easier and faster than on a laptop. I understand is not for everyone but for 90% of population who doesn’t use it with an specific purpose is going to have a better screen, better battery, better speakers, better performance and is going to last longer than an average laptop. All they need to do is upgrade the software more capable in tablets and they&#39;ll replace laptops very promptly. Boss create a your MOBILE COLLECTION TOUR plz 🙏❤<br>And WATCHES etc ... But the whole point of remarkable it to use it while being disconnected from unnecessary apps and notifications. I think replacing it with the iPad would hinder your productivity apple people buy all anyway An iPad is a great machine, but it will never replace a Mac because of iPadOS. We had the same story since the M1 iPad. The second i saw the metal keyboard from apple directly I realized they&#39;re definitely killing the macbook air in the next 5yr-decade. People in the comments be like people are buying iPad Pro in 2024 to watch movies without knowing millions of pro users use iPad for their work flow. To be honest, I made the switch in 2022. The Apple Pencil “pro” has a very little amount of change from the old one, and same with keyboard. I think you COULDVE done the change 3+ years ago and it will feel almost the same as now. Why only 1 camera now? Thats why its lighter😅 I have spend years with all the ipad sizes.. best one is the mini. I hope it gets a pro version. <br><br>- The 12.9 stay at home <br>- Ipad mini LTE on the go <br>- iphone mini go well with the mini lte Daaaamn No way I would ever spend that much on a glorified tablet when I could get a fully kitted out gaming laptop that does even more for under half the price.  Also, can you imagine breaking the ipad and how much it would cost for repair, ouch! Tip for PC users: If you have the money: Get a desktop PC and remote connect to it through AV1 decoding That&#39;s looks like a heavy influence from Samsung tab s9 ultra and dex mode 😅 You could have bought a good second hand car for that money The m1 keyboard has many glitches as a user myself so this is probably a big mac like improvement I’ve been using the 2018 for a long time, it’s still pretty fast. I’m about to buy the new one too with the Max configuration. I wouldn’t spend that kind of money just to play games on it but if you are into drawing/animation/painting it’s been the best product on the market for a long time. I have a $1400 windows laptop that runs every game maxed except fallout 76 (almost maxed, screw you Todd), apple can hop off a cliff Despite my best efforts, I couldn&#39;t replace my laptop with an iPad due to iOS limitations when compared to macOS. In simpler terms, iPads are like vitamins, while laptops are like painkillers. However, IPad cannot replace laptop until MacOS is available on it. I think Jerry could just rip this one in half, let alone bend it lol! I&#39;m waiting for @jerryrigeverything Wow this video it looks more like a paid\\xa0advertising ...without the P explicitly marked<br>Actually the (only) advantage of an e-ink tablet is exactly not doing what a iPad can...it won&#39;/can&#39;t compete with an iPad <br>I&#39;ve tried to get rid of laptop....had iPad Pro with magic keyboard (which is far of being easy to use where you&#39;re not sitting at a table) and Pencil for some years. While it&#39;s very good for taking notes via GoodNotes, for media consuming for some photo/video editing whatsoever...what I&#39;ve found is that as soon as you are in need of doing some serious project with multiple files opened and 2 screens, iPad OS will haunt you...Yes it does some sort of multitasking but you must be able to enjoy punishing yourself doing that and your productivity will hardly match the one using a laptop. Also having all at your disposal can be incredibly distracting some times...when you just want to be focused at something (like receiving an email during a meeting)...<br>In the end I gave the iPad to my wife, bought a MacBook for all the work and for my notes I bought a Scribe (not Remarkable cause is imho too expensive for what it offers supplementary compared with Scribe).\\xa0<br><br>Maybe, just maybe if there will be ever a MacOS like for iPad someday, I&#39;ll come back to it... Useless with iPadOS If you remove back cover and put heatsink with fan and use it as a desktop then it will be a true M4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=78\">1:18</a> you will instantly understand why an iPad is better if you play rhythm games like Arcaea, Lanota or Phigros, phone too small, touchscreen laptops are just inherently bad for it. finallyyyy someone said something about mobile rithm games slap the iPad Pro with Tandem OLED screen to a Macbook = the next Macbook series. The next Macbook series is already here. They&#39;re just selling the screens first! If someone buys this  💩 then definitely there is something wrong in this world This is basically a 16 minute video of a guy publicly justifying to himself his expensive purchase 😂 Apple really sold their first protoype of the foldable ipad this year huh Waiting for the apple Cloth Pro to be announced next year. 980 Dollars only for £3000 I expect it to have no bezels, those are chunky monsters I have tablets and Laptop for windows and Apple and i see that i love to work on windows because it gives me laptop experience in my surface pro 9 tablet.<br><br>I wish apple also can implement Mac os for ipad or Ipad os should be similar like Mac Os A 16-minute-long video about why Surface tablets has been a good idea all along. I don&#39;t have money to buy the techs smartphones and laptops but i really like what you do...for me you&#39;re my teacher @Mrwhosetheboss much love and respect...am DJ Black CatUG from Uganda The major subtle downside: 4K in Netflix and HBO is not supported. &quot;Just&quot; HDR. This ad brought to you by Apple. Why is nobody talking about this audio zoom thing? I would like to have your macbook I have a m1 and magic case im thinking what everyone is thinking 😂😂😂 Drop test on a 3600$ tablet soon ? 🤣😜 PS ... Remember you have no file manager on iPad, so you depend on other device to backup (forget cloud) The new ipad pro, the most powerful youtube and netflix device &quot;I don&#39;t like tablets because they&#39;re phone / laptop hybrids... But thjs one is better because it&#39;s a tablet thsg costs as much as a laptop.. But it&#39;s thiiiiim&quot;.<br><br>Shill. As always. Stick an M4 in an iPhone and I might switch to Apple if they get the AI part right because privacy will become ever more essential. Add a good microphone and gesture to the watch so it&#39;s the equivalent of saying hey Siri, Dick Tracey style and you have a hardware setup that&#39;s ready for the AI assisted future. Woop apple just discovered the surface... 350 for the keyboard attachment? That thing definitely costs £20 max to make You could spend the same amount of money on an incredible PC with an excellent processor and graphics card instead of wasting them on an overpriced toy. Can you please just put you freaking outro back.dude😖 Hands-On ? Seriously dude , you are making clickbait Captions and Thumbnails ? We don&#39;t expect this from you @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> 😮 @mrwhosetheboss - what do you do with the tech that you don&#39;t use as your daily drivers? I have iPad air 64 GB m2 and on this iPad, I had some annotated PDFs which  got corrupted by itself on this iPad. I have not seen this problem with any other device and when I talked to iCare, they told me please do not annotate PDFs because they do not have a solution for this, and apparently few other users also have the same problem.  Worst decision of buying iPad Air. I do not recommend. I&#39;ll be waiting for your feedback on that. If you change your MacBook for an Ipad I would love to know the results of it. For me the main downside of a tablet is that it can not do what a full laptop does (at leats not as easy). If I had this money I would buy a really good gaming pc Apple fans can sell one kidney  and one  eye Love the vids If the screen was good, we wouldn&#39;t see reflections of everything in it while it was on full brightness What a bunch of copycats! Sponsored by apple💀 Sounds interesting, but as a long-time Mac (1992), iPad, and Remarkable user, good luck with the iPad battery life compared with Remarkable. The former always seems to be short on battery when needed, whereas the latter keeps going for a lot longer..... You have more money that sense? Man, the folks setting prices at Apple lately must just be twitching in a pile of cocaine and empty Red Bull cans.  I couldn’t justify buying this at twice my income. Watch it fold like paper when Jerryrigeverything does a durability test iPad does not require laptop space for working. Of course you can try to use it as PC alternative option but you will have struggles. For me I get rid of my Macbook Air because I didn&#39;t use it as much as I thought. I bought it because instead I would have to buy iPad + keyboard so it was obvious choice for me to go with Macbook Air. I later realised that I didn&#39;t need the keyboard for just scrolling and streaming. It&#39;s far easier for me to travel with just an iPad especially that you do not have to use dedicated charger and in Macbook you kinda have to. It&#39;s also easier to grab iPad and do something on it than grabbing Macbook Air, even as thin as it is :). I ended up waiting for this release and ordered base iPad Pro 256 GB and I think this will suit all of my needs. I believe OLED is worth this price - we will see how about the burning in the end, after few months/years but I do not care. I used Tab S amoled and didn&#39;t see any burning. I still have it but it&#39;s barely usable because of the garbage software. I wish I can afford it and the amount of cost in Australia $5000 for it $3.999 for 2TB Still thicker then a tab s9 ultra and a worse display Very good. But why not an Ipad mini Pro? Try using an app designed for iPhone on the iPad and tell me it’s “designed” for iPad.<br><br>90% of devs just tick a button to allow the app on iPad and just stretch the UI.

I don&#39;t trust anyone who has never seen a need for an iPad. Also someone who uses an Android phone and Android tablets? 🤣 there is no way apple will make ipad as good as mac Now lets see what Surface pro does with the x elite chip and galaxy tab s10... ball is now in MS and samsung hands Hot take, i miss web services over apps.

So a Microsoft Surface? Yo @Mrwhosetheboss wait until you discover ipad hubs too (:  Also if you are not playing games and using your pc/laptop for mostly browsing and office stuff ipad with keyboard pencil combo is the one of the best. But... if you are not in the apple eco system and if you already have a xiaomi or samsung tablet with keyboard/pencil combo again why should you spend over 3000$ ? But not gonna lie i am using M1 chip ipad pro and even M1 is over kill for ipad and now they put M4. Super light which is very good but that tiny thickness may be a problem. It looks too fragile.

My thoughts are that since all the iPads have security vulnerabilities, where basically every iPad can be jailbroken, apple thought lets upgrade the whole thing since they hate jailbreaking. <br>I think tablets are just laptops for kids.

I absolutely love your humor and love your channel ❤ If you couldn’t replace your Mac with the last version, this doesn’t change anything. Until they change the OS, these hardware upgrades are somewhat pointless. Apple, just release dual OS option (Mac OS when attached to keyboard, iPad OS when not). Make the iPad capable of running MacOS. Then it would sell like hot cakes, but fortunately kill the Mac at the same time. With the USB port, you can just use an external drive. <br><br>I replaced my MacBook Pro 2014 with the iPad Pro M2 and I only have great things to say about it. So its pretty much a notebook with less ports. Booooringggg i cant wait to see the Jerry Rig Everything video of the IPad being broken in half, i feel like apple is again in the time they tried to make everything as thin as they can and like on the iphone 6, thats gonna be a problem. because in something like a backpack theres even more tension than in a pocket of your pants, i definitely wouldnt buy it because i think its just gonna bend if not even broken in half at some point So it&#39;s a bit better and way more expensive Microsoft Surface for mac users. kinda overpriced and old keyboards and even 2nd gen apple pencils cant use.

So apple is loosing people interest in laptops that they now have to reimagine or rewire people into new ways and reasons to buy ipad. The apple pencil is now doing what surface pen is doing from past 11 years... The iPad which is touch device doesn&#39;t work good with the final cut pro 2 without keyboard..lol &quot;Mobile games are better designed&quot;, that&#39;s the point when I stopped listening :D how about using a convertible laptop? Even though they look great, I just don&#39;t see how it can replace my laptop. I really dislike apps, prefer the website for most stuff, and hate touchscreen keyboards.. that specialized coating sounds good though, could use that on my macbook I have the M1 iPad Pro 12.9 and honestly this iPad is NOTHING new. I have the Logitech Smart Folio, and that is practically the same as the new Smart Keyboard. The biggest limitation of the iPad is the software, and it’s still the same so, no, it won’t replace your MacBook, you are just being brainwashed. Yeah, if you have a new enough iPad there is absolutely no point in upgrading... Especially if you have a keyboard for it, because the new ones don&#39;t fit in classic apple fashion. &quot;I always feel better when a  product tells me to use their app than when they direct me to a website&quot; Never Cook Again Thin means breaks easily... it&#39;ll snap if you breathe on it wrong mark my words! They actually said its just as strong. <br>Jerryrigeverything will probably show us But why are the bezels still so thick? The iPad would be a perfect MacBook replacement, except for software compatibility. So many apps exclusive to MacOS are the reason people buy them. I love your videos . I watch a lot of tech youtubers but i like the way you give honest and true info about a product .Watching your videos makes me feeel like I am in a lecture class and i love that actually😊😊 I think it would be disappointing. Apple&#39;s iPads are in such position right now where they can be superior to MB or at least the lower end when it comes to performance. Combine that with all the accessories, faaar superior display, touch screen and all of the superior mobile ecosystem that you mentioned and penvil support, it suddenly makes the MBs obsolete. But Apple won&#39;t do that imo. Now really. <br><br>Its the OS that makes the difference. Its not the same as macbook @@Aneliuse I never said it was the same Too much money!!! Give it 2 years you can get it for 500 dollars What is the normal wrighter thing you were using Everytime I see Tim Crook it makes me laugh. I keep thinking of a &quot;human wishbone&quot; I mean just how bowlegged can one be ??? LMAO LMAO. Don&#39;t spend this stupid amount of money and do what I did. Went out and got a 2nd Gen Ipad Pro for SUPER CHEAP which literally does everything I need it to for about one eighth the price of the new one Intel core i9 Apple knows they need to step it up because windows on snapdragon X/X plus/X elite is on its way. this will be a big deal because yes snapdragon X soc will start on windows but it won&#39;t be 6 months before Android and Linux runs on them too. Thats why they just crushed the competition again Bro i goy an ipad pro ad while watching this I wouldn’t bother with the nano screen it scatters more light If they bring macOS to I pad and introduce some Autodesk apps I will switch. But apple doesn&#39;t want to. For the average user it Still have not that much use over the m1 ipad realy Look I am a med student and I feel that the iPad is hands down the best device because I can use it for note taking , pdf annotations , social media , gaming and consuming content ( not as a camera you weirdos😂). So I place the iPad on top of my apple products scale that&#39;s my whole year worth of school fee💀💀 Samsung already did all that years ago... It is definitely a mistake! Soon you’ll know 😪 iPads are so much more casual to use than a MacBook. The features of this apple pencil is similar to my old 2013 Samsung note 3 pencil😀 Lol this man&#39;s going to be extremely disappointed if he expects a smart home just from Apple products. Most of these reviews are biased. You don&#39;t really need this tab.. Just use your older tab or get an old M1 or M2 Tab or Samsung&#39;s Tab 🤟🏻😌 Where to buy that grey Pullover?

Apple has stated this many times themselves. I have a MacBook and an IPad Pro (with cellular)- I am a professional video editor. It is EXTREMELY rare that I use my Mac. BTW it only costs an extra $10 a month to add the iPad as a cellular device, and it was beyond worth it. It has become a central hub, while I’m working. My iMessages, mail, and FaceTime all come to this as well. It also allows me to pick up and work anywhere. I love my 2022 edition, keyboard and pencil- and I am SO EXCITED to get these new ones. Very rarely do I spend money on items for work and myself 😂 For a 1tb iPad Pro you pay $4500 AUD… more than a 4090…😂😂😂 Spend thousands on a tablet, give it a keyboard. May as well just get a macbook Still cant use statistic program for university whereas the mac has it... for free even Samsung fan here 🙋\\u200d♂️<br>Apple really did cook with this one, the only downside is the price but that&#39;s just apple being apple Well the m2 iPad also has center stage and it’s pretty dope for ft The thinner the iPads are the more uncomfortable to hold them. I love my older 9.7 Pro iPad with its curved edges - use it as a book reader. Using newer iPad pro is pain for longer time. Can you make phone calls with that? HELL NAW AM NOT BUYING APPLES NEW TABLET THAT ALMOST WORTH LIKE A APPLE VISION  FOR KIDS<br><br>(samsung has better quality price stuff) Finally, an optimal way to watch cocomelon I can’t seem to find info on the normal new iPad.

Will be waiting for ur performance test on the aaa games on ipad like resident evil and death stranding to actually see where M4&#39;s GPU stands As a developer this would never replace my pc but you can now see more faces in a zoom/teams/whatever meeting... I swear everyone who insists that they need the m4 is either really well off and has the money to burn, or could have done with an m1 air that costs less than half as much Yes, it is a good aid but can not replace a laptop or PC. Yes. Simply YES Why??... CODM 😂😂 BRO WAS DEEP THROATING THAT TOOTH BRUSH WHAT THE The only problem I have with ipads are that they still run on ipados and not macos.. making it incompatible with a lot of important apps. Arun don&#39;t worry I still think every single pun of yours is funny When the magic keyboard first came out for the iPad Pro I immediately bought one.  It was <b>the absolute best</b> keyboard I had ever typed on, and that is having used macs for years and years at this point.  It is absolutely the selling point of any iPad Pro and 1000% worth every penny it costs.  But for me, unfortunately, I absolutely need the tools MacOS provides.  It is the one limitation that has kept me from upgrading my 2018 11&quot; iPad Pro.  Yes it is very nice to type on. iPadOS has improved every year.  But... its just not there.  They need the mac features for someone like me.  Adding the function row on the new Magic Keyboard gives me *hope*. Who would spend $5600 on a Ipad Apple subscribers: 18.9M hmm...<br>MrWTB subscribers: 18.5M hmm...<br>MKBHD subscribers: 18.8M hmm....<br><br>Who&#39;s gonna win? My 2020 iPad Pro is my most used device. The boss is Apple. That is who the boss is The problem with tablets is if you want a very good Android tablet or iPad it is  going to cost a lot of money .<br>I can remember getting a tablet for 230 Bucks it was c.r.a.p inferior to my ZenFone 4 in performance it only had 1GB of ram and a weak CPU Why new products don’t provide new things. Yearly releasing new stuff is stupid. Keep old things doing for same. Arun your light guy did a bad job at setting up the lights as the video went by, he could have adjusted as the light was dimming outside or maybe you guys wanted to be symmetry with the outer light in the environment to that of the room&#39;s set up. Arun dont buy the matt display (marque&#39;s opinion) I thought this same thing yesterday. Can i Code an compile an Android Apo on an Ipad? Should i buy macbook m3 pro or ipad pro m4... I have a computer, i have a laptop, i have a tablet, i have a phone..... non of these can be replaced by the other. Ask again in 15 to 20 years. Imagine dropping a $3600 ipad on the floor 💀 whatever it is, please change that retcehed wallpaper used in the ipad shown in the video It&#39;s pure stupidity to pay more than 500 for a phone or tablet because they got much better value for money We all gonna wait for the bend test from zack anyway lol And you can&#39;t even code on this, why apple? I think I&#39;d prefer an Android foldable, but I really love the new keyboard. arun has gone off the rails saying the iPad in its current form could be a Macbook replacement. it’s literally a nerfed Macbook If he thinks this can be a MacBook he should try running an IT business from just a iPad… GLHF with that… Apple just makes up an excuse for stupidity rich to spend money on, and “bought” it - most influential people get it as a freebie or have amounts of cash laying around it doesn’t matter how much it costs. I can afford buying one but for this amount of money I rather buy a MacBook Pro then an iPad in it’s current OS state. It’s in no way comparable to macOS at its current design state and Apple never will do that because otherwise MacBooks would get an touch screen upgrade… they want customers to get both- that’s why iPad OS doesn’t support multi profile users. If you got 4 kids you better get 4 iPad littles and 2 airs or better… but for the birds and bees we won’t add stickers to the new iPads… Apple only cares about more money - not their customers. He makes some really good points tho, I.e. most online services now have apps as their main portal. I am definitely on the same boat where I prefer all my banking, e-commerce, internet and phone payment gateways etc are all done on an app as opposed to a website portal. Some e-commerce companies give better incentives/discounts on their mobile apps than on their website. I’m just waiting that those apps to run on macOS as well, since all modern Macs are now running on ARM M-series chips. Then we’re back to square one.<br><br>It’s definitely not a true 1:1 replacement yet but for Arun’s use cases, he seemed to be convinced that it’s possible for him. His use cases and ours aren’t the same. But it’s probably true, the future is definitely app-based and the iPad does that better than any Macs. Guy is just lying to his audience It depends on your use case man.<br>If for him it is a MacBook replacement than that means whatever he was doing on the macbook, he can do on the iPad with little to no drawback. It isn&#39;t necessary a MacBook replacement for everyone, neither is he implying that. I feel like he dropped the ball on this one. Sadly absolutely nothing had changed in terms of the software with this new iPad lineup. Metal finish magic keyboard still loses to Macbook because the angle is still limited. Even the M1 iPad can do so much but Is neutered at the software level and has been for a lot of years now, I don&#39;t see that changing either. @@michaelcamello527 nah he did say “for my use”. If it can be a MacBook replacement for his use then that’s good for him. For me it’s almost a laptop replacement, the only thing I miss on my iPad that I still use my laptop for is blender, and league of legends. For anything else I can choose between my iPad or laptop and there would be practically no difference. The one and only thing holding the iPad back is… iPadOS 💀 Also some of the &quot;new features&quot; of the new ipad pro have been available on the older ones for a fraction of the price. Like the barrelroll of the pencil. Or the squeezing when you could just double tab on the old one. Additionally most of the new processing power of the m4 chip cant be accessed due to heat and software issues @@Connor_Conntroller m4 is good because it has more performance per watt. Thus less heat and faster performance before and after thermal throttle @@nicowasheremate This is the one thing holding back the iPad. The tech alone is good enough, but the software is what kills is. Heck, I would&#39;ve replaced my Macbook a long time ago for engineering university if I could take my Calculus notes and program Software Engineering projects, and manage the stuff like on my Macbook with the iPad. It&#39;s the perfect 2-in-1 in terms of hardware. But on software? It sucks. @@oh-noe it does, But If you faktor in the Space lost for heat transfer you simply cannot unlock this Performance.

Second with a thinner body, comes smaller battery and more thermal throttling. Third, anyone gonna mention the aspect ratio on this thing? Last but not least, I truly believe tablets one day will replace laptops but they will need a couple more ports and much better software integration.

I just watched cause i enjoy your videos hahaha ❤❤❤ Most of the good things for the new iPads come from being better than the MacBooks. So, against laptops without OLED, without touchscreen, still in clamshell form, and without a proper packet manager, ... Market segmentation and keeping features from consumers is making Apple billions. bro why is your camera quality getting worse and dark? 🔥 Mrwhosetheboss, I think a lot of Apple clients feel exactly like you feel over the new Ipad Pro.  You &quot;want&quot; it.  Now, I too &quot;want it&quot;....but I don&#39;t need it.  Your video had a lot of &quot;I want it&quot; but if you step back and ask yourself &quot;Do you need it?&quot;  Nope, you don&#39;t.  So, save the money ... for now.  Wait for the M5.  🙂 the most basic ipad pro is more expensive than my pc. So we&#39;re just gonna ignore how he was using that tooth brush 💀💀 he makes me regret buying my mac m2 air You bought it because it&#39;s cents to you. Stop it Laughs in fold (phone + tablet) It still uses iPad os, if only it used Mac OS instead. No matter how powerful it is , it is limited by its os Sounds like an infomercial to me. Just get a laptop with touchscreen If you didnt notice, Huawei launch Matepad Pro 13.2 half year ago which has capability to replace laptop. Of course performance wise no as good as apple but they did it first.

One on each side would be nice. I found your channel recently. I have to tell you that yours has quickly become my favorite channel. Keep up the good work. I feel like apple want you to have a iPhone a ipad and a MacBook because switching to a tablet at least with Apple feels purposely hamstrung because they want you to buy a MacBook as well <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=944\">15:44</a> 1000£ extra for 1,744 extra Tb 😂😂😂 Apple must be smoking something when 2Tb top tier gen4 SSD are like 150£ Unfortunately since they run iPadOS, what is the point? They don&#39;t do anything that the iPad Pros of 7 years ago didn&#39;t do. At least not right now (they are gaining AI features in iPadOS 18 if feature parity between iPadOS and iOS continues. If rumours are true the A series iPads won&#39;t get iPadOS 18). The Pencil gained new features, but that&#39;s the pencil gaining features. The keyboard gained new stuff, but that&#39;s the keyboard that gains the new features. Plus if you&#39;re adding a keyboard, you now just have a severely limited laptop When you&#39;re an Apple simp, it&#39;s not that hard to figure out. I still don&#39;t see this replacing my surface go. Windows is simply so much more versatile, nevermind having a micro sd slot for storage extension and not beeing locked into the Apple ecosystem. Hey Arun. I just have one thing to say, after seeing this review of yours. &quot;People should stop watching Apple product reviews online totally&quot;. You being a tech reviewer, who has the access to basically all the new tech, pricey or not, should have the moral duty to clearly say &quot;bad is bad&quot;, specially given your videos are made for the people, and not for the companies like Apple.\\r<br>There have been other youtubers whom I unsubscribed, just because they couldn&#39;t say one negative thing about Apple, just so that Apple invites them to their launch event and they can have these early access videos.\\r<br>Like right now, you don&#39;t know the exact M4 specs (said the exact same stuff as their launch video which weirdly compares it to M2 and even M1, &quot;not to M3&quot;), yet you seem to be totally fine with it. Why aren&#39;t you even talking about things like, thinner body means smaller battery (they had the chance to double the battery life with this ipad), and costly new pro pencil.\\r<br>These &quot;consumer harming&quot; tactics then seeps to other brands and they too start the trend like the removal of charger, super pricy accessories and the &quot;this-works-better-with-our-other-device&quot; tradeoff.\\r<br>Why cant you be like &quot;THIS IS WRONG&quot;. Why do you always want to put Apple reviews in a very optimistic way, no matter how crazy they are with the decisions about such new tech? Please do not loose yourself on moral grounds as being a content creator, try to be humanly helpful to the people, the very people whose views are youtubers bread and butter. Otherwise, there is no difference between such review videos and Apple removing chargers from phones calling it &quot;environmental friendly&quot;. fr like it&#39;s a great product but it&#39;s worth 600 dollars at most, not half of 6000 I think this is because he only used it in the apple event, where he can&#39;t test properly, or this is a embargo date and the only topics he is allowed to mention are ones Apple has chosen, so most likely are positive. He said he will do a full review later, and that might be more critical. @@The_JediPenguin you can check his previous Apple product reviews. They all be like, Arun finds a way to somehow call it so game changing and always optimistic about even the cons of it.<br>And btw, check MKBHD video on the same, he literally called it pointless to have such an iPad, no buttering of words or optimistic approach to not hurt Apple @@PFnove yes brother. See how Arun &quot;cleverly&quot; pointed out how this new ipad is an alternate to his Macbook + remarkable tablet in many scenarios. But he forgets, what he has bought remarkable for, only remarkable can do that (And the ipads at the time when he bought remarkable would offer the same functionality as the current ipads, from his usage perspective.) Nobody mentioned, but that&#39;s next level. No, since we already are next level, this is next next level.<br><br><br>😁<br><br>@mrwhosetheboss, thank you for your thoughtful review. You catch my interest although I&#39;m not interested at all into a $3000+ losable device Soon they will make a new division of there business... Apple inc and Apple inc pro I always think that Apple products are too expensive and give you two little features for the price, but this new iPad might be the first Apple device to change that If you get an iPhone you can hotspot without turning hotspot on for easy Wi-Fi access So the iPad is worth it if you want to replace your notebook for 3600$.<br>Got it. You bought it because you got money for saying this. He didn&#39;t mention that the keyboard is sold separately... At that point another $100 around price. I would rather buy a MacBook than that. I mean I get having a iPad with this much capable but as a pc guy I feel it’s locked down setup is not that great. Even though it has a desktop chip it can’t run desktop apps. I understand the appeal but not for me. Great vid I&#39;d already choose to just go to a website then have to install a new app. Horrible thing that&#39;s become the norm In as much as this is an impressive device, I don&#39;t think this will replace laptops. Most of the use cases you mentioned are majorly issues that the iPad solves for just, not the majority of people. Also, the device is pretty expensive. I do wonder sometimes exactly what planet Apple are on. Who is the target market for a 4 grand tablet? Who&#39;s buying this? And why do you hate your money? sure replace your laptop with a giant screen that has even more limited software than the laptop. Crazy waste of money. <br><br>Like for real what apps are you going to use outside of the apple apps preinstalled I’m curious to what the battery is going to be like. With a dual OLED screen, powerful laptop grade chip with dedicated hardware just to run the display and in a thinner chassis..I also noticed they never mentioned it once in the keynote. &quot;You can now squeeze the pencil to bring up the menu&quot;...Samsung is laughing Nothing has changed in the iPad v last iPad. You sound like a kid, impressionable by fluf marketing language. Folks, go watch MKBHD, it&#39;s merely spec bump (and actually worse cameras). I also don&#39;t see how Arun is really using s24 ultra as he gets full on aroused with every apple PR event. Never thought he&#39;d become the #1 apple fanboy. Somehow this video gave me an unreal MKBHD-Vibe lol Good luck with that. Tried it with an M1 iPad and it was a big fail. I don&#39;t see anything different here. I bit thinner and a slightly better screen. What it really needs is MacOS (and a lot more RAM). As an M1 ipad user, I can say that the biggest downside is the OS. Where are my adobe aps apple? Stage manager isn’t really my thing also, I would like to be exactly like macOS. I want the IPAD TO RUN MACOS. Not this ipadOS thing. It is really close for me to switch from my bulky windows laptop, but the OS is absolute garbage. Great tablet evolution, apple made this one great Can this iPad support multiple users…. No Please may I have an M3 MacBook Air? Didn&#39;t you buy it to make a video about it? 😉 $3600 is absolutely ludicrous. I know people are still going to buy it though. Only 400k more people This is what happens when you have so much money, you don&#39;t know what to do with it. If you’re getting rid of your MacBook I’ll happily take it haha &quot;The World&#39;s Biggest Hypocrite&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂 Where is the benefit of changing the devices thiskness in the range of fractions of a millimeter? in the end it doesn´t matter if it´s 6,2 or 5,3 mm thin. But you´d need a new case, because the old one just doesn´t fit perfectly anymore. EARLY ZZZ COPY ON THE IPAD I SAW IT <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=349\">5:49</a> . the game is suposted to have a worldwide release in july and yet there it is on the ipad That is going to be 2,877.00GBP disappointment I am afraid. aaaaaah no thanx The bendgate flashback is crazy. older ipads had most of the capabilities that you were highlighting pls reveal pixel 8a &quot;That&#39;s an obscene amount to pay for a table,...BUT...&quot; It says a lot about what Apple thinks about it&#39;s customers when they are confident that they are gullible enough to pay for a tablet what they would pay for a motorbike or used car. Plus the keyboard and pencil to actually make it useful NINJA KAMUI MASK DESIGN Louis Rossman watching this is thinking of the repair nightmare this probably is. All the inconveniences under the hood The display is made by SAMSUNG😂 Zero interest. I got an ipad pro once. Still the 4:3 screen ratio which leaves you while watching movies with tremendeous big letterboxes and a remaining movie screen at the size of the iphone pro max. If I want a great content tab I use my Samsung tab s9 ultra which has also a oled screen and a great 16.10 ratio. For work I use a Mac anyway. DONT DO IT imagine just seeing a video with a full view from evening t sunset just tell me why would i need ipad/tablet if i already have a smartphone and a laptop. <br><br>actually  i have macbook pro, and 2 android phones (yes, i m a weird 2 phone guy).. also i got one tablet xiomi pad 4. but I do not use to much other than media consumption and smart home device controls. Nice Apple commercial Arun is slowly but surely becoming a full on apple guy. From the iPhone to never being a watch guy to now using an Apple watch to now an iPad lol. I love how when ppl say this when they see someone using an Apple product for a brief time while 99% of the content is just the opposite. He uses the S24U more tho but I get what you mean ecosystem lock in it is.... Apple makes each product, the best to fit in their specific ecosystem<br>once you start, it will just feel better To buy another apple product to get that integration... That’s how Apple converted me. One product at a time.😅 Because they make good products I mean he literally uses a Samsung Ultra he&#39;s only buying them &#39;cause he has some money. Apple is a status like a Dior handbag @@filip9564 &quot;which only work better with their own products&quot;<br>&quot;Or else it would be very inconvenient to have both ecosystems and since apple works better with apple&quot;... He uses the S24 Ultra what are you talking about? @Mrwhosetheboss.. so you started the video in the morning and ended in the night... 😝 Exactly. I also bought a top end Tablet in 2020. All I ended up with watching Netflix and YouTube in my bed and during travelling. I didnt even use it for writing email. Cool 😮 Why do you spit when saying three? (Thuurreee) not worth it until u can run macos app directly on it You could buy the best pc money can buy and it wouldn&#39;t come close that price 🤦 Forget the apps. What you are trying to say is that Macs dont have touch screens. As an Apple fanboy, I hope this current apple led by tim cook just fails.<br>Gone are the days of the ambitious Steve Jobs Real Steve Jobs would be ashamed of Apple today depute the company being so big these days @@NoshikiYT yeah it looks like tim cook is an excellent profit maximizer but shit innovator, sadly thats probably the first video that Arun is lighten by physical light which as the video progress it gets darker and darker and you can understand how much time it takes only to film it Apple should just take all the tech from the iPad Pro M4 and slap it into a redesign super thin and light 13&quot; and 15&quot; MacBook Air &quot;ultra light&quot; line. With oled displays too. Think old MacBook 12 thinness, but in a package that actually performs and has a few more ports. The new iPad Pro M4 show it can no be done in a thin fan less envelope, so why not a real &quot;air&quot; laptop as well? Let&#39;s be honest. This device only makes sense for artists (Digital illustrators, photographers, videographers, ..etc.) and rich college students. Im waiting for you to be disappointed:) Windows have Netflix app with download option. I was surprised finding out Mac don’t have one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=456\">7:36</a><br>I don&#39;t think Apple will allow the iPad to have 100% software functionality and support of the Mac, regardless of how powerful the M4 chip in the iPad is. This is because they will likely want you to buy both the iPad and the Mac, and offering full compatibility might cannibalize Mac sales. There is already iMac which is basically a big iPad with a keyboard. If there&#39;s a &quot;guess&quot; of greedy option, then Apple will do it 100% \\u200b@@proudbacteria1373 Its weaker and not portable, totally different market Much like why Macbooks are not getting touchscreens. It’s a shame because that didn’t used to be Apples mentality. When they launched the iPhone, they knew it would cannibalize the iPods but did it because they knew it was innovation and would suit them better in the long run. <br><br>Why can’t Apple make a Mac/iPad combo? Basically make the Mac Screen an iPad, then have the keyboard attach at the bottom with all the extra chips for added power? When you attach the tablet part, it becomes “MacMode” then when you detach, it goes to “iPad Mode”<br><br>Honestly that would be an incredible device if they could pull it off and Apple should be able too with all their in house chips. Don&#39;t NEVER buy a shitty Apple product! 😢😮 Exactly @@drewmorrison  I want to live in the timeline where Jobs is at the pinnacle of health and still alive today leading Apple. because they wwant more moneeeyyyy @@didiervandendaele4036hilarious double negatives are hilarious @@proudbacteria1373no its not You think this, but in truth Apple would love to hold the market in each area all on one device. Imagine an iPad that turns into a Mac computer and can also be used as an Apple TV They have been doing this for ages now. But if you are a wise buyer you know even the previous ipads are already capable enough to handle anything on the app store. Just think about your lifestyle if you really need those overpriced tech. Or you will just end up not using them most of the time. @@ILoveGrilledCheese let&#39;s wait and see @ILoveGrilledCheese\\xa0 I don&#39;t think apple want their ecosystem to revolve around the Ipad. @@paisleepunk of course it was not never my goal 😉 This is exactly my take on this whole situation. What Apple wants from the ipad pro is people like Arun saying &quot;i need this&quot; and for bonus points &quot;it will replace all of these other non-apple products&quot;. What Apple doesnt want from the ipad pro is people like Arun saying &quot;now i dont need this other very expensive apple product I own&quot;. Depending on how many people say the latter, I predict the next iteration will be nerfed even further. @Ravp90\\xa0 hence, they&#39;ll make sure you have a reason to buy the ipad and the mac. My suspicion is that the App Store revenue is so great that Apple will eventually ban all third party software from being installed on Macs. what do you think the iPhone did to the iPod touch? the iPod made apple one of the wealthiest companies on the planet and they OWNED the portable digital music industry @@robertobokarev439explain the ipod @@drewmorrison Oh trust me they probably can and have tested it. They just won&#39;t. This is not absolutely correct but also not wrong. This is happening because of Android and MS and not Apple. Apple is ahead of competition mainly due to Android offering fast depreciation (not enough support). On the other hand surface is a weak machine with bad battery. When competition wakes up Apple will offer unification. Until then apple offers best value even by buying two devices (iPad, MacBook) Totally disagree. The iPad and Mac are fundamentally very different. The iPad is designed from the ground up as a touch screen device, and the Mac is not. If the iPad functioned exactly like a Mac, that would be called a laptop. You can go buy one right now if you want. @mikemccormick6128\\xa0 Totally disagree with me or with Arun? Because I&#39;m not in support of what he said either. Listen to what he said, Watch from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=456\">7:36</a>. By the way, the ipad and the Mac have the same cpu, so they might as well have the same software compatibility. Form factor or product design is irrelevant and shouldn&#39;t be what determines what an ipad and a Mac should do. You can&#39;t put an M4 chip in an ipad just to watch Netflix, then put an M3 in a Mac for some serious computing jobs. That&#39;s crazy.  The ipad comes with a state-of-the-art keyboard which makes it good for productivity like the Mac. Why would someone buy a $3k+ ipad when it can&#39;t do the work of a laptop a macbook air with a touchscreen and 360degree foldability would be rad ngl That’s why they don’t have touchscreen laptops @@lyon1556 Very few people will be spending over $3,000 for the iPad. I&#39;m not sure actually how he got to $3600. I just spec&#39;d everything out and it only came to $2600, and with the Apple Pencil and magic Keyboard it was a little over $3,000. I spent about $1,800 including tax, the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard (about $1,300 if you subtract my trade-in). If I decide to upgrade again, I imagine that I wouldn&#39;t have to upgrade the Magic Keyboard or Apple Pencil. This could possibly be my last iPad though if I can replace the iPad with the Apple Vision Pro. I&#39;m still debating that.<br><br>Obviously, they will be putting the M4 in the MacBooks later on in the year. Maybe they needed the M4 for the Tandem OLED.

There is absolutely nothing to complain about.<br>I don&#39;t really agree with you about having the iPad run macOS. The iPad works better as a touch screen and the MacBook works better as a non-touch screen. They are just two completely different devices that serve different purposes. @@didiervandendaele4036none of their products are bad … @@drewmorrisonyou can see people all over the internet wanting to replace their Mac with iPad.

All I want is iPadOS in the next update to reimagine itself for the M series iPads to introduce a Samsung Dex style interface.

Now waiting for other company&#39;s to make their double oled layers screen. Sweap big screen on laptop for small 13 Inch hmm no no.  Min 17inch hope for 20 inch in future. We need a Bend test &quot;Why I bought it&quot; to flex that you have more money that us. 😂 Ipad 9&gt;&gt;&gt; It wont replace your laptop. The ipad doesnt have a keyboard and can&#39;t be propped up by itself. Trash Don&#39;t forget that you are supposed to make a smartphone better than Iphone PWAs are the future of apps and apple is ruining it. Does it have a calculator ? I love the new  background Great time to buy older iPads now 🔥 This makes the previous iPad Pro more satisfying 🎉🎉🎉 I bought a robot vacuum cleaner and it came with a small remote. I was disappointed that it wasn’t controllable from an app on my phone. I’d much rather have an app. You’re way more brainwashed than I expected 😂 I think apple made a mistake by releasing the m1, m2, m3 etc too quickly. Apple used to have a decent re-sale value when it was the 2015, 2012 etc. now i think the&#39;ve tanked the re-sale on the older m2 macs and could potentially put the next wave of buyers off. That toothbrush part <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> looks sussy It&#39;s mad that Arun is quickly catching up with MKBHD on subscriber count. Bro earned from his expense Imagine buying products from one of the greediest companies in the world. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s thinner than paper, I wouldn&#39;t even pay 10% of that criminal price for this overhyped Netflix watching device. I used to like Apple when I was younger but for the past 5+ years they just seem to test the limits of how much their cult like fanbase are willing to over pay for anything with an Apple sticker slapped onto it. Shameless scam from one of the greediest companies out there if you ask me. I wait for the day they fly too close to the sun, and fall off harder than Blackberry did, altho I don&#39;t see that happening any time soon unfortunately. I use my ipad as a daily driver as a student. I have had the ipad pro m1 128 gigs with keyboard and pencil for so long now might as well buy a Macbook Pro 😂 Well since you don&#39;t need your Mac I&#39;ll take it off your hands lol You talk about being able to use your tablet without touching the screen, isn&#39;t that the whole point of a tablet or one of the major points? Why not just get a laptop at that point? Speaking as someone who uses an iPad everyday at home as a sort of combination book/video split-screen player and LOVES the handoff feature so I can keep reading on my phone as I leave the house and transfer right back when I get home.. yes. You will have to buy an iPhone. Sorry. Arun where did you get your chair. You need a laptop for video editing, we need a laptop for coding, we are not the same bro.<br><br>As powerful as it is in terms of numbers, for most people it&#39;s just an overpowered Netflix machine. Obviously it&#39;s a laptop replacement that would make sense for you because your use case for a laptop is primarily video editing, but for most people it&#39;s still far from being able to accomplish work related tasks whether it&#39;s because of architectural limitations and OS limitations. <br><br>Now a cool concept would be a hybrid between iPadOS and MacOS, like how Windows 8&#39;s &quot;touch mode&quot; worked, allowing you to switch on the go. Far too uncritical. It&#39;s obvious that the iPad is basically useless for anyone who doesn&#39;t draw with the Apple Pencil. iPadOS is the biggest limitation and makes the device almost useless and completely overpriced. Google docs on ipad is still bad tho... For some reason commands for adding footnotes do not work along with some other things... and that&#39;s a big issue for people who are deep into word processing (like lawyers etc). still no native calculator app, why? An ipad is not a macbook. ipadOS sucks for productivity. period. The thermal throttling will be crazy 🥵 ⭐️⭐️ They should make a Smart Folio for the iPad Pro 13 inch like it’s with the 10th generation since I got the logi combo touch and it’s nice but I just want apple to make it for better quality and I hope they make it… Os is still ipad OS though, Why would I buy this instead of a full fledged MacBook with a better OS I would say the iPad Pro is totally worth it for the specs you don&#39;t need, at least for 99.9% of the buyers. I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s good only for artists and people who require to do video shooting and editing on the go. Obviously for techies and people who has money to spend to experience the latest and greatest, as there is a difference in experience in screen and pencil tech. If I was 15 years younger I&#39;d get one just for the tech as well. But today, I&#39;ve become an average user with average needs. A MacBook Air + iPad mini has become the perfect combo for me. I&#39;m still using the iPad mini 5 btw, and still great for media consumption (no gaming) You can buy a  gaming laptop with crazy on that price btw which I think would be better. Nothing beats that Samsung S24 Ultra IPad is the best @Mrwhosetheboss i hope u take a look at samsung tabs because what apple does wrong samsung does good for example Spen housing is much better solved, could be interesting video You get into ipad initially thinking it is freeing. Most people do. After the honeymoon you can see the frustrations building. You will start missing the versatility and stability offered mac or pc. The lack of solid external drive support really made me disappointed. And your life become hanging and juggling through docks and adapters.🙄 Mrwhosetheboss are you okay man? you look kinda sad 😕 Until ipad can run Mac OS, I won&#39;t ever buy a new one. Using my ipad pro to do anything serious is infuriating. I prefer Android to iOS, so why the hell do I need a giant BS iphone!? 😂 I actually loved the scene in this video. Great work guys! The fact that you cant have more than 1 instance of an app is a deal breaker for me. And power point sucks ,screenshot to your clipboard doesnt exist. Just so very inflexible to use! I really don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d pay that much money when you can just buy a more powerful PC with a removable screen Apple fanboys are starting to be like christians. They hate everyone and everything that&#39;s not stamped by Apple.<br>People can like both. And each has it&#39;s pros and cons. I cannot wait for this review. My main questions about Apple products remains.<br>Why so much money on a tablet, when a surface is way cheaper, even with a keyboard and a pen. And you are always forced to buy their (expensive) products. And yes, even the surface pro is too expensive considering the what the top phones do. There the same no one is buying apple products alone for a useless oled panel tablet that should have been years ago like come on now I would love to see the iPad tested with Goodnotes.<br>I use a 2021 standard iPad with Goodnotes for school and I am very happy, except the size because I have to zoom in to be able to handwrite… I need a new iPad, maybe it’s time to bite the bullet In Australia here Arun,just specced one out to the max with pencil and keyboard $5277 AU! bro please gift me a ipad😭 Dude what u do is just basic, just buy it or use some outdated ipad, it will work for your use case Man didn&#39;t just sneak his wedding announcement in😊😊😊 There’s only thing I’m drawing with an Apple Pencil. Please don&#39;t expect me to have sympathy for you being able to afford this tablet. There are still PDF files that can only be edited with a Mac and not on an iPad. Even with Adobe Premium. It’s frustrating, especially when I don’t have a laptop with me and only an iPad. Is there a work around to this that Google hasn’t been revealing to me? Until legacy computing is obsolete which will happen eventually. These ARM devices can never replace PCs and Macs (Macs have their own problems now that they&#39;re exclusively running on ARM). iPads are still in a losing battle because they&#39;re now needlessly using an inferior OS for no reason other than to keep both Macs and iPads alive. Can certain people use an iPad for everything? Sure, but there will ALWAYS be that one thing you do that won&#39;t work on the iPad or a different tablet. I&#39;m not even talking about things like gaming here or niche stuff like server management. For an example, look at browser extensions. If you&#39;re going to be using a tablet like a laptop, odds are you&#39;re going to be using the browser sometimes. You probably have extensions you rely on. On Android, there are janky third party solutions to get those extensions but not on the default Chrome browser. Assuming Apple doesn&#39;t even touch the word &quot;janky,&quot; there&#39;s probably nothing like it for iPad OS. Lots of things you can’t do on an iPad yet. I run lasers, so no Lightburn, no Silhouette, no Google Chrome extensions.. just to name a few. Basically most of the things I do on my Macbook aren’t even some version of an option on iPad. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=451\">7:31</a> samsung should start using snapdragon x elite or plus on their table Now to wait for jerry to snap it in half Vs tooth pick You only need a subscription for every app you use on the iPad....

So expensive for a kids toy I got an ad for it 😂 Another apple ad for overprice sj**t that Samsung has been doing for years with galaxy  s tab since 1800 To expensive, still just a large phone. Stick to the MacBook Air. iPad is very far from the MacBook, I have the two&#39;s but for productive and fast tasks, the MacBook is very far from the iPad.. I don&#39;t know why I watch these tech vids and I even don&#39;t have these cool gadgets and not planning to buy This amount can get me a midrange studio 😢 would rather pay 3000 for ipad or 1000 for 2 and 1 and 2000 on sick set up.. this price point being soo high makes no sense and this is only reason why the macs don&#39;t have touch screen...

Apple will release this, then push huge OS upgrades later on that will render this slab useless and open to security vulnerabilities and then blame you the purchaser of the slab for causing e-waste and contributing to the climate issue. 3000 bucks to play app games, that is a bit expensive isn&#39;t it ? Its really shocking how they always finds a way to disappoint the audience and users.. Please do a review on this. M2 iPad Pro 12.9 user here: have seen absolutely nothing that suggests this is worth upgrading 😐 Arun apple glaze gotta stop man. Wait until you start using the iPad for signing PDFs and reading documents. Also the HDR for knocking together thumbnails is a game changer and the video experience is amazing Because you have money and we don&#39;t... When the tablet is more expensive than my RTX 4070 gaming PC 💀💀🙏🙏 Absolutely nothing in this video convinced me that anyone should be spending that much money on what seems to be half a laptop. What spec did you go for in the end? Still unsure about the nano texture glass! Not the thinnest Apple product... Forgot Apple cloth? 😂 DO NOT FORGET AC ADAPTOR. IT IS NOT INCLUDED 😂 That toothbrush clip though😂 The most ridiculous thing is that a power adapter is not included in EU and UK versions. The greediest company ever Bro is still trying to overtake apple without noticing he&#39;s about to overtake mkbhd YOU JUST BOUGHT IT CAUSE YOU HAVE MONEY TO WASTE. With (still) shit called iOS it will never replace MacBook, because MacOS, and accommodating software is light years ahead for productivity then anything on iOS. Anybody saying different does not work for living with computers, period. (a few video editing apps do not count)<br>If Apple would add opinion to add MacOS to M series iPad Pro&#39;s (which would be 2 months work for them, now that SoC&#39;s are the same) then you have world&#39;s first proper computer/tablet combo... Arun&#39;s videos are so good,i&#39;m watching them even though I&#39;m never buying 99% of what&#39;s reviewed on his channel and i&#39;m enjoying them alot Overpriced, overhyped expensive walled garden device. Dream on For schools where you need the back camera and you need a touch screen where a phone isnt allowed. That is when you use an ipad One main problem with tablet is that web browsers doesn&#39;t support any add on exteions especially Chrome. I&#39;m just waiting on iPads to get the whole Desktop experience. Then I&#39;ll be ready to switch from my work laptop to this, the weight of carrying it around is a huge factor. Then I&#39;ll consider buying it. I like Samsung&#39;s Dex on their tablets and it .. kinda works, but it&#39;s not there yet. That&#39;s what I&#39;m waiting on Apple to provide (if they ever will :/). Now it&#39;s feels like , my Ipad pro m1 11&quot; yepp still a perfect shift for me. . . . .🖤 No, it&#39;s not a good idea. 900$ for the extra 2TB of storage? Istg if I see one more &quot;I liked my own comment&quot; I&#39;m gonna lose it Can&#39;t do app development on ipad.<br>Even my hp laptop takes lot of time to build the app. It is slow The screen isn&#39;t as good if you look on it at a slight angle it feels matted out as showing in other reviewer videos. I&#39;ll stay with my 10th Gen. Introducing iPad Ultra M6 and after all these years we have worked really harder on this..<br>A charger in the box.. Just kidding<br>&quot;A sim ejector pin&quot;<br>&quot;Obv High price tag&quot;<br>&quot;Nerfed MAcbook version fr&quot;<br>Just for 8690*5 Euros.. Is the iPad a gaming version of MacBook Air? Just add a touchscreen and 360 hinge to MacBook Air and be done with it Apple Samsung has been doing that fir awhile now For storage, I would recommend some sort of NAS solution. There are loads of great options out there. Get one where you can run Tailscale and connect to the NAS remotely. As for the file system, that’s the main reason I have to use a real Mac. I need access to the command line interface via terminal for remote server administration and the ability to ssh into network infrastructure (firewalls, routers, switches, etc.) <br><br>I’m super impressed with what Apple put together for his new release but wish they would finally let us use the full-on computer they’ve built to its potential (and they way we both want and need) <br><br>If a computer is a bicycle for the mind, then the iPad is still  one of those rides in front of the mall you put in quarters so your niece can pretend she’s a big girl. I bot an ipad and it lasted for a week. I rarely use it anymore Can I get that😢I love drawing I just ordered one too. 256 13” pro. And a pencil. I also have a remarkable  AND a SuperNote <br><br>I just like writing. I watch a lot of content and although I can do that on MacBook, I’m more concerned for MacBook safety and iPad…<br><br>sometimes I’m working on a car, motorcycle, woodworking, or cooking or some kind of project where MacBook is just too fragile. Im always concerned something will fall on keyboard and whole laptop is ruined. But iPad, I’ll put on rugged case and I’m fine. <br><br>When I’m outside is kinda weaker point cuz screen isn’t as easy to see but then I’ll just use 1 of the e ink tablets Squeezing the pen makes a menu pop up? That sounds amazing, sounds like something Samsung should have done years ago 🤔 so the quetion is why you buy an ipad set with all the macbook functions? Or you could buy a 2 in 1 laptop, having access to both a real OS that can do more that watching youtube and do all the iPad stuff at the same time. Less battery life? yeah but what use is more battery life on an oversized iPhone? And yes you can do all of those android apps thanks to the magic of VMs Honestly, even if it is POSSIBLE to replace a laptop just with its raw specs and usability, it&#39;s not enough to justify the price point. A tablet for 3000+ pounds or 4000+ USD if you include the accessories???? That HAS to be a fking workstation + gaming rig replacement if you want to justify that price point. Like seriously, with some good deals, I could build a damn good desktop with that money and still have leftover money to get a decent laptop enough for any on-to-go work I might need to do 🤣🤣 Maybe even throw in budget tablet just for watching Youtube or playing some light games, which I am more likely to be doing on my tablet anyway than editing 4k videos or something. Isn&#39;t it better value just to get the mac air at that price? Hi Arun! Have you ever tryed Linux? I don&#39;t think you would like it but it would make for an interesting video! Y don&#39;t they just make a Mac touch screen and add bit functionality...... I&#39;m 45 years old and even I consider Apple products to be products for the boomers. It&#39;s oversimplified garbage; and you bought one because you&#39;re a boy-fan. it&#39;s like a Ferrari that can reach 350 km/h put you will only go 120 km/h ever. Its so thin it can cut off your finger😂 Pun, pun, pun, puuuun.... 🤡 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=594\">9:54</a> except some software is 10x worse on iPad Very specific apps that 95% people not gonna experience anytime soon He is paid to say that he never uses iPad or iPhone for work Me watching this on my 7-year-old iPad like 👁👄👁 that smart brush b roll.. The ipad is probably the best apple product <br>Except for the locked down os which will have new app stores in 6 months <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=344\">5:44</a> &quot;Wow&quot; Basically touchscreen nerfed MacBook. Lots of folks have tried this. iPad OS file handling will be your undoing. &quot;How ugly do you want the Ipad Pro 4 background to be?&quot;<br><br>Apple: Yes Apple usually picks some nice backgrounds... This one is a stinker. Yeah no. Fuck apple product prices Now just imagine if Apple makes a 2 in 1 device. I will buy it (once it’s affordable) just to watch Netflix and youtube on it because it has a gorgeous OLED screen. I will also edit videos on it etc but mostly watch content 😁 iPad battery life is still disappointing by current MacBook standards AS &#39;SnazzyLabs&#39; Quinn said. The M1 chip, yeah, a HUUUUGE improvement over the Intel chip at the time, but Apple are experiencing &#39;Diminishing returns&#39; with their chips. As each generation goes, (it&#39;s ONLY only in it&#39;s 4th gen now!) They are going to see less and less in performance/efficiency gains! At some point &#39;Soon&#39; they&#39;re going to have to decide, ramp up the input power (and expect higher temps and less battery life), or make the chip physically bigger (and expect higher temps and less battery life)...<br>😎🇬🇧 Nah. I would get a heavier iPad if the battery was longer lasting. No wall hugger for me. I was planning to replace my 12.9&quot; M1 (512GB 5G) but the new iPad Pro is underwhelming. Lets look at why: <br>1. The 512GB and less models are 25% slower (Only 3 P. Cores)  This is the top of the range model in the iPad family. Why have they used pixel binned SOCs?<br>2. Having to purchase a new pencil and Magic Keyboard - No thanks <br>3. My Phone has OLED and yeah, its good but £2000+ good? Nope. <br>4. The Magic keyboard has had the Maclike gestures for years .<br>5. As much as I enjoy iPadOS and can do 95%+ of what I need to do on it, its still frustrating at times. And I often dock mine with a Caldigit Dock, ultrawide, Mechanical keyboard and MX Master and have got used to Stage Manager, but its still inferior to Dex on my Fold 4. (I dock that too :) ) <br>The iPad Pro needed to add a second TB4 port. <br>I am  waiting for the new Samsung S10 Ultra.  I&#39;m hoping the new SOC its rumoured to have will be as fast as M4. <br><br>I can work very well on my iPad Pro,and from experience  you are fooling yourself if you think you will replace a Macbook with one. <br><br>Still I love how many &quot;influencers&quot; have ordered one for their Youtube/Social Media and no doubt most will be returned once they have uploaded their content. It’s sad to see how Apple can’t keep up with their top position (I’ve been using exclusively Apple products for 15 years and am also own some shares). Lol, i found a apple fan boy after a lot of time. @@Abu_Tuesday unfortunately, I am :( @BrandonLeProktor a ce niveau demande le feat But it&#39;s still an ios I absolutely disagree! Having an app literally for everything I use is the most annoying thing! Websites are way more convenient, they don’t take up space abs don’t make my phone phone look like a cluttered mess! That thigs gonna snap like the 15 pro max😂😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=600\">10:00</a> eh no. Whenever a company directs me to their “app” rather than their website, it’s usually a dreadful waste of shoestring code in an attempt to get more data on me. Just look at the British Airways “app” which pretends to be an app while it mostly just loads a web browser with limited functionality The only ipad you should buy is the cheapest one. And only for your toddler. Nah, I’m fine with my $30 onn tablet… That was the most far from reality review I&#39;ve ever seen. The Ipad is still limited by its OS, and nothing on your routine needs has been improved by the new one,  compared to the old model. Why isn&#39;t there a video praising the functionality of the m2 ipad, or the m1 air,  that endorses the possibility of it become a one-and-only design? Ipads are still toys, as any other tablets. I absolutely prefer my MacBook Pro to my iPad. I just keep dreaming of Apple adding touch, pen, and 360 hinge to MacBook Pro... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=337\">5:37</a> Iwas laughing too😂. The M4 chip will help me watch YouTube with less lag yay! I literally made this decision a couple of months ago with the Huawei platform. Best decision I have ever made ! So many 1st world problems for the 1% in one go I can’t keep up 😂 I at least expected to have an ipad in your hand ... but its a horrible click bait OMG :/ Did any one notice bros window? Where iPad will never replace macs.  Developers, product designers. Basically all tech people in all IT industries of the world. <br>I spent 1 week using figma on my iPad. Nightmare. <br>Unless they change the OS and somehow make pc apps work too. New iPads are pretty boring tbh. Just a better version of the older ones. The iPad is still no alternative to a MacBook because of ipad os I&#39;ve replaced almost all my tech, including multiple iPads, Macbook, and iPhone, with a Galaxy Fold 5 and touchscreen laptop dock. One device capable of going from one of the most one-hand friendly phones on the market, to mini-tablet/ereader, to full size tablet and touchscreen laptop, to 80&quot; smartboard in a classroom,  without signing into an app more than once or pay for more than one set of internals. iOS has an advantage in software, and performance, but the new iPads are frankly still just perfected 2010s tech and nothing like the experience of a true single device experience that the 2020s deserve. Add to that how Android has an actual desktop browser, niche as Kiwi might be, and these new iPads no longer interest me who was once one of the biggest supporters of iPads. No matter how good it actually is, im not paying that absurd apple tax for a tablet of all things.<br>Holy hell thats almost 3 grand. Wtf... I’ll do 2 push ups for every like this comment gets… That’s why i bought iPad Pro…. One year later. Huge mistake. iPad os can never beat laptop … so many limitations.

The &#39;Anti-reflective&#39; screen coated versions - according MKBHD - neuters the famous OLED &#39;Pure Inky/jet blacks&#39; to be more like LCD grey/black colours, and, aint as sharp in detail as the regular screen too. So, NOT ONLY do you NEED a SPECIFIC cleaning cloth for this screen (not to damage it), but, how will a iPencil affect it also?... Probably not very well... And it&#39;s a £/$100 option!!! &quot;Apple is as Apple does...&quot; 😏🤣🤣🤣<br>😎🇬🇧 I think the Achilles heel will be the battery life...(And the price obviously) iglad I watched this to the end :) The only reason you would get an iPad is for the nostalgic home button... Thats the only reason I have one, but I barely use it. Just spend your money on something that has more value like the tab s9 ultra, but if you already sold both your kidneys like me get a tab s9 fe+ is this how all apple consumers cope? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=631\">10:31</a> “They Not Like us” Kendrick Lamarr Reference wait how?

Why make it so expensive though. Anyone know what that game Arun played around the midpoint is? Would you give me 1 ipad 🥺 Beggar I am sorry, but I cannot agree to this.<br>1. The main thing is that hardware is unmatched, absolutely outstanding. It&#39;s just that iPad OS is the main limiting factor.(This may be subject to change after WWDC)<br>2. If you aren&#39;t a graphic designer, an artist, or anyone needing a pen and notebook for their professional work, the Apple Pencil pro really does not give you any real benefit over the standard Pencil 2.<br>3. Apple hasn&#39;t really fundamentally changed anything about the iPad Pro. They did things no one asked for, (Apart from the function rows of the Magic Keyboard, that is something nice). The iPad&#39;s display was already brilliant, especially the mini led. I don&#39;t think anyone thought the iPad Pro was thick or heavy(The old Magic Keyboard is different though). I would say the M2 was already an extremely capable chip. I don&#39;t think anyone thought it was slow, even for the pro apps(correct me if I am wrong).<br>4. You can get 90% of what the M4 iPad Pro is offering in an M1 iPad Pro. And considering the price jump that apple just did, the M1 is better deal for me.<br>5. The &quot;Pro Apps&quot; on iPad OS are nerfed ones from the Mac.<br><br>This is my perspective of what is going on. The new iPad&#39;s are brilliant, it&#39;s just that they aren&#39;t justifiable for an upgrade from a previous iPad Pro(I am talking about 3rd generation or later). The reason I am being so harsh on iPad OS is that Apple markets this tablet as a computer replacement, and for most people iPad OS would be fine. But you are really just better off with a Mac unless you really need a touch screen.<br><br>Arun&#39;s ideas are amazing though, not gonna lie. I never had really thought of the iPad Pro as what Arun described, especially the cellular part(but I might just be better off using my phones wireless hotspot) The new &#39;Ultra thin&#39; iPads... I see a &#39;JerryRigEverything&#39; durability/bend test coming soon... iPhone6 &#39;Bendgate&#39; anyone? 😏😉🤣🤣🤣   😎🇬🇧 I will not be buying one based on my experience with ipad Air 4. My biggest problem with iPad is keyboard including  the build-in virtual keyboard, the handwriting key board and the external keyboard. My logitech keyboard worked well until recently in which certain keys are not working. There was nothing wrong with the keyboard as it works well with my laptop and android devices. The handwriting keyboard is also problematic. When I highlight text, the handwriting keyboard disappears. To get it back I have to close and reopen the file. That is very frustrating. I had years of experience with samsung and huawei tablets and I have not had such a problem. I love ipads especially the bigger ones I&#39;ve had about three the only problem I have with them is if you constantly pick it on the corner there&#39;s a lot of stress put on the the screen as it&#39;s so thin and sure this is what&#39;s happened to my last ipads it was always the screen that broke Gaming on an iPad sucks as well. Come on, you&#39;ll say anything now. No matter what hardware you put inside, the only thing holding back the iPad is the iPadOS. iPads got better chips to do what most budget laptops do since M1 and nothing drastic or new happened with M4 iPads. iPads are not going to replace laptops for all because again, no matter what, they are mobile chips with few wH, this will always keep being a hurdle in adoption of iPads as an alternative to PC and talking about games, well... RISC is good and efficient but CISC is much more mature and development is easy for CISC. Still if you just look at the raw performance of the Intel or AMD (any CISC based chip) and compare it with an equivalent RISC chip, you will find them beating RISC. I personally am great admirer of RISC architecture but some things are simply just too vague to claim atm. This new iPad is good but still the biggest problems with iPads remains... it&#39;s not the chip, it&#39;s the operating system... it&#39;s the iPasOS. Really redesigned??? I don&#39;t know if this has ever been asked.. but is it apple or Mkb... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=962\">16:02</a> <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/HvgfY93GEYmqvwLUuYDwAQ\"></a> Such a Fanboy.....3600 USD nothing for him man I remember youtubers saying the same thing about ditching laptops with the last pro ipad. But they quickly changed their mind because the OS sucks. the ipad is really great but sooooo expensive 😭😭 I&#39;m going to sell my kidneys 😂🤣 makes a case for the surface pro really, the only downside is the chip. 2 months later: I was wrong - iPad cannot replace my MacBook And cracked screen will cost arm and leg @@dragm2123Screen will be fine I bet, but in the Apple event you can already see people holding new iPads, and they are bent. Yeah... no... &quot;Why I just bought it.&quot; Because I can afford it. Ironic that someone can afford a device because they can describe it to the majority of people who cannot afford it! you are not gonna switch 🤷🤦 I just realized that I am listening to a sh*t. This entire video is all about him and his life and opinions. Its not really helpful for the regular consumer that doesn&#39;t have an entire Jarvis AI powered home. Just 300K more for beating the Apple yt channel, lets gooo! I&#39;ve still got my M1 ipad pro and the thing I hate the most is the aspect ratio for watching videos and shows. The amount of empty black space on the 13&quot; looks so ridiculous Thank you for sharing your great insights 🤙🍻 Just use a pen and paper damn ☠️☠️☠️ I know people complain about apple prices but they are a business….if you own a business you are looking to make profits…plus nobody is forcing anyone to buy apple products 😂😂😂😂😂 people talk about apple product they complain but then they are the first people to buy it . I have always used android phones last year a switched to apple and I must say best decision ever It is my mac replacement Why? It&#39;s called consumerism Bro is rosting samsung tablets Yes why carry a tablet, when you can do much more with a phone especially with the folding phones that can literally be turned into a tablet  but can be carried as normal compact phone. Its always exaggerated until some months goes by... Wake me up when apple will decide to merge the laptop with the tablet software. The hardest part is the will to give up all the money from all of the shepple that are buying all that it&#39;s Apple! MAYBE JUST USE A SAMSUNG BOOK 4 PRO 360............... LOW PRICED TOUCHSCREEN AND WAY BETTER &#39;&#39;/ Bend test ? Glass is glass and glass breaks !!! You just bought it because they are not going to send you a review unit this time?? 1000 dollars merely for the brand name. Hell no . There goggles failed so now there going to try and sail an iPad for $3600 . <br><br>Apple is losing sells <br><br>Apple - let’s increase the price even more . <br>Damn I like apple but this company is getting more and more stupid You have the price wrong. $3600? Where did you get that from? im a 8 tb kind of guy 💀 Why not just put mac os in it , maybe modified so ppl still buy macbooks Rocking my M1 Ipad Pro, crying I can&#39;t get this one 😂! But in all seriousness, as an artist, its pretty for an &quot;update&quot;, but I dont see myself upgrading over mine. Yet the new features look nice. respect man. Love your videos man When apple stops being cringe about storage costing hundreds to THOUSANDS of dollars extra ill consider it. There&#39;s no reason a 256 gb to 512gb should cost $350 extra...the 256 is $2199 Australian dollars and the 2tb is $3949. That&#39;s JUST the storage. What a joke. that&#39;s one of the many reasons i don&#39;t buy apple products, as cool as this is. picture this <br>you study technical chemics/maths/physics. how you gonna take notes? (hint: not with a keyboard) how you gonna train calculating?<br>1000sheets of paper per year (30€ + pens)<br>or a graphic pad (60€) that you can USB to your laptop (500€) (which btw feels a lot better to write on than an IPad and lasts like 5 times longer) and lets you use a proper OS<br>or an IPad (3000€) + pen (200€) + charger (200€) + a backpack with 10kg of protective stuff for the ipad (200€) + apple care bc you very well know that thing breaks regardless (+500€) + an Iphone bc youre now in the eco system ( probabaly 2000€ too idgaf) + a mac and an apple watch (2000€+500€) + apple care for those (500€) + additive constant for apple things i may have missed or features that may get added in the future (5000€) + dongles (prolly 100€ too) + chargers for phone,mac,watch (300€) + probabaly apple care for the chargers and dogles too (50€) + inscription fees for uni of arts (0€) bc you just got thrown out the scientific one for failing that iq test.<br><br>... i forgot where i was going with this tbh. do you guys think, that if i stick a apple sticker on my 5 dm³  300k€ Cs watch that i will look as premium and rich as 75% of americans? (I always use three of those to tell if one is off) Yeah, nice publicity, but my old iPad Air is still good. Sold out again. Finally you can afford M1 or M2 IPads 👻🤩🤭 Ok, looking forward to your review after you daily drive it to replace your macbook air and e-ink tab for 2 months. They even freaking mentioned moving that front facing camera to the landscape side as feature 😪 i think if you find yourself needing to buy a keyboard for your iPad then really what you needed was a laptop! Damn. Apple is going crazy with this pricing model. thank you, sir, you didn&#39;t answer my Christmas Emai love all that you do, and thanks for this awesome video they need to combine ipad os with macos for the ipad to reach the next level.

OR at least add touchscreen and pencil support on new MacBooks. But my main question is @Mrwhostheboss, where do I get one of those sweaters? Looks super comfy! iPad has Final Cut Pro but it does not have Premiere Pro or After Effects. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=602\">10:02</a> worst take of my life waiting for the jerryrigeverthing bend test &quot;Apple&#39;s genius lies in its ability to charge exorbitant prices for minor tweaks, making customers feel like they&#39;re getting a steal of a deal every time they empty their wallets.&quot; &quot;We were living in a PC first world and swapping your laptop for an iPad, it would be seen as a move only filthy casuals would make&quot;. That line took me the FUCK out, who knew Arun was so funny 🤣🤣 As someone who has a MacBook pro, iphone and an iPad I can with 100% guarantee say I haven’t touched my iPad in probably years, the Mac is so much faster when using for video editing, music editing or any heavy software stuff while any other stuff my I need to do my iPhone handles it, sure the case could be made that the iPad is the start of the 2 in 1 phone and laptop but we’re probably 10 years or even more behind in apple development years to getting to that point of making it work, I genuinely think this is a niche product for certain group of people, however it’s a start from apple that can change the iPad section forever. &quot;I always feel wayy better when a product tells me to use their app, than when they direct me to their website&quot; what kind of a twisted psychopath are you Arun! 😂 This idea that IOS can be your main OS was really loud when the 11&#39;&#39; ipad came out. <br>Lots of promises, but they didn&#39;t deliver. <br>Not. Even. Close. puns are getting worse but a sub is ieasy :p For some reason, even though you produce fantastic impartial qualityful movies, when it comes to Apple items, you sound a little biased or fanboying a tiny bit over their product. It should just have the macOS, it has the hardware for it ... and it has still the garbage ipadOS, does not have any good app for file handling .. Once I tried to bring only my ipad to a holiday to backup my photos from my camera, and it just wasn&#39;t be able to format the external drive ... I said ok, backup to another SD, let&#39;s select today&#39;s shots ... and I couldn&#39;t, it didn&#39;t have the feature to select a day&#39;s photos, but was able to group as days ... the most annoying OS I ever met, it would be a dream to use as a photographer if they would be able to solve file managing, but now it is only a good piece of metal to draw on :( Can you imagine Microsoft unable to produce close to apple... i mean any product... full garbage when there is windows issue we need troubleshoot and find solution by googling by right microsoft need come with solution and simplified it.. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=114\">1:54</a> not a full on computer.😢<br>A disabled tablet with noway to utilize it full potential 😢 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> really showing us who the real boss is dude 😂😂😂 @@niravparmar7856 😂😂😂😂 💀 What 💀 😂😂😂😂 i came looking for the toothbrush comment.

Worst idea I ever had 😂 iPad OD is horrible for multitasking, especially if you are using Figma or dealing with tracking software like GA/Hotjar etc...  It was a joke and a total nightmare 😂 iPad OS* Why i just bought it: because you have to much money. There is no need for this Ipad pro at all.

Now, if I was rocking an MacBook Air, that might be more interesting - because those are pretty light and have a full featured OS.

They are actually targeting financial intuitions, and others who daily drive Chromebook or surface.... <br><br>When iPad will be able to run xcode and vscode, and give a terminal to use. Definitely gonna buy one, whatever the price will be. I never had a dream of buying these gadgets as my dreams can&#39;t afford it and in reality using 3 year potao phone to watch this......... Good night Arun.. Nice video btw.. Trust me, I&#39;ve been an ipad user since the Ipad 2nd gen, even before I started using smartphones. Whenever I try to do work on an Ipad, such as using Google Docs or Canvas or Google Sheets, the functionality just isnt there. Everything is simplified to the point you can&#39;t really get a detailed result without an actual computer. They might add this gadget and that feature to the Ipad, some apps might even have all features as those on a fonputer, but overall it is a pain in the ass to work with and is so time consuming.<br><br>If you need a tablet to watch videos and play games, Ipads are overkill and great at it. If you need to do light loads on the go, Ipads are a viable option. But if you really wanna get work done, you better still keep a computer, because Ipads are just impostors trying to replace computers to no avail, at least for all these years its been this way. As always people hate what they can’t afford. I don’t know why they expect apple to be cheap. It has always been expensive. And the same people who are complaining have an iPhone and all. Spoiler: He wont replace his laptop. Reason: iPad OS. ( Unless they update it soon). I sold myself the same lie he is selling himself a while ago. The hardware isn&#39;t the problem. Its the software They need to be able to run macOS for anyone to consider them a laptop replacement. iPadOS is way too limited for most workflows I found it ridiculous that you iPad air is heavier I&#39;m thicker than the pro. All these are decent argument to buy an iPad, just not a reason to buy newest M4 iPad in particular, any modern iPad will deliver similar enough experience. Laptop replacement? Lol, because you are replacing a MacBook. If you use a Windows laptop, you can’t replace like that easily unless you’re a boring user who won’t be gaming and no freedom to use the system. I tried this whole iPad instead of laptop and notebook. In my opinion you still 100% need a laptop (Mac or windows) alongside the iPad. iPads are fantastic for notes. All I’ve used this year is my iPad for college and I’ve never felt more productive. All my notes in one place. Yet some tasks were just not plausible on the iPad (with the Magic Keyboard), like doing an assignment on Word or PowerPoint. But Arun, run an experiment for yourself to debunk this. My experience could be different to yours. I did this. I got an iPad when I was in university to draw and take notes. For doing any sort of coursework or typing, you need a laptop. The Folio keyboard didn&#39;t cut it, the feel wasn&#39;t the same, window management wasn&#39;t good etc. You could do it, but why, when there&#39;s a better option there. For gaming? PCs/Macs and consoles exist with actual hardware controls (so a controller or mouse and keyboard). Yes, you can use bluetooth to connect them to your iPad, but then you&#39;re restricted by the hardware inside that tablet (not so much now with the M chips) and the software whereas for big games the PC and console exist. That&#39;s changing now, but you&#39;re restricted by screen size then on an iPad. For mobile games, the smartphone exists and it&#39;s more portable and better suited for gaming on the move. If you don&#39;t want that, the Switch and Steam Deck exist.<br><br>So outside of YouTube and light browsing (assuming you don&#39;t draw, take notes or photo/video edit), what is it good for? A computer and a phone are more general purpose so you&#39;ll likely find something to use them for I love how, when discussing doing work on a device, literally all youtubers talk about video and photo editing, as if that is what we all work on. 😂 Right?? That&#39;s what I was thinking lol that&#39;s because that&#39;s the workflow they&#39;re most familiar with The only thing I’ll do is use discord, play Roblox, and watch YouTube @@jaydenleckpa8381 iPad 10 be like Exactly 💯. Youtubers think the pro use case is photo and video editing mostly. Agreed. They even run benchmarks on how quickly a bit of kit will export video...a use case for a tiny minority of users Because it showcases the over all speed of the device Its because this is specifically targeted to people who review these devices. They do edit videos, so they will appreciate it and hype about it. Very sneaky marketing. Well to be honest that is really the best application for it. Wow they are talking about what the device is made for, thats bad I never do video editing on my ipad, i never do photoshop images on my ipad, i never use office tools on my ipad,… i just browse the web, look through my email, watch youtube and a bit of facebook. For me this ipad is utterly nonsensical. For other tasks i can not use the ipad: programming arduino, writing some silly pc programs. So no, certainly at this price point, a big no for me So this the thing big and small YouTubers discuss this because this it what they use it there content creator they CREATE CONTENT so it makes sense be honest do you really need to know how fast Netflix app opens or how smooth the safari runs if so go to smaller channel that uses it the way you would use it you wouldn’t go to karate class and expect to learn yoga. I hate to tell you but most not all do want to know how fast can a project render how smooth is creating graphics design or sound design @@manojgailThe iPad Pro was designed for artists, editors and application developers. It has MANY other LITTLE perks that other people may enjoy, but they are minuscule. If you are not a creator and you are purchasing the iPad Pro instead of purchasing the iPad, then you mid as well set your money on fire. The capabilities that these creators are going over are the biggest changes between the last version and this version, it is extremely important for many of us to know what we are purchasing before we do so because we don’t want to get a machine that won’t work with our type of art style. If you are interested in this because of how thin it is, again, the normal iPad is the same thickness- buy that and save your money. I mean, those are very demanding activities for a computer, and even more for a tablet.<br><br>The majority of people who work on laptops use super light stuff like Excel, or programs made for pentium 2.<br><br>The most demanding right now are 3d modelling/animation, something that this tablet most likely can&#39;t do, but is also something that very few do professionally. That is sooooo true, i was gonna mention this. Like for what i do for my business using an ipad and a full blown pc is more useful for me I&#39;m an IT major so basically everything I do requires windows or Linux. I just enjoy his vids. I don’t think they even use iPads for video editing except for review purposes. Video editing workflow with computer is way better Well gee golly garsh, how dare these YouTubers not learn how to use every app!

Like I have problems with office for Mac, let alone the version for ipadOS! Swift playground that is currently some kind of replacement for xcode is just a joke. I can only imagine that people use that for publishing apps only, not developing them. There are so many other use cases that almost everybody prefers to do them on a pc, not because these devices are weak, but because the OS is not what they need. I am doing video editing, coding, casual music production, and graphics design. But all of those aren&#39;t my job (yet). What I know is that Excel on iPad is unusable because it doesn&#39;t support pivot tables. I also know that the Office suite on iPad sucks. Coding on iPad sucks, but video editing is fine, still inferior to a laptop. Music production on iPad is fine, again less functionality. Same for graphics design, which I can utilize the Apple Pencil but the desktop app is still better. <br>The conclusion is that the iPad is useful for me when using my laptop is difficult.

Opting for a walled garden is asking to be abused by both the hardware vendor and the software publishers.  Ain&#39;t that right Sony? Try it out and see for yourself Arun. You’ll have an amazing experience as long as you use it the way Apple intended for it to be used. Start trying to do more or even have some windows open in different sizes and you’ll notice all the issues with it. <br><br>There’s just so much friction to do simple things and don’t even get me started on how files are handled on ipad os or ios. <br><br>Apple would never allow for this ipad to shine with all its limitations just so this doesn’t cut into macbook sales. Apple also does not want the ipad to a replacement for a mac book. Thus, ipad OS will always intentionally be hobbled. Even if the insides are identical to the macbook. It really depends on who you are and what you need. For media consumption/creation it will probably be enough. For a tech guy that occasionally needs to plug ethernet to configure a network, that codes, test and creates programs, that have 3 monitors and actually use everyone of them, that use his laptop to flash isos and format drives to use with other machines... well the ipad it&#39;s just a portable monitor, you will always need a basic windows or mac laptop around. bro u just need smart toilet Its still a PC heavy world where using a phone/tablet instead is still being looked down as casual user only behavior.The only features where phone/tablets are better is entertainment due to being able to use them in your bed to watch something.Portability too i guess but laptops still exist Title: “why I bought it”<br><br>Because you’re a tech reviewer and this’ll give you a lot of clicks.

What It&#39;s 2024 and basically any productivity laptop over 1000€ has LTE/5G from the factory or optional. I have ipad air 4 with magic keyboard, ipad pro 12.9 2017 edi , and Fold 5 .... These super inflated prices are like what potato PC&#39;s use to be back when they first started to roll out in to peoples homes. THIS is why i dont get angry at people who just like apple because of its features and ecosystem. i get it man, i really do, but there are people that praise apple for everything it does ever, and look really stupid when apple continues to do garbage business practices, and they just ignore it or dont acknowledge it, as if they know that doing so will make them look less credible. or who obsess over it and argue with other people who dont like apple because of said business practices. i hate apple because theyre unfathomably greedy and extremely stinky when it comes to how they handle their consumers, but i can recognize the pros of using apple devices in specific use cases. i myself may or may not eventually wind up buying an older iphone just so i can use the face tracking on it for 3d avatars, but thats literally it. So spend some 3500eur on iPad then some 700eur on keyboard and pen and you are set for next 12 months There is only one use case that might justify this thing and that is if you are an artist and you want to design with the pen and I am still not sure if you can&#39;t do that in something cheaper like iPad air. Any other ads showing doctors or engineers holding the thing, is just flexing. Real work is done in real production machines, desktops or powerful laptops. For starters, after so many years of developing this thing, they should have been able to put a proper OS to even consider it as a serious candidate. Wow That&#39;s just incredible 🤩 Will it bend easily cause even if we dont bend it its so thin it might bend with time and usage. Pls someone answer Arun: im an 8 terabyte guy<br><br>Me with 256gig ssd on my laptop Personally, I prefer my Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 plus. I get a tablet for media consumption and reading, the S9+ screen aspect ratio gives you a better experience, not to mention the better multi-tasking, 4x speakers that sound great, more precise Spen with finer pen tip.<br>Most importantly, I love the Samsung casing which the back cover and the front covers are magnetically attached. If I need a keyboard, I will remove the normal front cover and attach a keyboard cover. If I want to watch a movie, play games or even reading, I can just detach the front cover, it&#39;s so QOL...<br>I love the way S9+ stores the spen as well with the case built for it, the pen just feel really together with the tablet unlike apple pencil which still feels like 2 different items separately. The new Google Circle to Search feature is godsent...<br><br>For those who need productivity, yeah, Ipad will have better apps and speed for it. Android and Apple have both became so similar and efficient that it&#39;s not Apple and Orange comparison anymore like that it used to be.<br>Anyway, great to see more innovations coming in, be it Apple or Android. Just makes the world better... Except the increasing price tag... Haha... It seems like MrWhosetheboss is falling into the &quot;iPad will replace my Macbook&quot; trap, from which he will find out that they block so many features from the iPad, for this exact reason, to not lower the sales of Macbooks, that using it as a replacement is impossible.

I paired that pc with an M1 ipad pro for when I&#39;m on the go and I&#39;m all good. The only problem is the  OS environment, its hard(maybe its just me though) to transfer my work from PC to Ipad pro or vice versa. I need to use other prgrams to do that....The new Ipad pro looks awesome but for this year I will actually choose MS Surface pro It&#39;s crazy how apple doesn&#39;t even put their computers in chronological order. Like 1st the M3 Max, then the normal M3, and then the M4? I think you got a winner here! The combination of less weight then a laptop + laptop performance + apps is the future Can&#39;t wait to hear your experience 15 percent weight drop is pretty great! for the 13 inch model only, the old 13 inch was too heavy for me I wonder if this solves my problem Thank you Mrwhosetheboss 👍👍👍👍😊😊 Mrwhoestheboss Just an Apple shill these days I can&#39;t wait for Jerry Rig with this one.

I can&#39;t ever image buying one for 3 grand. would love to learn about how you&#39;re going about planning your smart home Another option for extra storage is a NAS, LTT done a lot of videos and helped a lot youtubers set those up. It&#39;s your own private cloud that you don&#39;t have to pay montly subscription for. There are off the shelf plug-and-play options from the likes of synology, and there is the DIY route. DIY is no harder than building a PC and installing an OS on it, for the most part just Lego it together and write a bootable USB stick with something like TrueNAS, plug it in, go through the installer and off you go. The hardest part of the DIY route is probably making it accessible over the internet, for someone who never done it it&#39;s gonna be a learning experience (unless TrueNAS has some built in features and proxies for that, I don&#39;t know), but other than that it can be done in under an hour. And then you own the hardware, you own the software, no subscriptions or anything like that. Maybe some small fee for a proxy server and\\\\or domain name to make access to your NAS easier. 5.1 mm thin 🤔 someone bring out JerryRigg everything 😂 Welcome to the inner dialogue that every man has, trying to justify his upcomming techbuy that he really doesn&#39;t need 😅😅 An ipad cannot replace a computer. keep having slide up and switch apps and pages, less app flexibility and external device limitation. @Arun do you not remember bendgate 2018? ipads have been here before, i hope they made improvements the rigidity in comparison to last time.

I must say that, I am still on the fence, in terms of pricing. But overall it seems to be a great product. <br>BTW, I don&#39;t know if you are aware that, you are now so close to beating Apple. Just 400,000 or so to go. Here comes the phone you promised to make 👍 If Apple is not careful, they might be in the position where Sony Xperia was back in 2014 with the Xperia Z1. It was so thin that it came with a manufacturing defect where the screen would brake (perceived as a thin line, almost like a hair on the screen) due to the phone being so thin and due to the phones heat, it would cause this issue. Will see what happens. It does always feel like the different apple products are all competing against each other almost as if they’re seperate businesses entirely I love Apple \\uf8ff The greatest tech YouTuber that ever lived ❤❤❤<br>Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩 £2800...you dont need it X Elite Surface Pro 10?

It will be a bit of an investment to start up but you will end up with reliable, easy to manage and upgrade, locally hosted and safe solution. Just give me m4 Mac mini Get a job kiddo This is obscene considering it costs as much as my macbook, and the reason is mostly for aesthetics! Tab S7 💪 def not buying it when my only use case is yt and anime. for work i like paper and pen I bought another useless tech that i already have. <br>Here&#39;s the new title 😅 You brought it to show off how rich you are. This is the untold reason. hmmm sunset Fun Fact: - video shoot took full day as it was light outside window at start and dark at the end. bros a master waffler Apple need to seriously consider give up ipadOS and put MacOS on ipad pro. Just use ipadOS on other models. Is the ipad considered an ipad anymore?? tax rightoff So, now that you won&#39;t be needing the MacBook, I will forward you my address to ship it!!!! 😂 apple vision pro so advance then apple went backwards with these😂 Hopefully one day we can run Xcode on an iPad Can&#39;t wait to sell my second fliter bean All this power and yet limited by IOS. Not sure if I&#39;m the only one— But I kinda like the &quot;clanky&quot; feel of using a PC, especially one running Windows. To me, it feels like part of the whole user experience which I like so much, and that&#39;s also why I find it hard or &quot;weird&quot; to switch to Apple, because everything is so &quot;round&quot; and &quot;smooth&quot;, very uncomfortably so. Yes, I will never deny how efficient and overall better their products are, but those same products remove this clanky feel I love so much (also, by clanky, I don&#39;t mean slow.) Adding onto that, I absolutely hate the icons in both ios and Mac The issue with iPadOS is that your Apps working is predicated upon Apple not kicking it off the Appstore The most impressive part it&#39;s that the new 13&quot; Pro it&#39;s almost identical to the previous model. A bit more power, weight reduction and a marginally better screen, but none of the ports, sustained power, versatility or outstanding battery life of the Macbook Pro&#39;s. It&#39;s unbelievable how much the marketing it&#39;s messing with our brains and seeing people fall for it and thinking this improvement makes it able to do way more than before.<br><br>Never buy an Apple product thinking it will help you replace 2 products or you will end up having 3 devices more than the apple vision pro💀 lol , how greedy apple is and how fool people are . <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=219\">3:39</a> nither agree nor deny😂😂 Bro&#39;s really just made a samsung s9 ultra for 3.5 times the price lol. I use my iPad to video editing so I can use my 💅 This isn&#39;t even a full review, but you&#39;ve covered this iPad so well from a variety of viewpoints that really raise questions for users, not tied to one particular review format.  The way you look at every aspect of the advantages and disadvantages compared to the iPhone and Macbook is very interesting, and it&#39;s all presented so neatly and easily understood.  Extraordinary. The ipad insta app and other apps that can scale will forever infuriate me. Scared of what&#39;s gonna happen when Zack @jerryrigeverything gets his hands on it I have m2 iPad Pro and see no reason why this one is any more worth the extra price . after some years we will be getting mac lvl performance on a apple watch!!! XD Apple keep cooking the same shit with just a minor upgrade <br>Comes with a big price tag and some of you guys keep hailing them for making this crap they call iPad just to chop our money <br>Is high time we consumers shine our eyes <br>We deserve better than this shit 😂<br>Never buying 😂😂😂😂😂 What a disgusting video from one of the most popular tech Youtuber! <br>He doesn&#39;t even understand what a computer means. These guys think if they can edit a video or a photo it&#39;s enough for a powerful machine with M4 chip.<br>Meanwhile we wanna do professional stuff, like installing jdk, python, write code when traveling and compiling sh*t. <br>I understand it&#39;s meant to be for normies but why give it a powerful chip, to do what? Phone was never meant to be a gaming machine, yet here we are.<br>How the heck is it pro, when pro can&#39;t use it? I am waiting to get Lightroom classic and I am jumping in Arun sometimes just randomly thinks a decision and while thinking he hits the record button What a rip off Thats a high praise The prices 😬😬😬😬 moral of the video tablets are useless and must be less expensive to buy , and yaa that old greedy apple less innovation more price About the storage problem of the ipad and the smart home. I as an IT Homelabing Professional recommend you to build or buy a server, there you can make a NAS (network attached storage) so you can access you data from anywhere. I mean look at Linus Tech Tips Whonnock. Its propostorous. Its 2,5 PETABYTES in space Anything, good or bad, can be justified. Still thicker than my Honor Magic V2 Bruh your a multimillionaire, your hovering over the buy button over $3600? I love your YouTube channel don&#39;t forget that you can also use your iPad Pro as a &#39;second&#39; monitor on your Macbook at any time,, I find this especially useful when editing photos on my Macbook Or buy a 4k monitor for a tenth of the price. Spending 3600 on ipad and same on vision pro and it feels like iphone 16 will also be more expensive than ever. Is it IP-rated? Display’s a W. Haven&#39;t used a tablet since the old Samsung note 8s and what not. The last one was the remarkable paper tablet and only recently just started looking for a tablet to be able to work on digital art while on the sofa. But for those prices, Apple just will not be a choice even though it has one of the better drawing software available for it. the iPad is Apple&#39;s Cayman, and the MacBook is Apple&#39;s 911. The Cayman will always be artificially limited to not overtake the 911. Could you do a video of the best affordable laptop for work that&#39;s yet good for gaming? <br>I need one that&#39;s not labeled as a gaming laptop, but has a good amount of storage for games like genshin and MC and illustrator, multiple pdfs and files<br>If there&#39;s already a video about that could anyone give me the link please? <br>Thank you I am actually surprised that no one talks about how a pro machine is thinner than the iPad Air. I mean that’s the  point of an air machine; to be thinner, lighter and easy to use and handle. I don’t get why a pro machine is thinner than the iPad Air. Remember when they pulled this same shit stunt back in 2016 with those thinner MacBook Pro that took away those ports and brought about dongle life. Yes people, that is what Apple has decided to do with the iPad Pro. They are still missing the point after all this years that no one’s wants a thinner pro iPad that will take away all the functionality of a pro machine to fit its new form factor. No one buys a pro machine for it being thin rather than getting the air iPad. They buy it for the performance, functionality and grade improvements over the air. Bro started in the morning, ended in the night for a 16.1833 minute video. 🙇 didnt know you needed a big phone for 3600 dollars where as you can get like 6x more powerful gaming pc for the same price Binod Should I go for 2024 air or 2022 pro? Does it now have a calculator? Another bendgate incoming U good man is the pencil nib (tip) for the new pro pencil the same as the old one (which is the same for pencil 1 and 2) ? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=729\">12:09</a> the guy in the background xD i dont know why im watching this after knowing im never gonna afford it I&#39;ve bought 3 iPads, and Everytime I get caught up by the hype. But after a month it sits quietly in the corner. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=826\">13:46</a> eh on ta vu brandon 😂 It&#39;s just getting silly now! The price is insane, specs totally unnecessary! It&#39;s like buying a Ferrari with only 1st gear! Clutching at straws to bring out something new that’s not needed. But people will still buy the 2tb model etc etc for Chrome, Netflix and Photo browser. I really don&#39;t like the apple eco system.<br><br>The only reason I would get an iPad is to use Procreate I will do 1 push up for every like on this comment<br>Should stop There is no value add to any tablet, yet - as long as it is not supported by the right OS and apps. So I’ve had an iPad 2, iPad Mini 6 and now iPad Air 5 and each time I try to use it as a laptop alternative, I always end up using my phone and MacBook combo cos iPadOS just never cuts it. The iPad will always be just an iPad so long as it’s restricted to iPadOS. Apple pencil 2nd generation, does not work on the new ipad. wtf. This is literally the newest Apple Pencil until yesterday and it doesn’t work. Just put McOs on the ipad and i Will buy it but for now there is no real reason to upgrade or buy the new shiny one When you have to give so much justification for a device that means you dont need it I often draw up concepts for a product. 😂 never lose touch. Never lose that. Theres only 2 main uses I see for IPads. <br>For young kids (not old enough for a smartphone) during long boring stretches outside the home to entertain them... and for professional users such as yourself or artists.<br>I cant see myself needing a tablet in my home so its just something I&#39;d use on the go.<br>If im carrying a tablet, it needs a bag of some sort so might as well just carry a laptop if I need it for the power/productivity.<br>Plenty are thin, light and battery efficient enough.<br>If I want to game on the go... well just get a steamdeck or switch.  I doubt the Ipad really has any substantial games that arent on phones, and tbh looks like a nightmare to even try to game on if it had a full library.<br>The pencil is cool, but that is quite niche. I think id rather buy a notebook and pen or just get a galaxy with one if i really needed that.<br>And for what you paid? I can get a decent 2 in 1 laptop, oled steamdeck and a new last gen galaxy fold and pen.<br>Nah. Just nah Spoiler alert: you won&#39;t have any semblance of a usable file system at all. Can&#39;t wait to bend it like iPhone 6 Plus I switched fully to iPad Pro in 2017 and sold my Mac. The most “Pro” thing I do is music production. I recently bought an M3 Pro MacBook Pro and after a few days I returned it and decided to wait for the next iPad Pro. There is something that feels very 2010 going back to Mac once you’ve used iPads as your main machine for so long. App experiences are way better than browser experiences in most cases and I just can’t go back to the Mac. Why you even bother to explain? At that price, the people who can afford it only need one reason to buy it, because they want it. <br><br>The rest are just people with poor financial decision. i can&#39;t take your reviews seriously anymore Now that you and MKBHD have gone gaga  on the hypepads, will wait for the Jerry Rig show!  That will help me decide if I should buy this as a weapon or as a clipboard. Buying a $3600 tablet is not &quot;smart&quot;. Switchin&#39; from a Mac to an iPad won&#39;t cut it unless iPadOS gets a proper overhaul for everyday folks. Day-to-day stuff like printin&#39;, scannin&#39; docs, shiftin&#39; files, and the Stage Manager feature are a bit of a joke, mate. When you wanna get somethin&#39; sorted on the spot, your brain freezes up &#39;cause it just doesn&#39;t click in those moments. The iPad&#39;s ace for entertainment, sittin&#39; just right between your iPhone and MacBook. Me: Looks nice<br>Goes back enjoying this on my redmi pad A laptop replacement? Sorry, but I&#39;ll just never get over how bad the mouse and cursor work on ipads. Bro DEEP throated his tooth brush 💀💀💀💀💀💀 I always feel much better when I&#39;m not forced to use some company&#39;s app, as that has major data privacy concerns attached to it, whereas simply using a website, thanks to ad- and scriptblocking, doesn&#39;t. When is the wedding? I still have my 3rd gen iPad Pro that I bought second hand for £500 and the last gen pencil. With an off brand keyboard and track pad case it basically does the same thing in terms of laptop-ish functionality. I still think it’s heavily nerfed by iPad OS though. Not having a conventional file system is kinda rubbish for “pro” work and you still end up duplicating files within apps own storage area. Until they change that, better off going one step further and getting a MBP, unless of course you need the pen. Still no calculator? Does it have something like DEX?  Or is it just another high powered  tablet with no place to go.... dont know about this one.... but the previous versions allways felt like a muscle car with lots of power , but is crap on the track because it has crap handling in the curves... Just finding the button to report it ! I sell ipads but am not interested in using one make sure you let us know your long term thoughts on the matte screen and if you have any build quality issues with the thin-ness the ultimate baby shark watching machine I’m genuinely afraid I’ll bend this iPad if I were to carry it in my bag. I can’t imagine anyone asked for the iPad Pro to become even thinner. They should leave that to the Air. It’s in the damn name Because you have disposable income and can’t help to brag. I miss the outro music… All the perks of a laptop ? That&#39;s quite the reach, just the basic perks which almost any tablet can do (email, keyboard, etc) One of the key things it still lacks the ability to code . It would be so cool if it could run xcode on it .. Simple.\\xa0<br><br>You bought the new iPad so you can post about it on YouTube and generate ad revenue (for those that don’t use adblockers). <br><br>I like adblockers. Ngl Xiaomi pencil is better That thick bezel though... Someone once asked me &quot;are you that dumb to be needing that many smart things in your life?&quot; and honestly there&#39;s really no good reason to be relying on smart things to live your daily life except as an excuse to not remember stuff or taking good care of yourself by needing gadgets to do it for you. I pad make sense if you are into digital art. Apple have been slowly balance the use case for iPad, iPhone and Mac for years- improve one over the other for sometimes only 6 months just to makes every category still sells. They could easily only sell Macs or only improve iPads to a point to stop selling Macs but need that balance to sell both and make the most money Arun now you are doing it wrong brother …. I hope u understand. In this vid you are almost pushing people ( forcefully) to switch to an ipad which is soo wrong. Remember one thing an ipad is an ipad no matter how powerful it is but a mac is a mac. You cannot  try to influence people to opt for a iPad instead. 😷 this is soo worng &amp; yeah btw this is your worst video ever this video deserves a dislike.  👎 as if  apple paid you to make this video. This video is soo uncomfortable to watch &amp; understanding that the amount of reach youve got &amp;  how people may subconsciously oopt  for an iPad after watching this video @mrwhoistheboss Too thin and doesn&#39;t look durable. <br>Thin isnt s thing when you put it in a case.  Where&#39;s the Mini? Don&#39;t do it, its an insane price. Couldn&#39;t they have just shifted the Apple Pencil magnets to the bottom of the tablet? Imagine someone with the whole ecosystem of the keyboard, the pencil and the iPad who wanted to upgrade.. If you want something as a replacement for a laptop it is stupid to buy an iPad because the iPadOS cannot run the apps which run on MacOS. Why dont you instead buy something like a Galaxy Book 4 360? It is a laptop with Windows and when you flip it around it becomes a tablet with the support of an S-Pen. What&#39;s that writting tablet? Can you please do a review on it I think with this price I can get a RTX 4070 with i9 13th gen PC with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD.. 😌 For it&#39;s price it&#39;s trash I really appreciate your hard work and the entertainment that you bring us with your videos. Thank you so much ❤ how reflective is the screen because normal oled tvs are like mirrors. and using oled tvs in the dark is a great way to destroy your eyes. so i wonder how apple fixed this for their ipad pro when using this in the daylight My pc costs more than that I know you are a hype man, everything tech is hype, but this ipad will break that streak. It is an amazing piece of technology. Except it is 100% useless. The software holds it back. It cannot do anything properly, all features are the worst possible solution to make sure not to step on macos territory. Unless apple updates ipados there is no point in upgrading / buying this. Have you heard about minisforum v3 windows tablet with amd 8840u inside? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=156\">2:36</a> that dual stacked OLED looks insane it looks edited 😂 Me watching and laughing on Android tablet Cracking, highly entertaining video.  Ditch the grey sack though, Arun, makes you look very bulky.  Love your stuff.  That tablet is worth more than my car.... Which eInk pad are you using please?  Link?  Wedding invite movie- Drisha climbing that wall- publish here please! You can have cellular on iPad without having a plug in modem. Wow, the price increase is almost 50% since iPad pro M1. Long time ipad user here, also I am a developer. I love my ipad. I use it everyday but 70% of the time to take notes by writing, 25% of the time to watch something, 3% as a second screen to my mac when I am traveling and 2% random apps, chrome etc...  Other than that, it is nowhere near to replace a laptop. This is by design. I hate Apple for this. They are not allowing us to utilize the hardware. You can&#39;t even code on it properly. My sister who is aillustrator love it of course. She utilizes the hardware way more than me. But my point is it&#39;s not even close to replace a laptop. I only recommend it if you can afford it or expense it.. You can buy an &#39;A&#39; grade  M2 11&quot; ipad pro 2TB cellular from cex for £1150. I was originally thinking of getting the new air 11&quot; 1TB cellular but that would be £1249. So £99 more for half the storage and no 120hz. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=493\">8:13</a> this line felt like an Apple presentation 😅 “ 5 x “ emphasized , it’s okay you don’t have to feel guilty for wanting the new fancy tech , you’ve earned it bro ☺️ I hate Samsung so much Using your views to pay for ridiculous priced iPad 2.8k nice trick.  BTW I have an M1 iPad pro and see no reason to change Ugh. You completely brushed over how absolutely obscenely overpriced and limited this is and just hyped it start to finish is just 106% fanboy. Probably the most unbalanced review I’ve seen in ages. Jerry is getting ready to zig-zag that screen and back. Carter , give mommy back her iPad.. This seems to be  a huge upgrade for the ipads and the the company itself Well... If you can find what to do with it.. Then awesome.. But in my opinion? If you think the iPad would replace your Mac... Considering the limitation of apps for iPad OS... Then I don&#39;t see any reason you can&#39;t use Samsung&#39;s best tablet.. It&#39;s also as thin, and powerful for tablet use cases.. Plus, you get more games all while being cheaper.. <br><br>Honestly man, I know you don&#39;t mind the expense, but if you really feel you can replace your work setup with the iPad.. You would be completely fine with Samsung. <br><br>I honestly don&#39;t like the fact that we encourage these companies to price their products ridiculously. <br>Why not sell the whole gadget together. <br><br>Why would a pro user buy the iPad without the pencil and folio if they (Apple) claim they want it to replace the Mac.. <br><br>It&#39;s just like selling the Mac without the trackpad and keyboard.. Just ridiculous.. We, by we, those who just rush and buy apple products without thinking it through properly are the reason they keep charging ungodly fees (just as MKBHD put it) for their really not so innovative tech.. It sucks.. Because you want to review it 😂 I used to have an ipad mini 4, but after i bought the iphone 14 pro max i havent used it. All that money just to watch Netflix on .... With portable devices you sacrifice quite a bit for the portability often the price and the power ....apple found the secret which is to charge a lot of money for everything lol For me, it&#39;s definitely very tempting for all the same reasons. Can&#39;t wait for the nano-ultra-screen to find its way to Macbooks You can&#39;t run adblock on iPad OS; mouse support is pathetic. You&#39;re better off on a MacBook Air You probably never heard of Adguard. It works on Macs as well as on the iPhone/iPad/Android Let&#39;s not go down this route again. The iPad might seem like it would be good as a laptop replacement but the reality is that you will encounter situations where you can&#39;t do what you want to do and would have been able to do it on a Mac. I&#39;m typing this on my 14&quot; M1 Pro MacBook Pro and still loving it. Zero desire to upgrade. Maybe the M5 Pro but even then, my M1 Pro doesn&#39;t hold me back so I&#39;ll probably just save my money. when I started watching this video I got an advert for the new ipad Bro im watching somebody who doesnt like tablets by a 3600 dollar tablet while im watching on a old ipad air 😭 I use my ipad pros as my main computer when I&#39;m out and about. M1 is plenty fast for any music editing, recording, composing. Definitely more useful than a laptop for my use case. Do you connect an Audio Interface to your iPad? @@RabianskiT I&#39;m a pianist so my &#39;recording&#39; work is done via midi controller keyboard so no. Got an interface at home plugged into my pc for any vocals etc. it isn’t a replacement it can’t do nearly as much as a computer Worst Apple ad ever No rick roll this video?, shocking How much did you charged apple for justifying such a ridiculous price ?😂😂 You say samsung tablet still use mobile chips 😂😂, while also admitting that ipads are powerful but can do much less work than macs, due to software Extremely powerful social media machines😂 I have an m1 iPad Air and I use it all day at home. I’d say it was worth it for me considering how much I use it but there’s zero reason to upgrade it. How powerful of a chip do I need for the limited ipad OS. I think stage manager is the best iPad OS feature since it makes the iPad more laptop like with the multiple windows but I’ll be damned if apple think I’m ever upgrading to a more powerful social media machine for £2000. I get they don’t want to take away from MacBook sales but that really shows how money hungry they are. Ipad is overrated <br>Don’t know why but every tech youtuber promotes ipad guys, if u are broke, its ur problem STOP with the THIN. give us battery and features Forget about the power and price, some of apps like Instagram doesn’t have an Ipad optimised app they have iphone’s layout. It feels such a waste of screen area when you open it I can&#39;t wait so I can check emails, and watch youtube on it! bro literally made a video from day to night bend test finna be wild with this one 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 This video will not age well. Also, are you using Remarkable because it does something the iPad cant or because its a eink display Imagine getting this and the apple vision pro for almost the price of an old car  💀 As a programmer, I must say, tablets are decades away from having a use case for me. I&#39;m a laptop (+ external displays) / smartphone kind of guy. I doubt this comment gets like😅 Can it survive the bend test? I Don&#39;t really like thin devices, they are easily get bent, 😅, i also prefer a bit heavy for grip,<br><br>Thin and light device make my grip a bit loosen, scared to damage (i do gym and my grip is a bit strong) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=698\">11:38</a> the netflix app for pc can do that too the first minute explains why i never had an ipad! &lt;3 I think we&#39;d like to think that replacing a laptop to a tablet/ipad is the dream but in practice its just never as convent as a laptop. M4 + being super slim, having no active cooling hmmmmm here comes extreme throttling Please get a prenuptial agreement Mac isn’t bad for gaming, its just the lack of games. Minecraft is a good option but you can also play fortnite, cs:go and other games you could download<br>of chrome Since the iPad 2, the tablet is my most used computer. Phones are a pain for to do anything other than communication, the tablet experience is in a different world. Meh...I remain unimpressed. Great some will like it, but this is absurd amount of money for the extra, extra device. Knowing Apple: I will be shocked if you will be allowed to drop MacBook for this one. That ain&#39;t how they operate. I expect enough shortcomings on each device, for people to keep both. Yeah, this product is certainly not for me... Honestly extremely niece and... Quite frankly I don&#39;t know if it does anything better that already professional, similarly priced drawing tablets do + With left over for something like... Oneplus Tablet lmao. Why is the size of the bezels equal to the square surface of Great Britain Bro called us Poor in 8 Terabytes ways 😶\\u200d🌫️😐 My brother, my sister, I know, life is hard. You are probably going through a very difficult time, and you have the impression that it is getting worse and worse, you don&#39;t know who to confide in, because the world is turning its back, your family can&#39;t understand you, or maybe -maybe you&#39;re simply afraid that he won&#39;t understand you. You are no longer sure of having real friends, you no longer sleep at night, you are tired, mentally, physically, spiritually. This world calls you weak, and you start to believe it, you are desperate. Know this, God is with you, he sees your pain, your suffering, your loneliness, and he wants to help you and is just waiting for that. But for that, you have to open the door for him. God loves you with a love so pure that he sent his only son Jesus Christ to save you from death. So return to him and your heart will be at peace. BE BLESSED 💖💖🙏🙏 Hey arun try the Samsung s9 tab ultra and compare with apple&#39;s tablet ZENLESS ZONE ZERO You can&#39;t develop software on an iPad, that way it will never be a laptop replacement for developers. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=44\">0:44</a>  ayo 😮 Finally Arun Talk about Ipad for the first Time 🖤 The problem with the iPad with a keyboard was that it was thicker than the MacBook Air so what they did here seems great. But I do fear for battery life… Maaaaan ,I don&#39;t think we give you enough credit for that, but you really make tech interesting and your videos are  just sooooo enjoyable. I am just waiting for &quot;tech purchases I retreat&quot; video... Pretty sure there will be an Ipad I dont need to watch this video, as soon as in the apple presentation the guy says &quot;there is no such a device in the world&quot; when speaking of a fucking tablet, I know its just a marketing brain wash thats all. Some cheap chinese tablet which is 10x cheaper will do exactly what this over priced piece of shit will As an apple fanboy I’m spending the more or less on a gaming pc. Apple needs to get a grip! Quality of their products is declining and prices climbing. that toothbrush clip was diabolical You have 18 million subs, you can afford an M4 iPad. Ipad Air 13inch is 😍😍😍 Another clickbait thumbnail, hum? You don’t have the device, man… think mkbhd&#39;s impressions were a lot more grounded than yours You&#39;re deep into LSD of Apple product or you value ur money less... you&#39;re reaching a bit too hard to justify your purchase, and the things you&#39;re listing you&#39;ll definitely end up doing on your phone most of the time i think Pin me bro I reckon he will go back to his macbook during a week Iphone 15 pro was kinda the same choice for me in terms of AI, I like to know what my device will be able to do before buying it, the fact you still don&#39;t know the battery capacity is wild, especially with a super thin device, Apple defo hiding the battery life from people and thinking they can fix it with an update... This isn&#39;t the 15 pro so lets hope they can pull it off again, I did visibly notice the Ipad they had on display in Westfields battery was draining whilst plugged in running the video editing app (forgot the name of it) but that&#39;s kinda concerning... hopefully it was just a dodgey charger. Arun is tempting more than the apple event I am watching this video and I only thought the product already exists, that lenovo laptop which has 2 chips and 2 os. Which is windows and android, whichever you want to use??? We all love watching products we can’t afford That thing is gonna bend so easy, don&#39;t do it man, get an iPad Mini and keep your laptop, it will cover the needs you metion in the video US $3600 for a tablet? Wow, the price you pay to surf the net while lying on your bed. $3600 that&#39;s a lot of cash for reading newpaper in bed. i’m so pissed that if i wanna buy the ipad pro, i need to get the new keyboard. my previous magic keyboard not being compatible is infuriating This is Cocomelon machine😂 If too expensive then get a galaxy tablet it has the spen in the box at no extra charge but no charger which is cheaper than buying Apple Pencil pro it has an amoled screen same as s24ultra. It does all the same things as ipad except m4 chip in ipad is overkill Watching it on M1 iPad Air 5 🫠 Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! a dark room saying that he&#39;ll prove a product mmm <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=618\">10:18</a> why does iPadOS not use the desktop class web browser that Macs have? Let’s start there. Fix that, and then we can talk about upgrading. does this mean the last gen gonna be cheaper? Bro are we not getting any review on the new Huawei P70, been waiting for you 😒 to review it.. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=735\">12:15</a> hahaha notre BrandonLeProktor national Price is insane. Samsung S9 ultra and you could still buy a cheap car with the change. Love how nobody can use their old magic keyboards again! Can’t wait to hear your thoughts on this amazing piece of technology once you had it for a couple of weeks! It&#39;s a great device, but not much different (in functionality) with previous years.  It needs a better OS really, to take advantage of the powerful chip (as MKBHD suggested). Thinner = shorter lifespan <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=360\">6:00</a> can&#39;t wait for him to download instagram on ipad and completely flip out then realize there&#39;s no default calculator app 😅 Dude ipad doesn&#39;t come with the YouTube app on default but that doesn&#39;t mean that iPads don&#39;t have youtube😂<br><br>You can easily download calculators from appstore<br><br>And yes the Instagram sucks on an ipad😂 Not usefull as software hinders the power this chip has the $3000 tablet is real You can&#39;t get visual studio, vs code, or any Jet Brains&#39; IDEs in an IPad. The fact that he started recording in Morning and Ended at night...That&#39;s called Dedication to Perfection!! 3600$ well jump in guys, it&#39;s limited offer 🫴 😂 , wtf , where did the 999$ tablet gone? , i think apple thinks that all of us have 5k salary or something to come with this price range witch definitely it&#39;s not worth it and will never be DAY 1 OF ASKING ARUN TO GET THE OLD OUTRO BACK They made a surface pro but for 10x the price Funny timing of this ipad release,,, since arun just made a video about the costs of having apple products repaired....<br><br>Those thin ipad pros are definitely going to be expensive to have repaired. well... Using word and microsoft paint isnt something that&#39;s new to tablets. imagine spending nearly 3k on something that can be stolen or broken in seconds, just because its light. But I guess its pretty smart to review whilst purchasing it, &quot;let me make a video of me buying the Ipad and that will pay for it&quot; My 2 year old son will love watching Bluey on this.... Nice tablet. Just a shame it is made by Apple. Very interesting video. Since stage manager I use my iPad Pro M1 more than my Mac for the reasons you stated. Side note you can just link your android phone directly to your iPad Pro and import photos. I took my pixel 4XL on holiday for using as a spare camera (unlimited uploads free) and then just linked it to my iPad Pro and copied all the photos across in the photo application. No AirDrop, no problem. I also swap to S24 Ultra and I use the app Blip to substitute AirDrop, is brilliant. Bro, doing everything to convince himself to buy an apple ipad.<br><br>Mac has bigger battery<br>Mac has a steady hinge, you can work while commuting.<br>Mac is faster.<br>Mac only needs your mobile wifi. Ipad cellular is too expensive.<br>Mac has mac software support.<br>Mac is cheaper than ipad.<br><br>Please don&#39;t make your self fool. You have the money, just buy it. Nice haircut vro The background music is loud and annoying. Love the video though I always said and will say this again: &quot;Laptops are gonna be obsolete one day replaced by tablets, whether you like it/believe it or not&quot;. Feels like this video has been made by someone after every single iPad release. When it won’t even replace the Remarkable in the end. Apple needs to do something similar to Samsung dex for the ipad. So allow Mac os to run on it. They&#39;d sell like hot cakes with a more desktop experience. I’ve ordered one. I’ve had the 2021 iPad Pro for a while now and the blooming has been a constantly noticeable thing. More than anything I’m really excited for the switch to OLED I love tablets. But this is overkill. Great computer so how to run localhost server, browser inspect element, terminal, xcode, android studio or vs code? Oh wait... Definitely concerned about a future that is primarily on apps. You lose a  lot of functionality in terms of being able to compare prices and have power over your own web experience. You become locked into their ecosystem and their ads. I feel like continuing  in this direction only makes that problem worse :/ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=75\">1:15</a> tablets r mainlt focused on digital artists, buissness nigaa , architecture njg, editors a lot I wouldn&#39;t buy a tablet from Apple because they have too many shortcomings.  It would be better if you bought a tablet from Samsung I bought the M1 iPad Pro when it came out thinking it could replace most of what I do with my laptop. Turns out iPad OS just really sucks. It constantly reminds you that it’s not a real OS. A really simple example - compare the print menu on iPad to a Mac. Might not sound like a huge deal… until you need to print something and you can’t rotate, enlarge, print two-sided, etc. Tons of small things like that you don’t even think about on a Mac but are really inconvenient or impossible on an iPad. So now my expensive-as-a-laptop iPad is basically just being used by my son to play Roblox. The Japanese has a word for this &quot;ii-nah&quot; - literal translation to - it must be nice. That must be nice. Why didn’t you feel that way about the M1 or the M2 iPad? Because….. 🗣️ IT’S THE SAME THING Thank God I&#39;m not an isheep <b>iPhone 6 flashback</b> Sounds like you’re just happy being away from home, meeting some colleagues and some apple guy has sold you the story of why you need an iPad. <br>Dude, stop acting “sheeply” and spend more time with the misses instead of hyping an unwanted product. It&#39;s the opposite for me. When a company tells me to use their app, I&#39;m repelled. Most shop apps are phone-screen-framed websites anyway, just give me the website app on the website. I&#39;m not going to hoard 100 apps for 100 shops. day night different Did you see the sunset how long did it take him to take the video That&#39;s a lot of money for a tablet. It would be cool if they could integrate MacOS into the iPad Pro like a surface book. He needs to stop talking about his wedding to Yoko Ono. No one carers if he’s gay. Really dislike how there&#39;s 4 different pencils now and they only work with specific ipads. <br><br>Mad You know why benchmark apps are faster on iOS? Because they are optimized for that specific platform. Android phones are so varied in CPU and RAM configuration that it&#39;s not possible to optimise for it in a general way. So when you see single core performance being higher on an apple device, it&#39;s because the software used to make that benchmark is optimised with that architecture in mind. Does it have lidar I NEED TO KNOW 👹👹👹👹👺👺👺🤡👺👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹 does it have a calculator tho? No one optimizes apps for ipad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=364\">6:04</a> wow tilt sensor, absolutely never seen before years ago on devices that cost 1/3 the price yo i was in the apple event live i left each 10 seconds LOL I think we will see a video in a couple of month &quot;Why I switched from my iPad to my mac&quot;, but seriously why get an iPad even if it have every app you need? the Mac will still run those apps better + the mac is cheaper, and the iPad isn&#39;t that smaller, it&#39;s 13 inch, the way I see it is that it&#39;s an overpriced touch screen MacBook air . I would still say the Tab S9+ and the Tab S9 Ultra with Samsung Dex capability is just way superior compared to the iPad with a very average user experience with iPad OS. The Galaxy tabs are also equally thinner and the Tab S9 ultra is an absolute beauty. The only &quot;tablet&quot; that makes sense is something that works as a full laptop but then you use the screen to more comfortably watch stuff or handwrite. Surface Pro style. The biggest issue of the iPad is iPad OS. It needs MacOS. iPadOS is crap. Wtf higher than vision pro ? Is it ? Oyyu Congrats and best wishes on the upcoming nuptials<br>Love your work for years<br>Thanks for all the hard work ipad kid. I strongly disagree on the app versus web thing 9/10 apps are just the website but outside a browser. So you have the &quot;benefit&quot; of not seeing the url bar. Hence webapp I really hope this isn&#39;t as bad as the iPhone 6... I hope Apple watched JerryRigEverything to fix every single one of their problems. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=477\">7:57</a> The second camera just pops out of no where, what is it? What if Apple just announced a MacBook with touchscreen and compatible with Pencil Pro...<br>Bye bye iPad 👋 at that price id rather get an apple vision pro People talking about how ipad could completely replace a laptop for years now, it have a &quot;laptop chip&quot; since 2021 with the M1, the issue is not how strong or capable the iPad itself is, but rather Apple that intensionally limits it in the software, and this won&#39;t change this year I already ordered it at the keynote...then cancelled it. I reconsidered the following: I will buy it if the iPad finally is &quot;getting loose&quot; as Apple promised. If I can fully replace my MacBook, I will buy the most expensive iPad and sell my MacBook Pro....but maybe Apple doesn&#39;t want me to do that. So it all depends on next month&#39;s WWDC... iPad 10 gen is the best due to its prices and performance, rather than these iPads they cost almost as much as a flipping pc 😅 Stick with the MacBook Pro, use the iPad by using something like Jump Desktop to connect remotely to the MacBook Pro where required. That solution works for me. For the love of God stop saying &quot;Apple made the best screen&quot; when it&#39;s a Samsung and LG panel. Apple does not make displays. These are Samsung&#39;s panels. People somehow still don&#39;t realize a lot of Apple components are made by Samsung, like their memory, their screens and several other components. Wow kinda early TIM COOK: Let&#39;s see you fix this new iPad of ours<br>LOUIE ROSSMAN: Repairing a malfunctioned Mac is one thing but a broken iPad is another issue. this new iPad gets me asking why apple insists on keeping a notch their laptops.

This is a revolution in personal computing Love how you can see it getting darker and darker though the video The millionth tech YouTuber saying he will replace his laptop, but never ends up doing it because the lack of a cooling fan in the iPad means it runs much slower than the macbook for prolonged work like video editing. It&#39;s not about the fan, which either MacBook Air has it. More about the software side, these &quot;pro apps&quot; they keep calling is the &quot;kiddie&quot; version of the actual pro apps they have on Windows/Mac It’s because it can do a lot but it’s still technically more inefficient and time consuming to do things on it since it’s limited by the iPad OS. People really want to be able to replace their computer with it because it’s everything in one but the software just makes it not an amazing experience The mac doesn&#39;t have a cooling fan WDYM? macbook air m1, m2 and m3 has no cooling fan After few months he and everyone else will make a video why the new apple iPad pro was not what they expected or titles like 3600$ waste bec not upto mark<br>It&#39;s the same cycle for all of them Macs dont have a cooling fan lol.. Apple Sillicon chips are based on mobile chips therefore they dont need extra cooling. That&#39;s the reason why you dont hear any kind of noise in a mac. I assure you my ipad pro m1 does not heat up nor does it lag on the apps it handles, even 100mb autodesk files where my s21 ultra chokes. Its not really about the ipad not having enough cooling but the ipados itself is the problem. The file system, the restrictiveness of ipados compared to the mac and the software support is laughable considering you have an M4 inside, even the M1 is still an overkill. \\u200b@@bintangg6506the airs dont have cooling fans, the pros do @@namrehtv2746they have better passive cooling though @@bintangg6506 MBPs have fans 70% of people could probably easily replace their laptops with tablets because most people are not really using high demanding software that has a lot of workload.

I&#39;m the favorite, $60,000 every week! Now I can afford anything and also support the work of God and the church. For me, it was always iPad .. right from the start.. I bought the OG iPad because watching movies on something so cool and portable was amazing .. compared to our bulky laptops back then. From there, it gradually increased to tasks like online shopping, reading, e-books, bit of gaming .. and now, I edit all my YouTube videos , thumbnails and short-form videos on it! For me, the most important gadget in my home, besides my iPhone is my iPad! So much so that if it breaks, I will run to the store and get one right away! Still feel a samsung tab would be better Apple devices are seriously well made and I can completely understand why people buy into them, but holy crap do they price their stuff ridiculously high. £3,500 is an obscene amount for something that will likely be made redundant quickly. Don&#39;t get too existed Arun!

We are still in the PC first world, nothing will beat actual PCs rn, well not in the form of a tablet anyway. Yea yea, there may be some people who will replace their laptop or PC with a tablet, but that will be a very small amount of people. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have an iPad too (the 12.9 m1 pro one), which I use as a media device, for example to watch movies in airplanes or when I&#39;m too lazy to get to my laptop, but it will never replace my laptop, which is my primary work (non apple software engineering) and gaming device.

Having an M1 iPad Pro 11&#39;  and a M2 MacBook Air 15&#39; myself, the ONLY difference I feel in performance is in the OS. All I want is a better way for file management and the freedom to download anything/everything (like you already can through any browser on Mac) and I would never buy a Mac or any other PC ever again. Every other service I personally needed a machine or gaming console for is already on some sort of cloud streaming service already.  I believe they&#39;re waiting for Mac sales to be utterly garbage (worse than to already is at least) before pulling the trigger to unleash iPad&#39;s full potential Will never consider getting Apple products (Android user and want to switch to any Android device), but still watch because I like tech and Mrwhostheboss. So I got the Note 20 phone, watch 6 and the Tab s9 and I am so happy with how they work together (especially the earbuds switching between the active device and that the tab and phone comes with a pen, plus multi tasking). Same. I have to admit that those new iPad Pros are rocking really cool hardware, but at their current (absurd) price they&#39;re simply out of the question. Not to mention that iPadOS is so locked down in terms of functionality that it would be like driving a Ferrari to go to work.

Even though a wedding isn&#39;t a paid event. Arent you married already ? no matter what, I still don&#39;t get the idea of using iPads with keyboards, if you&#39;re intended to use it like a laptop, then buy a mac? I bought iPad 3-4 years ago because of pencil. and this is how they can still going with ipads . If there wasn&#39;t apple pen ,there is nothing rest unique on ipad.

Bought my first 2020 changed to m1 and now definitely going to buy this new. Using external storage is easy nowadays also MS OneDrive integration is working fine no need iCloud. I forgot where my Windows laptop is.. Using the tablet for reading and watching + gaming is much easier and better. Also heaving logic keyboard and mouse which connects to the tablet using my HP docking station for having an external screen and more ports feels like a proper laptop. would get one, but you can&#39;t really code on the ipad as you cant access the terminal to my knowledge :/. I don&#39;t think an iPad is better to be used as a Mac. The use of the power on the iPad isn&#39;t gonna be maximized like it would on the Mac. Not to mention features and compatibility. For the things you use an ipad for you would be fine on an older ipad M1 or lower. You do nothing on there that requires any power tbh I doubt you&#39;re using iMovie to make your youtube videos Idk, man. I gave up laptop life in 2016 for a purely mobile experience between my iPhone and iPad.

I&#39;ve tried using this thing a ton of different ways but more often than not, I&#39;m just way more able to accomplish tasks efficiently on a Windows computer than I am an iPad... and I&#39;ve been using Apple products for most of my life.<br><br>Until they put iOS on an iPad, it&#39;ll just be a super expensive entertainment device. iOS is on the iPad I hate how everything is going to apps. Everything is becoming a download, requiring an account, being locked down and largely unmodifiable. Websites can be good, but everyone poured money into the apps instead of making sure their site worked better. Also generally sick of iPad being ALMOST great. But until they just allow me to use both iOS and MacOS on hardware that absolutely can let me do that, or until they include the full suite of phone benefits like the full range of cameras and sensors, it&#39;s useless to me. I don&#39;t want to buy three interconnected devices, I just want the one, and until that happens I don&#39;t feel the need to overspend on overhyped, locked down hardware stuck in its own little bubble away from my entire current PC and Android based ecosystem.

Your in a temu ad me watching this on my 9th gen ipad which I just bought previous month &#39;You just bought it!&#39;......because you have money to buy it. If you are out of money then a million reasons can&#39;t buy you one......😁 i just dont like how i cant use apple pencil 2, this is ridiculous jesus 3600 usd. Imagine thats your 1 year food budget. Well good luck on your bankruptcy apple. You can only use the brand new cases with these and they only cost £350! This stuff is why I hate Apple and try to never use their products. any reason for apple to be greedy All that power and still can’t choose what resolution your media should be. I&#39;m expecting an &quot;Underwhelmed&quot; or &quot;Disappointed&quot; update video after having used it for a while, and then switching back to your MacBook. I was an &quot;iPad as your computer&quot; guy all throughout my time in college. iPadOS just holds these devices back from their true potential. Which is probably on purpose, otherwise the iPad would cannibalize some MacBook sales. No rabbit r1 review its strange lol. iPad trap. You buy and find out you can’t do half of the things like on laptop. Millions went through it. Now your turn I guess I feel like crying out of jealousy because I have the iPad Pro 3rd gen and I rlly want this one for my school Between this and the s9 ultra, which is the thinnest? Is it worth upgrading to this new iPad from the iPad Pro M2? Probably not Unbox Therapie = &quot;heavy breathing&quot; Straight up violating that toothbrush. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Lmaoo My non-existent gf fr Facts, I was hoping someone else noticed Honestly until they put a more capable OS on it I’ll stick with my M1 Pro for Procreate I&#39;m quite excited to see how the new iPad handles like while being powered by the all new M4 chip while also being ridiculously thin. Also can&#39;t wait to see what type of AI stuff Apple has been cooking in the background. im waiting for apple cloth pro So Arun just said that the studio we grew in with is about to be switched :/ Can do more on android tabs. I&#39;ve had the M1 12 inch Pro iPad since new at launch, and a 2018 version before then.  The batteries barely last through 4 or 5 hours.  Even less with heavy pencil use.  Be interesting to see what the battery life is for this.  Arun, be wary of battery life.  But, I&#39;ve been able to use most battery banks to recharge. does Samsung have this typa tablet? Many ipad are used for professional use. But many are comparing it with features of an phone. ipad are regularly used for  animation, editing software and many other features that are similar to an laptop but it is more flexible and much easier to use unlike bulky laptops This video is kinda subjective.<br><br>You are reviewing this iPad as someone who has not used an iPad for years.<br><br>The magik keyboard, I bought it for the 12.9 inch pro, and i despise it. It has no hot bar and the quality sucks In what time did you please live, where tablets were ever better than the corresponding smartphone from the corresponding manufacturer? goodjob pushing 13inch ipads.. How does a sales guy sounds like … I mean a really really really good sales guy !!!? <br>Watch this Zack is gonna have a field day with this The English accent change is pretty mani-festing ❤😅 Is this vedio secretly sponsored by apple 😂 Nah, apple never sponsored anyone to my knowledge Me: Wow i can do all my tasks more efficiently-<br>My bank account:Are you sure about that but can it run freeform I kind of see your point...but I think its a fairly niche segment of people that say &quot;yes, I have a MacBook and am willing to toss that away and spend triple the money on an iPad replacement&quot;. Plus they have to buy all their apps again if didn&#39;t already have them on iPad. The future is not laptops I agree, but it&#39;s not iPad OS either.<br><br>I think Apple are going to struggle with this one. I just have this feeling it&#39;s a bad release that I don&#39;t think is going to sell as well as they&#39;re hoping (not that they would say it is below expectations :) ) Bro actually forgot what money is after becoming rich (no offence)🤣🤣 btw love your videos. iPad recall coming soon Bro about to make a £3k Mistake if he wants to use his iPad as a true MacBook replacement💀 I‘ve used my iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard for 2 Years now for my Uni Studies, the limitations of iPadOS become VERY clear VERY fast (especially with MS Office which is like 95% of my workflow) Please make a full video review when u get it , <br>It&#39;s been a while u did an interesting video 👍 Why the video is so dark? you blocked your pun with a card at the end of the video 🥲 You should do a tablet review of the latest Samsung with the latest iPad... it would be so good alot of money to distract kids I&#39;m just over here watching the progression from day to night. Lol 😂 How many of these 500+€ (the base one onwards) will break within the first year? 🤔😂 <br>It&#39;s so thin! I would never be able to carry it around with me without a cover 😅<br><br>But except this it&#39;s super impressive and I&#39;m intrigued to see how the Android universe will respond if they will... Because as of rn the only 2 really good tablets are from Apple or Samsung 😅 and it&#39;s almost a monopoly from the first one! With prices that are extremely too high It used to cost around 1.200 dollars for 2020 ipad pro with pencil and keyboard…<br>Now it costs around 3000 dollars for …this all… 😅 yeaaa… While it might be getting close to Macbooks in performance, the price is getting up there too if you include memory and the keyboard thingy. At the same time it doesn&#39;t actually have feature parity and while we do actually pay more for MBPs at work because the price is in our eyes worth it, I would hesitate to splurge what is pretty much a pretty good gaming PC on what at the end of the day is still a tablet. Cant wait until jerryrig everything get their hands on this The new wallpaper actually spells “pro” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=611\">10:11</a> Nice catch! Bro edits faster than me dad left me That ipad no shit cost more than my house dear all or some your complain, we have already in Samsung Tab S9 😅 Was that a Motorola Xoom???? Great video but if you swap your  laptop for an iPad I recommend you keep the remarkable tablet as the e ink screen is less harmful for eyes and sleep So like a Surface Pro then? Trouble is when you want to jot down notes/sketches while reading or working. You need two devices then, and then you are back to laptop+tablet. Apple doesn&#39;t want you to buy just an ipad<br>They want you to buy apple Note to self: All you do is watch YouTube, Rumble, or read a newspaper. DO NOT BUY!!! May of my classmates in university used an iPad with a keyboard+cover instead of a MacBook. The iPad did everything the MacBook did and paired with their iPhone seamlessly.<br>One problem I saw with their iPads was they weren&#39;t as durable as the MacBook. Many of their iPads screens were broken when they dropped them or had them in their school backpacks and got them crushed from books or pointy hard objects inside that cracked their screens uner pressure on the device inside.<br>Looking forward to seeing how you use it and share it with your audience on your platform. For that amount, i would go for the best laptop within that price. But honestly, until Tablets can have the EXACT or more power as a full flagship laptop, then tablets will always be obsolete.  But the form factor is better if tech can get there. you can buy a top end laptop or pc for that price That spec and performance seems unreal with stunning picture quality, actually looking forward to seeing you get your hands on it and doing a full review. It&#39;s either a sarcastic comment or a bad take. I’ll take your macbook if you don’t need it, please, thanks wait, is the apple pencil now more thicker than the IPad????? Just give the users the option to use IDEs on iPads like Xcode or vscode natively and you’ll see a lot of new users getting iPads instead of computers Damn Arun , it&#39;s your first time reviewing an ipad Apple are literally laughing all the way to the bank. People are so misguided now they&#39;re paying $3k for a flipping tablet. Very few people are. You can get an iPad for $349 FYI So we don&#39;t need to buy a MacBook. I can&#39;t wait for the launch of the new Macbooks and then hear what all the YouTubers have to say about them compared to iPads. 😂 Again, another Awesome vid from Mrwhosetheboss The content is always amazing always getting better and better, can&#39;t wait to see you overpass Apple in subcribers. bs Give me MacOS and i might consider buying it I&#39;m still using ipad mini 6. It&#39;s good enough.<br>N my s24 There&#39;s rarely a bad take here but when there is it kills lol I really need the new iPad it’s awesome but I can’t afford it 😂 Hey man I watch your videos a lot and I like them very much because of the pace colors and themes and something just disappeared in this video most of those things actually <br>I mean the music was nice in the dark background is pretty cool but it&#39;s not your style it feels scripted from Apple😅<br><br>But nothing too much just an insight form me to one of my favorite YouTuber <br>Good luck with designing your new place 👍 Apple devices and whatever chip they make are not worth it if u wanna game. Apple products only work great with apple made apps (which u dont get with the product and gotta buy it separately). These rigged up things by apple nowadays make me hate this company more and more. Those blacks are so deep 💀 I actually tried using the previous iPad Pro as a laptop replacement for 2 months at the end of last year and my conclusion is that it is not ready for that and probably never will be. Here’s my list of issues:<br>1) Stage manager is still fiddly and managing apps when you have a lot of them open is both quite restricted and a lot of effort (e.g. having more than one instance of the same app).<br>2) A lot of apps are simply not designed for using a mouse+keyboard meaning you have to lift your hands and touch the screen for sometimes basic actions (including in the OS itself).<br>3) using an external monitor is not very good because (i) it sometimes crashes and all open apps move to the iPad screen meaning you have to click the 3 dots on top and move them to external monitor; (ii) issues 1) and 2) get magnified; (iii) personally I hate how the OS manages workspaces/virtual desktops independently in each screen which means you have to click way more often than what I am used to on other OS.<br>4) you always depend on apps to do everything, which can get expensive but also makes working on it (as a programmer) not very good (due to lack of a basic console and other features of more open OS).<br>5) lack of ports… it has 1 USB-C, which means you NEED a dongle or a dock at all times if you need to plug in 2 things or more, or 1 thing + charge.<br>6) Pencil is good but if you want to use it intermittently for typing + drawing, then be prepared to fiddle around until the OS recognizes that you don’t want to use the pencil anymore. This is worse when not having a keyboard connected.<br>7) I wholeheartedly disagree with your assertion that programs are developed with apps as a focus. This might be true for entertainment but if you actually want to do work on iPad OS, you will find that these apps have countless limitations (lack of features) and annoyances and are generally much slower than their laptop/desktop counterpart.<br><br>Hopefully this stuff gets better with time but I realized that this is unlikely. Apple doesn’t want the iPad to be a competitor to the MacBooks and vice-versa; they don’t want the iPad to become the “MacBook with touch”. They want you to buy both and an iPhone. I think you will find that big phone + laptop is a much better and flexible combination that achieves 95% of what’s needed, making the iPad almost redundant. Any other combination of 2 of these products satisfies a lower % of what you need. The <b>only</b> exception being that if you need the Pencil to make money, then you should get the iPad. Otherwise, spare the 2k+. Mobile apps but bigger 😂😂<br>Also why send photos to iPad to edit if you already have a MacBook <br>Also an ipad for 3600 dollar is just overrated My girlfriend got me into apple from android as a pilot and a truck driver I find the apps better for flying and driving and it’s more secure than android Bro buys and makes a video about a new product before I even know that there&#39;s a new product. Love that Arun is branching out from just reviewing phones. From a ipad, mac, windows user. There are just some inconveniences using ipad as a laptop replacement. Mainly due to ipados. I tried. But it just doesnt. I bought a Dell 2 in 1 for 600 and put Linux mint on it. The UI is acceptable for touch and the writing apps are absolutely amazing. It has a many core amd and I just used to do my thesis in Matlab and Vivado this thin thing is a beast.<br><br>This was 3 years ago and still use it daily I think that Apple will need to make fundamental changes to how standoffish they are as a company to tempt the wider gaming market to offer its products on their platforms. 3k wtf I was thinking maybe I should move to apple I wanted to use a tablet but I spending that when I can get 2 gaming laptops FYI you can get a brand new iPad for $349 BUT CAN IT RUN WARZONE MOBILE😂 it probably can , its ios so well optimised I used to watch Arun because of his unbiased and honest reviews <br>This whole video feels like a paid promotion <br>He is over hyping the basic features So are you gonna switch to an iPhone since the iPad works better with an iPhone than an Android? can&#39;t wait for foldgate 2 pro max £3600 to play Warzone mobile is insane I feel still iPad Pro 2018 holds up pretty well and does the average daily stuff without any flaws. The chips do not actually make anything better unless you are editing videos or photos on iPads and at that point macs and MacBooks does it better. It cannot over come being a secondary device at any point of time because of iPad os limitations. the meat riding is crazy can&#39;t wait for jerry rig&#39;s video 😂 Bwat That thing is going to bend when JerryRigEverything breathes near it... Boss i dont know if wheter your editing had little time to put this video out because of the announcement, im pretty sure you guys could have gotten an NDA before it was announced for you to drop videos the same day, but i appreciate the less &quot;in your face brainrot&quot; editing, without letters coming out every time you mention a feature or something not that important, and the vfx also more toned down. you will always be the GOAT man Bro thought we wouldn&#39;t see what he was doing to that toothbrush Samsung tablets are so much better Apple is overrated. No tablet should cost over $4 grand. You can buy the best of the best pc tower/pc laptop for that including a 4090 and top newest intel/amd cpu ect. Good luck getting anywhere near that power with any crap apple product Almost everything you said about the magic keyboard was already available on the old one but nice vid! I&#39;m so upset that the new Apple Pencil Pro is only available for the new iPads. I assume that my iPad Pro M2 can handle the Apple pencil Pro. 3600$ ? Km good with my OnePlus pad What game is this at 1.04, I feel like I’ve played this a long time ago Apple innovation : make AIR bigger &amp; heavier. Make PRO thinner &amp; lighter. 😏 Ill suggest arun to watch mkbhd before buying one🤓 Well cause u can afford it lol it’s like getting to Apple vision price😂 Im a non apple guy Hi sir i really request if u could help me out by buying me an iPhone for a gaming purpose please i would pay u later after i win i am searching a sponsor so please help me sir i really really needed a phone for the tournament please sir I am not convinced to pay 300% extra profit margin to Tim for Samsung screen. There are Oled tablets available out there for £150 like Samsung S5e. Can you review Huawei Pura 70 ultra This seems like an ad, not a genuine review or reaction. I&#39;ve had several iPads, and a mini. The new iPad Pro is just the usual spec bump. iPads have their place; if you need one you need one, as I do for working on the run. But always, a laptop is better, and a Mac on my desk with a great screen is light years better than an iPad or laptop. Is this &quot;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&quot;? I can&#39;t believe anyone is honestly excited here. It&#39;s kind of like a new iPhone release; how exciting, really? ... when there is little ever anything new. Honestly the workflow described in the video has been there since the M1 Pros launched. Nothing new here. Yes the software has improved but there are still major drawbacks to using the iPad as a macbook replacement. Such as:<br>- Battery life<br>- Input lag in stage manager<br>- That weird round mouse &quot;pointer&quot; no precise clicking possible<br>- Bad files system<br>- No clamshell mode<br>- Low support outside of content apps<br>- Safari acting buggy as hell since iPad OS 17<br>- A single usb-c<br><br>......

But Apple is as much a luxury brand / lifestyle company as it is a tech giant, so I digress.<br><br>The truth is that for most casual consumers the PC era ended recently or is going to end soon. As a student I see more and more people using tablet folios or Surface products for note taking and simple browsing / video streaming. And other than workers in the tech / IT industry and PC gamers or enthusiasts, literally no one seems to be adopting laptops / desktops as the first choice over tablets, handhelds, and consoles. Rightfully so, because if you don&#39;t need the power you shouldn&#39;t spend the money for power but for other things that matter like portability, battery life, usability, e.t.c.<br><br>Nonetheless I am looking forward to Apple shills telling me they need this M4 chip for their intense 8 hour on the desk word / excel / YT / gaming workload when they could have easily bought an older equally viable ipad and hooked it up to an amazing display for home use for much cheaper. Or better yet just but two devices for two separate purposes (productivity and media consumption) for a cheaper combo price. For storage consider getting a NAS storage in place if you have a high end data connection. Quite modular and reliable without paying for a cloud subscription. Definitely benefits you over a period. If this comment gets 10,000 likes then I will tell my crush I like her Wait... so my real money is worth less than UK money? I remember when you could buy an iPad for 500$ no. I made it at the 59th minute!! For that price I could get a single CDJ 3000 by Pioneer and about a 100 songs from Beatport. iPads are good for two things: Drawing with ProCreate (see my avatar) and watching videos or movies. You can&#39;t burn USBs, program, or build and compile anything on an iPad. On a Mac, you can. Imagine writing dense Rust or C on an iPad. Me watching this on iphone 5 Battery life is not quite my expectation Really hoping that the M4 series doesn&#39;t run as hot as the M3. I ended up sending the MBP 16 M3 Max back due to fan noise. why not just add touch screen on laptops I used an iPad for a long time and I’d like to tell you from now that file management on iPad is absolutely awful bought it.then return in after shooting the video.profit Seems like he missed almost 10 years of ipads.  I mean 2018 ipad pro is still powerfull, and like then now still ipadOS is tablet OS, and unless they do something with v18 its not a laptop, no mater how powerfull it is. Plus the whole thing with size and new pencil connections so you have to buy new stuff is such apple move. Its fast enough, you can get docks and hubs but still Thinnest ever? I don&#39;t get why we accept the premise that thinner is better, OR the premise that the thickness of an object is not determined by the thicket point, which is the camera bump which does not need to exist. If the whole of our phones and tablets were thicker we wouldn&#39;t need cases to make the back flat so it rests properly on a flat surface, would have better antenna, SD card readers, internal stylus, better cooling solutions and bigger batteries and they&#39;d <b>still</b> be incredibly thin. <br><br>Just mock the obsession with thinness and with &#39;new&#39; versions of blue and green every year.

Arun the type of guy all the &quot;drake the type of guy&quot; suits him With that money, I could feed my cats, for the rest of their lives.<br><br>🙄🙄🙄 It’s funny to me how similar my thought process was before i purchased my m2 ipad pro. I obsessed for a while before making the purchase into finding out the pro’s and cons of the device. What software it supported and how well it worked and even if i could use a third party mechanical keyboard or mouse on it without too much hassle. I had a samsung tab s7 before but it was simply too slow and unresponsive for what i wanted to do, not to mention the s-pen would stop at random during the drawing of lines. But as soon as i tried and eventually purchased the ipad it became my main creative device. Presenting iScam Air and iScam Pro I just instead of I&#39;ve just...your producer must be from north America (most likely from the USA) 😬 don&#39;t americanise your English mate @arun what game are you playing in this video i would never give my kid this expensive tablet just for him to watch skibidi toilet Actually what you’re saying here is NOT the reason to get the M4 but more of a reason for you to get an iPad Pro. You can do the same thing with a M1 or M2 iPad. To upgrade from the previous gen… meh.. gimmicky to be honest. I want to aim $500 budget laptop and this tablet is almost 8x more expensive than my dream😂😂 Wow thats insane also I love your videos the pace of them is perfect I bought my iPad last year and I basically use it as an overpriced notebook. It literally cannot do what a laptop does in terms of work or a phone in terms of efficiency regardless of how it’s marketed. Honestly I don&#39;t normally like Apple, I&#39;m a Google guy but seriously I&#39;m impressed 👍 Amoled finally 😂. I just bought a galaxy book 2 360. I sold my tablet a while ago .. but now I&#39;ll be studying medicine. And I need something like this in my opinion... So basically you get a lot of high-end hardware that the software does not make use of. In short,  unless you have some very specific use cases, you will see no difference from the M1 Ipad Pro.  Apple will never open IpadOS to really take advantage of the hardware, as that would eat into their Macbook Air sales :))) Now some android person will come and start trash talking about apple coz why not 😂. Then some apple user come and talk shit about Android. Lets do it this product is good for those who use FCP to edit their videos but am someone who edit video on Premiere Pro sooo... still stuck with Macbook Annnnaaaaaa.........

Ayye! @@ananthankrishnan1834 ayye 😂😂😂me looking at things that I can&#39;t afford cause am a poor student iPad OS lets down the hardware, try to download an attachment for an email, then attach to another email and you’ll want to throw it out the window.<br>No amount of thinness or speed will make up for IPad OS lacking compared to MacOS. This is really cool but it&#39;s an Apple product so unfortunately it&#39;s useless. In terms of gaming on MacOS, i think it&#39;ll help if more games are ported from iOS and iPadOS to the Mac. For example, codm on a mac. I think that&#39;ll give more Mac users a lot of options when it comes to gaming. That Motorola Xoom was great was thinking if make it so thin if goes wrong Apple will be the only place to fix it as in re your video about broken phones theres no point if you cant run macos apps on it Mark my words, you will not give up your laptop. The ipad pro plus keyboard does not replace Macbook Pro Next iPad probably at 2090 Apple 😢😢$3600😢😢so bad lowkey, u can buy tablet, phone, desktop and laptop, for price of tablet and keyboard xd 4000 $ wtf Not seeing lot of comment about the wedding , Congratulations bruv <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=934\">15:34</a> Thanks for calling me cute If Samsung starts using x elite in their tablet it will be more appealing because of dex Answer: For Content. If only iPad can run PS2 or PS3 Emulator, that M4 chip would be a good use and not such a waste considering how powerful that is compared to the current Snap 8 gen 2 on the galaxy Tab S9 ultra. You broke down the pros and cons perfectly! Bro, i just bought the new ipad, but it doesnt look like that, they said it was Iped prO? Most powerful device for mobile game <br>Without emulator detection I remember wanting an iPad when I was younger and thinking $300 was a lot. This is just ridiculous... while the ipad pro is very tempting even for me i gave up on it for multiple reasons, first one is it doesnt fix my issue, i need to have one device with sim active at all times also connected to wifi/celular , meaning ipad will not fix my issue forcing me to buy a second iphone pro max, when all your data is on device it is a priority to have access to it at any time, as for me it has 2 light pros rest are cons, one being extension for iphone and extension for mac yes it is usefull but for that price why should i add an extra device i need to babysit,, and finally is oled and 120hz pro motion this is without a doubt best display but sadly even if i game on iphone i do it for less than a hour daily, as for cons as i meantioned before, it is not an individual device like mac or iphone it forces you to have one or the orther to work, second is you cant use iphone sim to make calls, lastly if you want to do that or have celular you need pay extra for it, another con for me it is hard to carry and find a use to get value out of the 2000$ it costs without accesories, even with i cant find a good use for. I didn’t think I needed a Pro iPad, but I got the one with the M1 chip and never wanted to use my MacBook again. Now, it is just a paperweight. But the iPad is my primary device It’s interesting how as Arun is going from Mac to iPad, I’m trying to go from iPad to Mac, offloading as many things as I do on an iPad on to my MacBook and iPhone I see how some of the comments are copied from the mkbhd video on iPad... I just care about ipad mini I like the ipad for the fact you can do artwork on them. Tablets being able to replace a laptop finally is nice. Lmao, the time has not come yet.....<br><br>You&#39;ll see him working on his laptop in next video and even after 5 to 10 years Huawei 70 Pura review please You didn&#39;t buy it because you needed it, you bought it because it&#39;s thin.<br><br>I honestly don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse; Apple or Apple customers. Just buy a Microsoft Surface? Now you really need a smart Toyota Car! Jerry is going to have a field day with this one Android users rn 👀😂 I can bet my right ass cheek that he isn’t gonna replace his laptop with the iPad I need a tablet for music sheets mostly but i aint giving them 3k for it i will just probably find an ancient one that works good enough and buy it for 50 bucks I don&#39;t understand the pricing for this product. My tablet is $200 (Lenovo), and the keyboard was $50 off ebay. I&#39;m pretty sure it will do 98% of what this tablet does, and I know it does 100% of what I want it to do. So, is the extra 2% this thing can do really worth $2500 (or whatever it is). Will this thing really be attractive to people other than a) uber rich (status chasers?) , b) fanboys or c) artists/content creators? I can&#39;t imagine them selling many of these things. I&#39;m probably really missing something....and I&#39;m not trying to be an anti-apple jerk here; some of the new tech is interesting.There must be value I just can&#39;t appreciate. I hope. I get I&#39;m &quot;not the market for this&quot;....but...who the hell is? I could never justify spending that much on a tablet unless they put Mac OS on it because iPad OS is so extremely limited on what you can and cannot do with them. I still don&#39;t understand why Apple doesn&#39;t just ship them with Mac OS. Like if your watching on ipad mr who isn’t comfortable <br>with the new apple ipad You need 8 terabytes? <br>What are you doing with your laptop? The contrast between this and MKBHD&#39;s video is awesome. I love hearing the different opinions and view points.

I made a claim that Apple never has one the same products that conflict with eachother. They directly do now<br>   8GB of RAM is basically the capacity you’re gonna get on the iPad so far with M4. The problem is that an iPhone 15 has 6GB. Performance can be matched w/an iPhone<br>  Only Touchscreen would be Productively Advantageous. Similarly priced MacBooks have integrated keyboards&amp;Spatial Speakers (iPad doesn’t), along with a 3.5mm Audio port.<br>   At this point, the iPad fills a tiny Niche of Graphic Designers. Where Enhanced Touchscreens might be useful personally I hate when programs tell me to install another app that I will most likely only use that one time instead of directing me to a website, that I can open in any browser, bookmark it, or send it to another device easily Rip ipad bendy iPhone 6 p For file saving I recommend using the one drive app on iPad it feels like a computer file save but works very well. You can use it to make folders and save files easily Within one hour gang Unfortunately tablets are quite bad when you try to use them in awkward positions on a couch or in bed i feel. Also multitasking will never be as easy as on a laptop unless they open it up with a proper file manager I wish the iPad OS with its &quot;laptop capable processor&quot; depart from the iOS to MacOS or maybe bridge between it. For file saving I recommend using the one drive app on iPad it feels like a computer file save but works very well. You can use it to make folders and save files easily This video is just about Arun finding ways so hard to convince himself to buy a giant iPhone Tries to make a case for IPad… iOS is still the operating system and that is just aweful on file management and interoperability. Feels like working through a thick layer of forced “simplicity” getting constantly in my way. Sooooooooooo y&#39;all want touch screens that bad?<br>Come on. Admit it. wdym &quot;why i just bought it&quot;, dawg you bought it so you could make a youtube video on it What about professional students?

As an M2 iPad user, I can confirm that I&#39;m gutted the Apple Pencil Pro and the new keyboard is not compatible. iPad Filthy casuals? Ahh it runs ios, which means every ipad in the world can do whatever the new one does and please don&#39;t mention replacing your laptop, you can&#39;t. An iPad can replace a MacBook but it ain’t replacing a PC ☠️ 😢I used to think Mr. WhoseTheBoss was quite bright.<br><br>Now, I realize he&#39;s a silly fool as circumspect and discerning in his fidelity to reality and humanity as a capricious child let loose in a candy store with no rhyme nor reason, adult in the room, guiding him - with no care in the world being given to what candy he feeds his sugar addiction upon by ingesting. Apple doesn&#39;t want people to only buy their iPad but also MacBook because of ipad os, but if other companies come up with an xElite processor and Windows on their tablet, then Apple should consider adding macOS to their iPad. That way, consumers would benefit from having full desktop experience on their tablet.

Later that day you get a call from work saying there have been a virus gotten into a PC, then you go back into the apple store and buy 10 of the latest iMacs and also remembers that you hate getting out of bed to switch of the lights, so then you decide to also get yourself 3 Homepods and 2 Homepod minis and decides to get a another MacBook and an iMac for yourself aswell. Then you see the apple vision pro so you decide to play around with it for a while and then your fingers decides to press the buy button, then before you leave you decide to get accessories,  cases, charging wires, charging blocks and an Apple TV 4K. Then you get a call from the bank saying that you are broke!🤑 okey finally first real pro device from apple. Please do an S9 Ultra video as well.😊 Hey arun what&#39;s your favourite toothbrush want pearly teeth like yours 😊 The problem is, that the Performance and thickness was never the thing that was holding back the ipad. Even the ipad air is able to perform all daily tasks. The main reason are the limitations of ipad os instead of mac os and that all apps run on a mobile speced down versions. Long story short, this ipad wont do more than the older ipads, its just a more expensive and premium way. new ipad air is still 60hz , it&#39;s a shame<br>apple force people to buy pro versions<br>I prefer Samsung tab S9 series , even S9 FE are 90hz , pen included, and samsung ecosystem is great Whàt an expensive Screen to watch Netflix on 😢 No way they made it thinner 😅 now it can bend even easier 🥵 I think it should be thicker, chunkier and stuffed full of battery because it will be shoved in a tough case anyway and it it was thicker MIDI ports could fit!

It really depends on what you need. If you still need to work with computer productive softwares like Autodesk Fusion, Rhino (lag AF on Macbooks), Kicad, not sure about VScode etc, iOS still doesn&#39;t have those and we still have no choice.

And it&#39;s a apple product 😅🤡🤣 Waiting for Jerryring&#39;s durability test The fact they made all of this without lettijng you run professional desktop applications on it is just staggering to me. Like it doesn&#39;t even make sense from Apple&#39;s perspective as this thing is macbook pro priced. I mean, it has a laptop chip in it... let it run those applications.<br>Now this tablet is just doomed to be extremely super niche. Basically just for artists who are not advanced enough to already have their professional kit, but also have the money to drop several thousand bucks on a tablet.<br>Ultimately this thing is just another rich Apple consumer&#39;s dream toy that sort of sits in an awkward spot between phone and laptop, sort of filling a specific niche but not being the best of any category. Why are we talking about gaming in this review as if its a positive thing. Mobile gaming is absolutely awful rn (which you even stated yourself in the past) and it not running laptop/desktop games is a huge downside (even with Apple&#39;s limited supported library).<br>Apps in general are not really a replacement for computer applications when you&#39;re talking about these levels of performance. They&#39;re always going to tailor to, and take advantage of weaker chipsets found in phones.

Codm players getting ready to buy😂 Thinnest iPad is cool...what can it do? I’m going to be honest, I feel the exact opposite way. The iPad is what I currently have and I am trying to get a MacBook. Yes iPad does allow you to download things and is quite portable, whilst having all the other benefits of being an iPad. BUT. There are many issues with them. For one, battery life. If you’re ever even doing anything remotely intense you get about 4 or under hours of battery life. That is not enough to consider portable. You also are not only going to need a MacBook to run Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, there’s also a subscription fee on top of that to be able to use it vs on MacBook it’s a one time purchase. It also is quite a bit less powerful, which you mentioned, but honestly living with one you can sometimes feel it. Obviously it does insanely well for an iPad but it just isn’t really enough if you’re doing much editing or anything graphic intensive. Plus, it’s extremely easy to break and crack which I can only imagine is much more of an issue on the new one. MacBooks are also probably quite easy to break but atleast they have a cover on so you get some protection where there is none on an iPad. And, on top of that while yes it does run games it is like any other apple product. Not really the best. I do have to admit I am very lucky to have one and it is really fun and useful but it just isn’t really enough and I can imagine you would use it for much more graphic intensive things than I would. Obviously do whatever you believe is best for you, that’s just my opinion. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. I just started to be in Apple environment and now this thing came out. By the way, good and useful information you’ve provided! Might consider this as an option😄 break it I’m debating between the 11” and the 13” model.

I already have a Mac and this is not meant to replace that. It’s meant to work TOGETHER with the Apple ecosystem and be the best media device which you can occasionally use for work as well. Yes, it’s a luxury device and way too expensive, but it’s just so much fun to use and worth it for me. For what . What is this new m4 pro proforma on the iPad that can&#39;t be done better anywhere else, or same on last gen? Worth nothing \\u200b@@MrDragonorpbro it not some revolutionary step. It does everything the old can do but faster and uses less power. Also the m4 is future proof. It&#39;s not a mini pc @@_Meme_lord_1agreed, if you don’t like it, just don’t buy it. i can see this being a big step up for artists since the oled screen will give you accurate colors when drawing and the new apple pencil will be nice as well. just because it doesn’t fit YOUR needs doesn’t mean you have to talk it down. @@devilofgenisis cry Yeah bro, you are not gonna switch to this full-time any time soon. OS is the biggest drawback. Bro I’m watching this on an Ipad Really wish Apple would enable a MacOS option for iPad Pro.  My M2 iPad is already more power than I can use while limited to iPadOS and it’s always a little frustrating. <br><br>There’s got to be a market out there for a touchscreen enabled MacBook that works with Apple Pencil - this would easily be filled with a MacOS enabled iPad plus Magic Keyboard.  Maybe that’s why it hasn’t happened because it would cannibalise MacBook sales. When the AI apocalypse hits, smart homes will be the first to fall.  LOL I have never wanted a tablet again this bad. Of course I will still hold my MacBook close to my heart, not to mention it houses all of my folders and Google Documents and I use Studio One 6 on it. But if I want/need a similar form factor, but don&#39;t require the bulkiness and hardware required for more demanding work, and just want something for light work and mostly social media and whatnot, this and the magic keyboard are right up my alley.<br><br><i>I&#39;ll just wait a few years until they&#39;re being sold for cheaper.</i> But seriously, I dig this. Amazing work as always, Arun I&#39;ve seen people review it too! 𝙃𝙞 You’ll be surprised how limited the iPad actually is because of iPadOS. I love ipads , can&#39;t wait to buy this one , ill exchange my older one for this if they let me As a guy who use the latest Samsung tablet (tab S9) i think a causal user (which most of us are) we Don&#39;t need the latest and greatest.i think if you are going for apple you can still get the 90 % experience with the air or the M 1 and M 2 for  the half of the prize or less, i used to think Ipad was the way but i bought a samsung tablet because it gives me a wayy better screen than the ipad for almost half the price and also i Don&#39;t need the Macbook level of power because i would be watching content and playing casal games anyway.also Ipad air probably has a 60hz screen which is a big no no and ite dosent even come with the pencil. A sub to the channel would be.. reMACable😉 Watching this on my Xiaomi pad 5. Yes, weight is a major factor. But I get almost the same experience at a fraction of the iPad cost. Hamaaanm] It needs UTM at least and because of the EU, that should be coming soon DONT buy new ipads,<br>go for android if you want amoled display and go for ipad air m1 if you want an ipad.<br>dont complicate things, its as simple and straightforward as it can ever get. So Tablets are stupid expensive now i can just imagine when going into an apple store to purchase this, you will go up to the desk, and they will promptly ask you for your bank-account number.

You are a youtuber, you want views that&#39;s why you bought it ‼️<br><br>As simple as that! If I were to buy a smartphone or tablet now, I would probably buy a tablet 😂 First i guss 1. Bigger screen. Unless ipad finally release a bigger version like Samsung ultra tab it can not replace anything.<br>2. Limits in ipad os/ipad is still there, file management, storage, ports etc etc.<br>3. Some apps are still way worse compared to desktop apps. For example Photoshop which I use daily lacking so many features it makes it fairly useless.<br><br>Will not buy a new ipad pro unless all 3 above is seen, if they happen, maybe i will replace my macbook pro 16. Best all round video so far. Not sure myself and the pricing these days for pro stuff from Apple is just crazy Android:  just bcz expensive doesent mean its better🍷. We have nokia which is the real deal and we have the biggest tablet samsung.

I had recently shifted from my laptop (macbook air i5) to ipad air 5th gen (m1). I added the magic keyboard and 2nd gen apple pencil along with it.
