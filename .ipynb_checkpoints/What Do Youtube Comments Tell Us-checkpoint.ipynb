    "We studied how to extract information from textual materials in class. I wonder if we can do the same with videos. I'm interested to see if we can apply the tools we learned in class to uncover hidden insights from YouTube videos and comments. I believe that the emotions expressed in people’s comments strongly correlate with the likelihood of purchasing a product and can predict market trends. For this project, I am going to compare script and comments from the top five most viewed Youtube videos reviews on the newly released iPad pro with M4 chip. \n",

       "'3.9 million views. We paid for this video by views alone. Imma hop on CODM with this MF 😂😂😂 Dude ipad software is even worse than macbook and even more limited Wait how much does this cost? that toothbrush scene was fascinating 😂 Wtf 3600$. I&#39;d rather upgrade my pc and the rest money, i&#39;ll buy an android What writing Tablet is the one u used? Really interesting take...I don&#39;t use my phone for anything if I can help it.  I even use my laptop to send texts because the tiny keyboard is useless to me.  When websites try to send me to apps, I get really annoyed.  And of course, this is Apple...I won&#39;t use apple products if I can help it.  Unless you are doing video editing or graphic design, they are pretty useless. In my country there is 2200$ if you convert this into Kuwaiti dinar i swear😮😮 Wow Apple fans are a really really strange group of people... Why I have a 2 in 1 pc. Gets me all the advantages of a tablet, as a PC. The reality is I do a lot of coding and running various virtual machines, and all the applications I use work perfectly on PC. Are we just going to ignore the toothbrush at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Ok everything is fine but what brand or mpdel is ypur sweatshirt 😂 How do i get that Pokemon starter apple watch face? As someone who understands the technology,  I would obviously never buy an Apple product. But, as someone who understands profits over people, I&#39;ve bought a decent amount of Apple stock. So, I think apple is great and everyone should buy one. *2600 dollars My names Kade, a great videographer and photographer, here to tell you this will take up space in my inventory as a creator because I have a PC and MSI gaming laptop. I was here for the screen colors and debating if I wanted a iPhone color profile screen to edit photos on😂 not worth it to me. Okay how did I not know that writing tablets are a thing?????? I honestly prefer going to a website on my mobile devices compared to an app because storage management is something I really struggle with and websites barely take up any storage compared to the app. So did you take it on the aisle😂 3.47 If apple comes out with a foldable the size of the z fold = Game over. You spent 3600 bucks because you can afford it. We can’t. Prices are becoming obscene. But as long as there are people willing and able to pay them, there’s clearly a market for these super inflated prices. My ipad 2018 is stuck in boot loop. 😢😢😢😢😢<br>The price of ipad has sky rocketed. Arjun is becoming an I pad kid Bro literally convinced himself to buy the iPad For the large iPad Pro’s, Apple should be ashamed for not including a 30W charger. That was one of my very first purchases along with a 6 ft white extension cord Apple used to make for the Mac’s. The 6 foot white extension cord into the 30W Mac charging brick out to a 3 ft Amazon Basics braided USB-C cord is a must for conveniently staying charged while on the couch and a must accessory for traveling. I have an iPad Pro 12.9 5th Generation with 1 TB. I don’t see anything compelling enough to make a change. I have the keyboard case so the weight difference would be insignificant and the screen display would only be marginally better and I would be concerned about burn in. Imagine if the burn in was slightly different on the two layers. That would be a real mess. Where can I download those $3600 to me living in Indonesia doesn&#39;t sound all that expensive if an average wage earner earns just as low as $2000 in USA.<br><br>Here the price of a new iPhone could be 4-5x the low average wage worker here... Bro&#39;s video quality even on 360p on my phone🫡🫡❤ There is a sucker born every minute. That&#39;s apple for ya a rip off It could bend like paper and it’s battery could be 🐶💩 in comparison I think should have just packed it with a m3 like it may be that powerful but all you can do with that much power is play triple aaa games that only support m1 but there’s less than 10 games that actually require a m1 The iPad only 1568 I once had a hauwei smart phone and it was bent almost like a half circle and it still worked didn&#39;t lagg nothing In my country if i max out the ipad pro m4 it will cost 3.9k and that with tax included. That cost more then building a mid-range desktop and buying macbook pro or the air. Like wtf apple? This is not gonna replace macbooks my ass lol Your rich and they paid you ..sorry they suck and you know it Apple is the evil 😈 you have to pay so money subscription ! Who watches this guy?! Pass <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=345\">5:45</a> That whole segment was funny to me especially the “wow” 😂 Don’t get me wrong. This is a truly great device  and nothing like it.  I respectfully have to disagree with this video and amount spent on something like this. Good luck trying to make it work. This so called “work around” you are trying to pursue unless they change the concept of iPad OS will be a awful miserable  attempt coming from my experience of 2 years trying to make the iPad Pro 12.9 which I was glad to get rid of and change for a MacBook Air this year  at least for my use case as daily computer and logic. humans are intuitive we feel comfortable touching the screen ,using tablet keyboard,especially chilling out , harder to relax using a mac ,too clunky, can imaging people buying this to connect to their top spec imac and use with touch. people like to flex their cash on these products,unless you do loads of video editing or word processing,need loads of storage and like to do many things while waiting on videos processing it’s a hell of a lot of cash ,plush you’ll need pencil pro ,new keypad/case , if you need it for work and can use it for leisure fair enough if you need to upgrade, never worked out how dollar price equals pound price Product price $3,600<br>What customers get<br>USB 2.0 480 Mbps<br>Battery 10,290 mAh<br>20W USB-C adapter actually receives 35W.<br>$3,600!!!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 With 18.8M subs he either git the ipad for free or hes banking.  I only imagine the car he drives. Why you started mimic of Marques brownlee? I spent less money on my gaming beast PC than this tiny little screen would cost. What a scam. With the newest advancements in chipsets and tech, I want a 17&quot; tablet that is faster and more powerful than my current 2022 Dell XPS 9710. I also want a laptop style keyboard dock, which has a built-in extra battery supply for the tablet to add use time. The tablet would need to have a couple Thunderbolt 4 ports so I can connect a USB hub and drives, an extra monitor, and supply power. Oh, and I definitely want it to be not an Apple. I feel like you converted the nearly £2900 of your specced iPad to dollars just to make the video sound extra &quot;clickable&quot;, like &quot;$3000&quot; didn&#39;t sound catchy enough, so you had to stretch it to $3600.<br><br>The iPad Pro 11 inch and 13 inch costs £999 / £1299 respectively in the UK. In the US, they cost $999 / $1299.<br><br>Your £2877 iPad Pro costs $2877 in the US. I understand that you want the currency in the title to be widely understood, but adding an over $600 markup doesn&#39;t make sense here.<br><br>And yes, you could say &quot;I&#39;m only converting it to dollars to the viewers have an accurate idea as to how much I ACTUALLY paid in my currency when converted&quot;, but that logic also wouldn&#39;t make sense here. If I were to buy an iPad Pro in Denmark with the same configuration that you selected, I&#39;d be paying 29297 Danish Kroner. When converted to dollars, I get $4271. Buying a max spec iPad Pro in Denmark costs an additional $1394 when compared to the US.<br><br>So in some other Universe, a Danish MrWhoseTheBoss could title their video &quot;Why I spent $4271 on the iPad Pro M4.&quot; And while they wouldn&#39;t be wrong when talking about how much they paid in their currency when converted to dollars, Denmark has less than 0.02% the population the US does, so talking about the iPad Pro&#39;s cost in Danish Kroner doesn&#39;t make sense to your viewers who would be paying $1400 LESS for the EXACT same machine.<br><br>Even the UK only has 20% the population the US does, so it really isn&#39;t fair to talk about the cost of the iPad using British Pounds, as if you convert the currency you end up tacking an extra $600 onto the cost out of nowhere. I feel that next time, if you want to use dollars in your title to describe the cost of something you bought to your main audience (US viewers), you should get the figure based on how much the item costs in the US instead of how much you actually paid, and then converting.<br><br>It&#39;s more work, but it&#39;s more honest, and I feel like that&#39;s more important than making the video sound extra clickable. Can you do a video on iPad Air It’s just like a Vision Pro for your hands, hahaha Good evening are you doing anything with the Xiaomi Mix Fold 4? good advertisment for ipad I think this a solid buy if you don’t already have a laptop or computer. This is solid for maybe like a designer or artist of some sort but for daily use it seems way more cumbersome (ironic bc it’s so thin) but I’d rather use the laptop where it feels all together where this device is like holding the worst part of a MacBook. Like I dunno iPads are cool for legit drawing and watching stuff. 3600 is like a 2010 Prius lol Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. No one get to the Father except through him. DO A GIVE AWAWY IF YIU WANNA BEAT THE APPLE Tbf its got less ports which i think is important. 1. i dont like trackpads, 2. I do actully use the HDMI and Ethernet ports. I also find that for most people who are gamees they are probably not gaming on a Mac, a PC or Linux machine would do you better since more stuff is designed to work on those, it even feels like steam cares more about Linux than Mac at this point Perfect use of ‘filthy casual’ as long as people like you keeps buying it with that price, they won&#39;t integrate MacOS and iPadOS, never. Most overrated tech youtuber who doesn&#39;t know bs about tech Because you have $3600 to spend on it That pencil is in the perfect place to be stolen and it is expensive so that makes it even more appealing. And the iPad could probably just slip out of your hand and fall or get taken by a thief. And just 3 weeks later, he wants Them to fix it I thought @Mrwhosetheboss was in the UK??

My old iPad runs longer than the new one so bring a battery as far as the blacks in the detail of the screens I bought the top of the line, sony OLED and it’s better than my $5000 TV so now I find myself watching movies in my iPad and tv off in the background and the iPad in my lap&gt; I don&#39;t like your review at all because it&#39;s not fun to talk too much Apple is a 🤡 can you post a link where you got the writing tablet from please?

Next video: “Why I returned my $3600 iPad” Would love to hear your view on the upcoming Windows Surface Pro 11. I&#39;m sure iPad will give the more refined tablet experience, at least for a recreational user, but as you&#39;ve said in this video the use case for most users seems better suited to the Surface. I spent $1800 on one it will be here wednesday. I use an iPad Mini5 for hybrid use (work/pleasure) I work over the road a lot and 99% of the time instead of getting my work laptop out I just grab my iPad Mini to write a quote or check on a job or what ever. I justified my purchase because of this. I use my phone for a hotspot and having my iPad instantly connect when I pull it out of my bag is a huge plus. My windows laptop is a pain in the ass most of the time to get to connect to my phone for internet. 3600 is not a lot for an iPad and plus that&#39;s small amount In general Sarcastic? can you do a review on the tab s9 Ultra <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=332\">5:32</a> I love how, when discussing doing work on a device, literally all youtubers talk about video and photo editing, as if that is what we all work on. 😂 That’s because they’re making the video recapping their experiences and not ours so video and photo editing would be part of doing their work Imagine using one the finest brains in the field of engineering just to trim down the size of a product by a few mm 😑😑 A feature which no one gives a damn after a point. Basically millions of dollars spent so that people can save probably 3-4mm space in their backpack. Giving a M4 chipset in a machine which lacks the software capability to utilize it. <br>These things are what is exactly wrong with Apple and the cause of their doom. They are spending resources in places where it is not required. All this gimmick is what causes the price of an Apple product to rise which in itself makes it irrational for many people. video started in the afternoon and ended at night Even as a millionaire, I would never waste $3,600 on a tablet :/ Retakes took till night 😂 MKBHD was a lot more objective about this. The lack of MacOS on a device that casts more than $3000 is criminal. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=144\">2:24</a> device name? remarkable notepad I&#39;m curious how a VM would run on this. An M4 in this with a tiny bit slower load times for heavy work makes me thing that it&#39;s power is being limited, either due to a technical limitation or to maintain the device being cool. Do they want that? probably not, but the option is available to you. Watching this on my 2013 ipad 💪🏻 I don’t know what are your real motives behind this video, but iPad Pro is still faaaar to be a real mac replacement. Tried the switch myself lately and bumped into many issues… poor file management, mouse/trackpad right click options are poor, horrendous bezels on the Youtube videos that eat half the screen, etc etc. Had to rush back to my mac.<br>Truth is Apple will never make the ipad a mac replacement, cause they want you buy both. Sure lemme just scribble what i want my second mansion to look like lol rich people Man really made a vid to convince and justify himself into buying it 💀💀💀 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=68\">1:08</a> because you can’t do art on it a great video, but I really want to know what song is in the BG at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=760\">12:40</a> onwards. Apple pencil needs to make a version for iPhone to rival Samsung&#39;s S -Pen $3500? How soon do you have to replace it? Even 5 years is bad. You where my inspiration to make my youtube channel, thank you. the samsung intro was cooler Files works really well on an iPad, if you want to move files around within your device and to any other compatible device. The biggest real annoyance for me is the inability to move files to and from every other app on the device. Many apps are sandboxed. For instance, my third party alarm clock only plays clips from Music, and cannot even see anything from VLC. The other annoyance is the inability to just add media files to Music from other apps without having to connect to a Mac or other &#39;master&#39; computer, add the music to the computer&#39;s version of Music, and then &#39;sync&#39; the iPad to it. It&#39;s very inconvenient and clunky, whilst requiring you to have either another computer for the job, or to buy media from Apple&#39;s online store. Binge watching Mrwhosetheboss😂❤ Modern smartphone screens are too big. They don&#39;t fit into pockets easily, are difficult for someone with smaller hands to hold easily, and are often too large for some wireless chargers. If I want a good sized screen size in a lightweight device with a decent on-screen keyboard, and excellent battery life, I buy a tablet. Like the one I&#39;m using now. If I want complete portable computer functionality, I buy a laptop. My MBP battery also lasts all day. I have the iPad Pro from 2019. It still operates like it&#39;s brand new. I have no reason to upgrade. Great you can afford it the rest of us are surviving on a day to day basis. The priority is to have a roof over your head and to have food on the table. The rest such as apple us just bullshit Shilly review I need your review for tab s9 ultra 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 you can make an iPad if your phone sells well😀 Just ordered the new iPad Pro m4. I don’t need one as I already have an iPad 10th gen but WTH, why not lol Which is when you convert from Dollar$(3600) to Rupees₹(299, 016) which is I mean that is just an obscene amount to pay for a tablet. <br><br>While i pay ₹27,000 for a phone and thought it was ridiculous expensive.<br>Broke me(literally dying inside) Anyone who uses &quot;smart&quot; everything is not a bright cookie. Anyone else watching this on an iPad? Just buy last gen 😩 that toothbrush scene always irritates me 😂 Is this cool? Yeah. But most people buying this probably wouldn’t notice if it were switched out with an ipad air. Such a poor decision, but then again $3.6k is chump change for him. You have wasted your money. Please come back with a video comparing the base model to the spec that you have purchased. hey man hey man Mrwhosetheboss: Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.<br>Everyone: For Content farming 😅😅 what am I doing here, i dont even have an iphone. never used any ios device. iPad OS can’t do what Mac OS does. My CRM system has versions for both. I can only do document and e-mail merges on  Mac OS. There is nothing better than walking around your house with your iPhone on a MagSafe charger and using the larger screen and desktop-like robustness of an iPad. I know you’re saying the tablet is actually not a more robust experience (and maybe that’s true of Android tablets) but I suspect you’re just being unfair. Hey Mrwhosetheboss I&#39;m George from Namibia (in Africa) I wanted to ask if you would please send me an iphone so I start my own YouTube channel 🙏. Can i have your macbook? will this work with 10th gen? Its quite funny bc my fyp on tik tok is all abaut how the m4 ipad is better than the S9tab ultra lol poeapole dont understand that the ipda uses a laptop chip lol meanwhile the S9Tab ultra uses an mobile chip İ thought m4 you know the car bmw m4 competition We need to stop getting so wowed by thin electronics, it hurts durability and increases repair difficulty IPhone or ipad not like because more things are free on Android The funny thing is when there is so much comment about how it don’t make sense for people to spend so much for a machine to watch YouTube and Netflix, people are still willing to buy this machine at this amount of price. bro didnt want to loose the money on the ipad so he made a video of it and made alot more I know why! Because you will ship it to me for free! 😜 Me watching him say I don’t need a MacBook if I buy this iPad having just spent 1800 on an M3 MacBook Air with 16GB As a tablet user:<br>Digital art. Need I say more. Bor me wat why these npc&#39;s keep buying useless sh*t like tablets? I&#39;m watching this on a samsung😂😂😂 You are a salesman trying to convince people to buy an overpriced tablet, shame on you First question I had seeing the new camera array - how about &quot;spatial video&quot;? Wasn&#39;t that a &quot;Pro&quot; feature? Is this a way to foreshadow they are killing the Vision Pro, or are they doing single camera and lidar magic? wake me up when it will be able to run photoshop, illustrator and premier pro. I am watching Apple employees praising their products. Hahaha 😂😂😂😂 The top spec IPad is $2599 in the US. Even with the highest sales tax in the country at nearly 10% the Ipad will still be less than $2900. Not sure how the one sold in the UK is so much more expensive. Can you drop the video now please?! 👀 The only reason is because he has the money. Best $2100 I’ve ever spent. IS THIS A SPONSORED VIDEO BY APPLE? 😮 I would never spend that kind of money on a tablet with a shitty camera. The camera had better be the same as the iphone. Nobody is buying this for the camera Because you’re a tech YT channel and if you didn’t, your views would drop Weren’t tablets 500 bucks? 4.40 I am also so surprised, why does someone need an iPad if they need to use something without touching it? Get a Macbook then! 😅 Zenless zone zero??? damn you probbably should have got a surfice but onistly its yout decition <br>Video recomendation: conpare the ipad to a surfice I do understand the excitement about this tablet and it feels like it is one of those utopia gadgets but... It is not going to replace the laptop for me, since, gaming on pc is the only kind of game play (excluding the virtual games) I am good at. It is gonna be good when it becomes a norm for all of the tablets, than we are gonna see it being used by scientist on the field as well. I mean they are using them already, but can not use it for everything as of now. This is just an example though. Pure stupidity….Apple Fanboy that eats up anything Apple offers up. Because you can As long as the iPad has a good “writing”/matte screen protector it’s  pretty sweet to use the Apple Pencil with.<br> I like to use extra fine nibs as well. Just don’t skimp out on them, if you drop your pen they will break, stay in the 8-12 dollar price range and they tend to last longer. Please say US dollars, not dollars; There&#39;s a lot of different dollars and that makes you sound wrong in most countries a macbook air with a touch screen, no keyboard and ipad os What is bro yapping about sounds to me that you are just making excuses to buy a new unnecessary gadget. I mean I would spend that if I had a channel with this size 🤣🤣 3.7million views  as the time of commenting  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re okay. The real reason he spent $3600 is because he can . Isn’t this more powerful than my 2016 MacBook Pro 15 inch? I’m just worried about the battery for video editing lol. Can I stream games from this? I bet it runs Genshin really well. But again. Battery.. aspect ratio of screen bothers me the most. What should I buy an iPad Pro with the magic keyboard or a Mac Pro or a surface pro. What is better for students and better for your money Me with a iPad mini 4 💀 because you wanted and because you can Why? You are out of your mind? I get that the performance is great and everything but WHY JUST WHY would apple remove an ENTIRE CAMERA??? Like it makes no sense macbook should really be there for developers and those who benefit from accessing file system, command line, calculation power. also if you need SD-port or such. otherwise iPad is a decent alternative. I use it to study Spanish by reading Nat Geo Espanol. It&#39;s much more convenient that reading paper newspapers cause of integrated dictionary (+AI), markup possibilities and internet access. Because you have an Awesome tech channel and bags of cash? Will you please check out the deminsity 9400 , sounds like Darth Vader s hard on lol what&#39;s the game&#39;s name because why not? you have the money bro Dude decided to spent $3600 on a product that costs $999. that&#39;s ± R61 000.😦 that&#39;s a price of a second hand VW Citi Golf. Maybe the damn manufacturers should stop using glue. Can someone gift me the 2TB pro version with the pencil and keyboard please 👉🏻👈🏻 coco melon watchers gonna go crazy for this Is there a file manager on this iPad? Can you copy your files to a thumb drive if you want? Could be a good machine for digital artists, but knowing apple, it&#39;s probably a trash device restricted so much that it&#39;s unusable for anything other than watching youtube videos, the device is only for the rich people like you who want to flaunt the apple logo, but sadly that too is futile because Noone is impressed by an apple logo anymore.<br>A device like this could be the future for digital artists, if it would run a full desktop style operating system without restrictions, and it would be super powerful so as to do stuff like digital sculpting or 3d painting or vector design etc professionally, but the software on a mobile os would be restricted so much that it would be a very expensive toy. Also the pencil is perhaps not pressure sensitive either. This device seems awesome, just not easy on your budget. 💰 😳 yapping 100 I find apps on the iPad brain dead compared to apps on the Mac.  I do agree Netflix and entertainment apps are great on an iPad. Now you are actually a apple representative 😂 justifying $3600 price tag just as 60hz screen on iphone 15 That grey sweater looks cool 👍🏼 Idk how he got to 3600. I maxed everything out and only came to 3046. (Which is still absurd) I think it’s because he’s from britain This should have a Mac OS option for this with this hardware having a hybrid switch between Mac OS and iPad OS because iPad OS is crap for pro applications and pro work. wow that wall garden is really high for this guy. so glad i am on linux Bro, I could buy a f***ing car of that money What the hell is a smart toothbrush? this is something i wont be buying its not like you can afford it @@Xplays27363 are u sure? LOL i have m2 ipad pro, with the overpriced keyboard and pencil 2, just to watch youtube. are u sure i cant afford this m4 ipad pro? Nah my $15 pen from Amazon is good for me 😂 what is that game hes playing on the ipad i can&#39;t find nuthin bout it anywhere 😐 I love your videos ❤❤ You are now feeling exactly how i felt three years ago when I got the M1 pro and spent $2,300 USD hoping it would be a one stop replacement for all my devices. unfortunately i still have a desktop, laptop, WACOM, and the IPAD is sitting on a shelf doing nothing. Apple needs to unlock the capabilities of the IPAD to run desktop applications.  Holding it back so that consumers buy both a MacBook and a IPAD is frustrating. Tablets are have bigger screens and are much cheaper than phones. broo, your son is going to be pround of you 🤣🤣🤣 Pls can you buy me a quest 3 Android user here. Saw the add and came to see what&#39;s that about of pure curiosity. That price is absolutely crazy! Anyways, if you watch it back it does sound like a good ad for Apple and at the same time shows you why Apple isn&#39;t giving you a touch screen laptop! Honestly, your vid gives you all the reasons why rid off Apple. And in the end, you&#39;ll be connecting it to a bigger screen at home. Oh well, if you got the 💷 💷 then spend them. And next year Apple will come up with their best yet again and some will be checking if they have any body organs left to sell. Enjoy What about HDMI screen sharing When the tablet screen costs more than a used car FML 🤦\\u200d♂️ this era 3600? 😂 Lmao no one cares just say your broke less battery than previous generation will be a deal breaker for me. no one gonna talk abt what he was doing w the toothbrush at the start of the video...💀 I still can&#39;t see going from a 34&quot; monitor (or a 32&quot; and a 27&quot;) to a small screen like that. Most people aren&#39;t running around so much to work full time with this. Also, this is like all stolen from the Surface which is still a PC. Granted, the screen looks amazing and would be a fine second system to travel with but I couldn&#39;t see doing actual work on it. toothbrush was sus... aint gonna lie. needing extra storage when you have 2 tb goes crazy 😭 😭 me with my 64 gb Because you can? Everybody switch from ipad pro to samsung s9 ultra with so much more fonction over the Apple offer, with his massive 14 inch screen, we are far from phone experience, the only thing missing are the apple jailled final cut but everyting else are better on android. The s9 ultra 1tb for €1247 GBP with a better pencil expérience included. Why is no one talking about the godzilla in the background? Battery life and storage are 2 things I&#39;d never wanna compromise on😅😅 my apple pencil has been lost for over 2 years MI only one who noticed his new hair look:) No one is doing it I want to see this line up tested:<br><br>iPad m4 13 inch 9c binned chip<br>iPad m4 13 inch 10c full chip <br>iPad m4 11 inch 9c binned chip<br>iPad m4 11 inch 10c full chip<br><br>Battery life is very important to me the full chip seems overkill/overrated for the price required to get it. So I’m just curious if having 1 less performance core nets you any battery life gain. icloud subscription doesnt give you more disk space Honest answer: because you wanted to get views and a nice tax deductible You sure know how to use that toothbrush 🪥 I just built a PC with a 4070 to super and a 7800x3d CPU Asus gaming motherboard so on it was little over $2000 total for something that not even close in power to my PC cost more then if I would gotten a 4090 that&#39;s insane Must be nice spend $3600 on a iPad The First <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=90\">1:30</a> Minutes i was like: Finallyyyyy Someone who Gets me why i don’t Own an ipad Got to see these in person, thinking about replacing my 2020 macbook pro with this. This is a sponsored video 📹 ah yes<br><br>one of the most powerful apple product to watch netflix on Apple sucks. Dont recommend Actually the pencil from last years iPad Pro has a spot that does the same towards the tip Bigger question is how does one even spend 3600.00 on an ipad? All those things he said at the beginning about tablets being the same as a phone is the whole reason I looked for one that was different than a phone and that means it has to be running a full fat operating system. <br><br>For those that don&#39;t know a full fat operating system is something like Windows, Linux or Mac OS.<br><br>Yes I&#39;m beating around the bush. I bought a Surface tablet. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=756\">12:36</a> woooah, that&#39;s one way to say chillin&#39; with the homies... You&#39;re spot on, But oft times I need direct phone to phone call which iPad does not do. and Samsung Tabs do. What was that 3d app? It is a no for me, that much for for an Ipad, I would rather buy a high end gaming pc or gaming laptop😅 Can the you do hardcore programming on the iPad like one can do on a pc? Congrats on ur wedding Arun <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=520\">8:40</a> anyone who actually own a gaming pc or console WHEN ARE YOU MAKING AN IPHONE 😢😢😢 I usually like these videos but at the start saying that &quot;..they have a big redesign..&quot; is kind of a stretch. Sure they have a new chip and screen. But didn&#39;t most new generations of iPad improve over the previous? Yes it&#39;s way better but it&#39;s not like a complete redesigned Do you know what&#39;s better than a slim iPad? A waterproof iPad! How did they miss the mark on that? 😂 after i bought near 576$ in tab S8 i thought i&#39;m going to get laptop replacement to do working outside home, but now i use it only for tiktok, youtube, and playing other media stuff.. in fact in just less then a week ago i bought HP Pavilion Plus 14 for 790$ and my productivity going up as exactly as i wanted, it got enough battery, can still play AAA game, better in work stuff.. 🙁feel like those 576$ wasted Ha! I don’t have a computer, but I do have an iPhone 14 Pro Max. This phone is all I need for my online existence. Let&#39;s not kid anyone. You spent it because you can afford it. I hate laptops and only use tablets. The sound quality on the M4 is very very poor compared to the 2018 ipad pro. Regrettable purchase. I think tablets have become more popular in children as parents would limit the age of having a phone which, in my opinion, has become ridiculously young. I am not too sure why it is specifically tablets although I have seen many children under the age of 10 with full-on gaming pcs! I don’t see why children can’t just have a tablet to play games on instead of them needing a phone, a laptop and a gaming pc. Honestly I get that older children in their teens might be ready for another level of gaming with more advanced technology. Maybe if someone wanted to borrow a parent/guardians’s laptop if they wanted to do something they can’t do on a tablet. But some things kids have, they really do not need. If only it was thicker so it has more protection and battery,it would&#39;ve been perfect You can get mobile app on your macbook btw If you buy the based macbook air with 4gb of ram and with a keyboard for 999 but the ipad also cost 999 but yoy need to pay 400 dollars for a keyboard and another 120 dollars for the pen for that amont of money get your self a macbook with ram upgrades I got 2 ads of 20 sec of moto which is unskipable 💀💀💀 Arun hovering over the buy button and thinking he can get the money for it through a review video. So a free ipad technically. 😂 IPAD PRO M4 VS GALAXY TAB S9 ULTRA 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 Hey Mr who&#39;s the boss, can you do an EDC video Never seen as biased a video from this account before. I&#39;m not saying you got paid for this, I just think you gave a veryy personal review of how you just love this product, instead of giving the rather unbiased and sensible reviews you usually give for any product. Bro has literally bought everything in this world😂😂 bro plizz donate me your new iphone 15🙏 imm using old poco x2😭 your poor big fan are you in Vienna? Sold your soul bro, you don&#39;t deserve respect anymore May you please make a review of the Samsung Galaxy A55 5G Hi Bro How are you ?<br>I want to buy these electronic devices how it&#39;s possible ? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=519\">8:39</a> what is bro doing You spent $3500 on the iPad Pro M4 because you could earn over $100,000+ making a 16 minute video about it. Wanted to buy MacBook Air because other laptops feel cheap (no 2k+ tag price), later I came on idea like in this video to replace laptop with iPad, sounded good...but then I installed Adobe Acrobat Reader on my iPhone and immediately monthly plan was &quot;offered&quot; after 7 days trial, so I deleted the app, canceled my decision to buy iPad or MacBook because I don&#39;t want to pay for every fuc**ng thing on it to make it usable. Despite having USB-C on iPhone I wasn&#39;t able to transfer files to external storage from downloads, so I had to find a way to send files on Windows PC despite having iTunes, this lead me to decision that my next phone will be again android, but still I watched the video :) Until iPads run Node js and VS Code they can’t ever ‘replace’ a mac for me I&#39;ve been waiting for iPad full review video and coming to your channel every day to check if you&#39;ve uploaded or not. I wonder what&#39;s taking you so long or you are not interested in making a review video? this pro is just obliterating the whole point of the ipad air Still not as thin as the Vivo X5 max. I remember in one of his videos, he showed a website where we can see all the phone camera and the sensors, and if we click on those, we can go to all the phones which uses the same camera sensor. I just remember that the website logo was something blue in colour so if anyone can tell me the website name, I would be really grateful. ipad is not for games is not forever it has a time period where it is for games after that lag it is 😅😅😅 Tables are the best at media consumption <br>10 inch oled is all someone needs to watch yt or tv shows from the bed They copy the s24 ultra screen..sucks apple It&#39;s just a nerfed MacBook, Apple is trying to replicate Microsoft Surface with this new iPad, the power of PC and tablets all into one...and they are getting closer to cloning it. I mean, by 2030 iPads have to get the power of an MacBook. I brought it, i am constantly anxious about it bending. Carrying a 4000 dollar worth product in a backpack specially for a college student, who takes public transport, gets constantly get  banged into things, bumping into ppl (LIVING LIFE) skate boarding, re sold it brought Samsung A9 (I am so.happy) i sometimes use it as a frisbee (not kidding) i am so happy. No point in keeping the tab at home or be constantly worry (anxious) about when it being in backpack, even with cover on. Cant believe Arun and me are of same age but living completely different lives (i love my life). Being a YouTuber is exhausting, imagine being in a constant state of carrying this, or it getting stolen. You should keep it in a bank. Laptops are more durable, even macs for that matter. Good luck, i hope it works well for you. Can you gift a cheapest ipad air? I have a dream to illustrate there through procreate 🥹 Not a smart tooth brush?! lol Imagine spending 💲3600 on a tablet only to watch Netflix. Can💎 Honor magic 6 could be the new android king👑 🥶 This feels like a sponsored video. You are so beautiful 😘🇺🇸 But do you want to work on a 13” tablet I can see the XDR through the screen. Ever heard of UTM? If you don’t need your laptop send it my way I’ll give it a good home 😂 the backround looks soooooooo fake<br>not a hater shits too expensive these days &quot;I feel like i&#39;m not holding an Oversized phone&quot;<br>Take a look at the iPad Mini 6. Been using the galaxy tab s8 for about 2yrs now and absolutely love it. Had no need to buy a laptop as it does what i want it to do. Usec to love laptops. But those days are long gone. Havi g the same chipset tha5 my s23 ultra has isnt a downside. Our mobile chips are stupid powerful that smartphones dont really make the best use case. Th3 only fail point is gaming. Well that is if you want to play console like games. But other than that i never felt the need for a more powerful cpu.<br><br>My pc is where i will be productive enough that i actually need power. I have a 7950x3d, 3080 12gb, 32gb 6000 cl32 ram. And a bunch of storage. I dont need my tablet to do what my pc does. I just need my tablet to do what my phone does but better. Remote playing ps5, using youtube. Browsing web etc. And cause i own a s23 ultra and a tab s8 i can use wireless samsung dex. So i can have access to the internet and use my tablet. Is it a perfect experience? No but it is a usable one. And i dont pay anything extra.<br><br>But by and large the number 1 thing i do on my tablet is read. Novels, manga, light novels, web novels etc. The screen size is fantastic. My tablet allows me to do 80% of what i did with my laptop. Its smallernthan a laptop, thinner than a laptop. Better battery life than a laptop. Easier to travel around with over a laptop. And what it fails at doing my pc does and does it much better than any laptop or tablet could ever hope for it to do.<br><br>Hell cause i own my tablet i have never felt the need for a dual monitor. My 55&quot; 4k 120hz vrr qled is all i ever felt like i needed cause i can use my tablet to do s3cond screen function without being a second screen. Or i can even use it as a second screen for my pc. Except have it wireless. So i can lay down in my bed and use my wireless keyboard and mouse and just lay down and use it that way. <br><br>Tablets are fantastic. And heres the thing that $3600 tablet will perform very similarly in daily life that my $1000 tablet can do. The niche edge case of using the video editing on the go isnt worth 2000. And it wont perform as good as a computer. Its a waste of money. Because you&#39;re rich? Can you Bless me with iPhone please Dude I saw wish to know why don&#39;t you review huawei gadgets cuz you are a tech reviewing channel but you don&#39;t entertain huawei products anymore it&#39;s been a while since you last spoke about huawei.... Even with the section from the united state we still want to know about it I still use my old iPad GEN six for drawing I have a question, why does Samsung insist on making fun of Apple and then does the same thing?  For example, when Apple took the phone adapter out of the box, they mocked Apple like clowns, then they did it themselves, or Apple introduced a titanium phone.  Then Samsung came and copied Apple. Do a experia 1 mark 6 review and give your feedback please yeah your play head video isn&#39;t sponsored why put it? I could buy a Apple Vision Pro for almost that price &quot;mummy my skibidi toilet is bent&quot; The dude just spent the entire video trying hard to convince himself why he NEEDS the new iPad Pro over the M3 Max MacBook Pro 💀 Looks more like samsung tab s9 ultra Apple is just a brand not a useful product... Similar to Gucci or other famous brands and are just for showing off... Where&#39;s the ipad you spent 3.6k on? i bet someone would spend $3,600 for an ipad just to draw ok lets see how he show of today Bro please giveaway me ps4 only please🥺 Because you&#39;ve got money and you are making more from it with this video Apple fanboy WIth two displays the battery performance should actually increase if you&#39;re not having it at full blast. 2x at 50% is going to be way more efficient than 1x 100%. Same as with CPU&#39;s or GPUs. The last 10-20% will cost a huge price.<br><br>So if you&#39;re just using it &quot;normal&quot; i&#39;d even expect the battery life to be better and hence Apple decided to go for a thinner size and a lighter battery. Case 46 — Smart Money<br>Case 47 — Uncivil Rights<br>Case 48 — Blood in the Blender<br>Case 49 — Immortal Sin<br>Case 50 — Programmed to Kill @Mrwhosetheboss does have a point. From my experience doing app and web development I ended up having more customers who trusted/stayed with me if I directed them to contact me via common apps than when trying to redirect them to my website or email. As of right now, that extra sense of security that people get knowing something comes directly from the PlayStore (Google) and AppStore (Apple) makes doing business a lot easier. The iGlad pun almost made me unsubscribe You have a very large platform and yet you never mentioned Palestine. Why? Day 9 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. ❤❤❤😊 You gotta make one unboxing video for huawei pura 70 ultra😮 Why at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=442\">7:22</a> all the people is freezing? Apple still would want their macbooks to sell so they would never make the ipads to have all the capabilities of macbook. The magic.keyboard try the three dots in the bottom of an iPad I called them the magic dots for some reason <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=231\">3:51</a> I want a home button and lightning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=4\">0:04</a> Removing the magnetic charging feature is not taking the Apple Pencil to a whole new level I believe you might find the Tab S9 Ultra to be a more suitable device for your needs. With its desktop mode, you can accomplish a wider range of tasks on Android, including running desktop operating systems, games, and applications. Cool, 100.000,00 R$ gadget. Most useless product ever. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=385\">6:25</a> Is that fckin AutodeskMudbox running smoothly on IPad? One big use for iPads: music! The full-size iPad pros with a foot pedal to turn pages are legitimately the best way to store music at this point, basically no matter what. The only issue is that if they freeze during a performance you’re screwed, but they’re still really nice. Plus, paper has the exact same issue, just in different ways (missed or failed page turn, music falls off stand, for some reason your part’s in the wrong order, etc) I&#39;m sticking with my 256GB M1 Ipad pro. I don&#39;t need to upgrade since I mostly use my Ipad to watch TikTok for bigger picture than my phone. 😂 I have the 11” M2 cellular iPad Pro and it’s definitely a ‘freeing’ sort of device. You can pop it open ANYWHERE (on the bus, in the middle of a field), work on something with cellular, close it, and go. No wifi to worry about, and phone OSes are apps are built to be interrupted. The small size also makes it super easy to use on the go (I personally think 11” is the sweet spot), and my MacBook is now getting a lot less usage. I wish I had the new one, it would be so useful with that amazing calculator, man I’m doing Geometry over the summer right now, and get algebra 2 my next school year, that new IOS 18 ipad calculator would be so useeful Apple is a joke, they aren&#39;t what they use to be Great video Most powerful adult movie streamer 😂 Can you do one on Huawei&#39;s new phone Ps. <br>Mrwhosetheboss can you send me a game boy I&#39;m sorry this is a waste of money. No sane person should want to spend over $1000 on any tablet. If you have the money sure whatever but this pricepoint it&#39;s bizarre to even entertain the idea of such a device. you won&#39;t have your iPad organized like a PC then just use the PC launcher it has all the features of the PC so now you&#39;re organized too I can it&#39;s a macbook and an iPad at the same time. So instead of going to 2, you can get this one instead. And the M4 chip is a monster, not sure it runs big tasks yet. Probably gonna buy this after a couple years waiting for the price to go down. Sir please I can&#39;t afford a iPhone 11 pro and I&#39;m from Nigeria please can I get one free from you Free Palestine 🇵🇸 All they need to do is let it swap between Mac OS and iPad os and they will sell out Ipad&#39;s big buser are students and you didn&#39;t even mention onec. <br>Also, I felt it&#39;s a biased video. Just clicked to see people commenting how ridiculous that title is.<br>Worth it 😂, what a joker this guy is Apple want you to buy bad laptop with bad ipad if you try to be smart all this was already available on the old ipad pro .. no idea why you are switching now iPad kids just got a upgrade Id take my MBP any day. My tablet is an old Microsoft Surface 3 Pro I bought for 100$. It has i5, 256GB SSD and 8GB ram, 2k display and a decent keyboard. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> woah woah chill bro JUST AN ACTUAL LAPTOP FAM! THAT&#39;S A BRAND NEW GAMING LAPTOP MONEY RIGHT THERE You said you paid 3,600 but at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=816\">13:36</a> you say you want to keep a close eye on battery life &quot;while you are testing&quot; I know the answer: Cause Apple paid you 36,000$ for the advertisement, right? xD I think samsung payed more Capitalism at it&#39;s best. Convincing us to buy to look into screens even more. I like the touch of the uniball porn hitting my scribe book. I could really get this, but not when it costs that much 1 Your have they money Friend <br>2 Your make a video 🤨 i would be happy have this Tablett use all the nice apps inside (  exklusive) only the apple eco system Buy 3600 USD ipad for google docs and home automation, netflix and youtube.. yea.. right bro really bought an tablet worth more than a apple vision pro 💀 Arun is doing tricks on it Apple always say that is their best product so far Nice one Did he forget to mention that this is a sponsored video ? 😂😂😂😂 they need to make an ipad macbook 2-in-1 combo lol I spent 3800$ on my iPad Pro from 2022 with max stats aka best specs and software with 2tb and cellular capabilities so worth it!! Still use it to this day! That&#39;s a very clever video. Well done. Thank you! please review Sony Xperia 1 VI and make a camera comparison with Samsung S24 Ultra Reveiw @huawei matebook E 2022 Y know why its dumb bc the keyboard plus pen is actualy much heavier than a mac 😂 BRO, I replaced my laptop to galaxy s7 like years ago.😂 They offer you a F1, but install the system for bicycle. 😅 Question?<br>Did you start making your own phone?<br>Untill you reach apple sub. Not related to the video but WHY ISNT GOOGLE LENS DIRECTLY INCORPORATED INTO THE ANDROID CAMERA. WHAT A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. So the only way to not have an Apple notch now is to get an iPad. OK. May i ask<br>Where is the setting? Imagine making a 16 minutes videos without having the product &quot;Because computer OS is more open it would be easier to pirate there&quot;. <br><br>I mean not really. Everything is and will be in the internet globally and in most case faster than in any app. While I dont feel the need to download anymore the older I get since I can watch them whenever on streaming services, there is no doubt that torrenting is in a lot of cases better user experience. I get the file and can do whatever I want with it. Buy a movie from one of these companies? Cant store it wherever I want and keep a copy. Company goes under, all paid content gone. Licensing agreements change, they yank what you bought from you. And its not like these restrictions do anything about piracy, the files that give you free personal use will be in the internet anyways pretty much instantly. If I cant download a file from a movie/series that I bought for and store it wherever I want and watch it offline/burn to blu-ray then I didnt really buy it didnt I? look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=274\">4:34</a> on ths video, haha. I see 3 hands. Did you use midjourney to make this video? Love your videos, thank you for all the effort you put into them! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen so much dedication on YouTube before. Hope you&#39;re taking time to focus on yourself as well❤ wishing you all the best! it’s like to have a bugatti  and 80 km limit What if you drop it by accident on the floor, is it sturdy enough to not cause a void in your soul when that happens.. Useless just like the vr headset something you use once and forget you have it slap a keyboard on it and you have a Mac air lol 😂 Apple in the event &quot;this is our thinnest product ever&quot; haven&#39;t you heard about apple card 🤨 You should give me your MacBook pro Watching this on a 90 dollar android tablet Wich is insane for gaming and everything I use it for everything and it&#39;s more powerful than my laptop<br>Also btw they took away one of the cameras on the ipad, so dont waste 3000 on an ipad he didnt actually bought the ipad but gave a review just by looking at it once in the apple store 🤡🤡 What was the name of your photo editing app? Bs Spen by apple lol In dubai it costs 4,100+ AED Apple didn’t give you one for review? Waiting for Zack @JerryRigEverything to do his magic on this😂 So you can make a video of it and earn I feel that the most comfortable form factor to hold is an A4 sized clipboard. <br>I used one of these a lot when I was working as a Laboratory Technician in Maynooth University.<br><br>I would LOVE to see a tablet that is A4 size with eInk display and a stylus/pen. “Hello guys and welcome to bored smashing” I am really looking forward to seeing the new Studio. When you realise this one iPad is worth more than multiple items at your home combined. Why i spent 3600$ for a tablet ?<br><br>Because i am super rich idiots For the new iPad being a full Laptop replacement It would need to run MacOs at least for me. laptops come with pens.  touch screens etc..   Are you simply saying that you want to replace your pc with a tablet? oh so yes Simply because you can afford and you need to review it for money Just letting you know, for each storage option, the amount of ram increases and decreases. Could you please review the Redmi Turbo 3 Its been a while since you havent unboxed stuff what a insane waste of money. could have bought a desk a gaming pc a 2k high refresh screen. gaming pro mouse and keyboard. and even a gaming chair with gaming headphones and you still wouldnt have spent 3600$ Remember This is more expensive than the f*cking Vision Pro Like to see video  about sony xpira 1 vi OMG pls make a video of the reMarkable 2 plsssssssssssssssssssssssss I still dont understand why you spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4. We still are waiting for that gaint iPhone!! 3600$? I can buy the full Huawei ecosystem with that money 😂 Sorry Apple but no way. me with 256gb on macbook air happy still.. liekick roller skate shoes review please 🙏🙏 Different to other comments, I find only one area where iPad OS still absolutely sucks: File Management. In every conceivable way. Well, I do need lots of Windows programs for work, and some legacy programs that won&#39;t run on iPad OS – but do on Windows 11 for ARM on an M1 MacBook. So I have to wait for retirement to switch … looking forward to this moment! Do u play Valorant ? 🌚 How long you will take to beat apple Imagine buying a 3.6k ipad without calculator💀💀😭 Another expensive over hardware spec tablet and yet still has the same capability of a 2021 Ipad pro because of a deliberately nerfed locked OS. Normies eat it up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=601\">10:01</a> I definitely don&#39;t like when a product sends me to their app. First, not everything needs an app. App-less products do not depend on servers. 2. A website or a browser is very powerful tool, you can manage all sorts of things. An app takes space from your device and can collect all sorts of personal data and you have little to no chance to control it. 3. A Pad with a clipable keyboard is just a thin laptop or Ultrabook but with limited opportunities. how does this work with apple vision pro gaming on mac does suck A LOY I miss the old MRWTB videos, now its just clicked bait and flashy garbage. Field day for @JerryRigEverything How do tablets have bigger updates and changes then iPhones. Bro i just want the iPad Air Get duke 390 or Aprilia 450 Sure, on a laptop you can&#39;t download Netflix shows and movies from the app. Instead, all you need to do is run one terminal command and you have full download access to every show and movie ever made. One day soon, if not very soon, iPads will replace MacBooks. Unrelatable, spend $3600, to do the same thing you&#39;re doing today, but slightly lighter. iPad Pro<br>That should include:<br>- Mag Safe<br>- Weather Sealed<br>- 3 Camera Lenses <br>- Pencil 3 with Eraser feature <br>- M Pro/Ultra Chip<br>- Extended Battery Life<br>- Thicker Design Apple have completely lost the plot. Here in Oz, the top ipad is $4500. That is just absurd. If o bought this thing it would be for movies and YouTube nothing more i perfer doing it on my laptop more tho Imagine they would make this ipad in an imac size haha Chuck doesn&#39;t use iPads. iPads use Chuck to buy more $CHUCK to save more dogs with charity donations @CHUCK_on_Base I have that I mean....... 2 in 1 PCs like the Surface has been doing that for years but with an actual desktop OS but ok 🤷🏾\\u200d♂️ But still can&#39;t replace the laptop 💻 ✌🏻 so no need to compare it with laptop 😅 You are right, but isnt that a Software Thing? Bro I still have a iPad Pro M2 Can anyone put a link or something to the parallax view app? 😁👍 He cuts away every branch of mine that doesn&#39;t produce fruit. But He trims clean every branch that does produce fruit, so that it will produce even more fruit.\\r<br>John 15:2 CEV you cant replace a macbook with an ipad if you use google. ipad browser is not a desktop browser... its very disappointing SCP 2450 💀🤕 People who contribute nothing to the world He has 18.6 Million Subscribers @@svensantesson2020 Awesome.Yet he adds nothing. @@sutherlandshots2954 Thats a very lonely opinion @@svensantesson2020 Not at the end of the world.Millions of followers cant do shit. @@sutherlandshots2954 I Respect your opinion, but He entertains me, and i dont think im alone With that I wont get you to help build my house.Or fix my tap. except the screen, I don&#39;t really think its an upgrade over my M1 iPad Pro🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ Not a fan of the UI and UX of phones and tablets, and would never dream about anything else but light editing on phone - that said you might have sold me on the remarkable 2 tablet for sketching out ideas if it&#39;s capable of exporting to a computer where i can actually use the things, rather than just looking pretty on a device i&#39;d only use for actual production and never look at outside of that.<br><br>To be specific what i don&#39;t like about mobile UI/UX is how everything is hidden away behind multiple buttons/tabs/slides due to the lack of space Everyone complains about the price while standing in line to purchase it hmmm retina The Apple product designed for Fools by the Fools Am I the only one that cant stand anymore hearing the word &quot;experience&quot;🤔  ? i never really cared for the ipad pro models. i mainly just us my ipad to check my email and watch youtube and my streaming apps so i dont kill my phone bro I would just spend all that money on a very good pc build You should buy me one for school lol can i get one plz <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=967\">16:07</a> not the yoda grammar 😭🙏 Nano texture is just like an anti glare Matt screen.

Buying an iPad was the biggest mistake ever for me… we need such a software which we can switch between macOS iOS ipadOS, they could do a lot more things but they don&#39;t because some of the products can not be sold anymore damn you&#39;re rich af. so basically iPads are dumb when u have a MacBook. only uses are drawing, designing stuff. ( accuracy with pencil ) and lastly to visualise plans,  THATS ALL - ANY OTHER REASON IS STUPID. Day 8 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. Why are you making so much pro apple stuff. Never have an Apple be repaired? You where from all tech to now just apple stuff. I am out.

Why isnt it worth 3600$?<br><br>Because your 150$ Motorola can do the Same? I&#39;d rather get an Ipad Pro M3 and a Macbook..

What 😂😂😂 Absolute ripp off.. Could buy a top quality Gaming PC  for that kind of money.. what the hack thats nearly 1 million in pkr. no middle class person earns this kind of money in a year here. Because i like wasting money. ..I have the mp 126gb iPad Pro in space gray (2023) it’s 12.9inches Which phone do you recommend <br>1)one plus 12R<br>2)iphone 12<br>3)samsung s23 S23 I love how you always deliver so uniquely. Good work. Currently broke my laptop, can you assist me get one for my computer engineering degree Get a life The biggest problem with iPad OS is the horrible file management! It sucks you&#39;re about to buy it because you&#39;re a youtuber who needs content to make money and you have enough money from youtube to buy crap like this, there i answered your dumb question The only problem is the price. And, yes, it&#39;s my problem. Hmmmm, mine spec’d out for $4000, so what upgrades did you miss? wow cool &quot;why I spend $3600 on an ipad&quot;<br><br>Because you have too much money to waste Game name Was these shot on the apple vision pro? I wait for the Video „X amount of Time I replaced my Laptop with the iPad“ from @MrWhoIsTheBoss Got a ad about that note book of yours I make it short „tax write off“ @MrWhoIsTheBoss This man isx4 the most successful utube guy you will ever meet! Can you code .Net applications on that iPad? Is it just me or does anyone else want him to buy all the razer blade laptops Hate apple all you want. Their tech are engineering marvels Enjoyable video. One thing though, I genuinely prefer to use a company’s website than their apps. Time and again I discover that the app is a dumbed down version of their website, and I eventually have to ditch the app to use their website to get full functionality. One example is MailChimp. There are features that just aren’t available through the app and so I log into their website via the iPad’s browser. Most of the time, a website has functions that a company’s app simply does not. Let me correct you, I don&#39;t know where you get that price, here in USA the price is $1300  plus keyboard $350 and $125 the Pen total of  $1775.00 Not me watching this vid on a iPad mini 4 😂 Tough choice!<br><br>I am in the same boat not knowing which way to go.<br>iPad Pro or MacBook Pro- for me personally I want the storage space but can’t justify the top tier price off the iPad Pro just for that and then there is connectivity issues with SD Cards that I use plus how do I get the additional storage connected to my iPad Pro?<br><br>I can’t figure this out so someone please help me 🙏<br><br><br>What I do …<br>I love watching movies and just want to edit YouTube videos plus store all my audiobooks (about 1-2TB worth) and have everything in one place for easy access etc<br><br>I just can’t figure out what to get other then buy both a MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro and that’s not in my budget lol 😂 Quite honeslty I don&#39;t understand the review. Most of the advantages you mentioned have been around for previous generations as well. If you want a laptop, get one. No need to spend money on apple trash. 🗣️ Hey Arun, I know ur probably not going to see this, but I wanted to let you know I can tell when you use AI to help you write your scripts, especially at the end and it doesn’t sound good so pls go back to not using ai ‼️ Apple is trash. <br>There is absolutely no justification for paying this much on a tablet. <br>With 3600$:<br>I buy a new PC extremly good with high end GPU 2000$<br>I buy a mid range samsung tablet (S9 FE is a pretty good deal) + androind phone + accessories + headphones for ~ 1000$<br>I burn the rest rather than buying an apple product.<br><br>Of course, given I have this much in the first place You haven’t gotten to the dad jokes yet. As someone who works in app and web dev industry. I for one hate downloading apps for everything. Web is overall just better and will usually not hoard resources of your device as long as you have good hygiene whereas apps can get access to all sorts of weird local hardware level access and I don’t trust that with every rando app out there. I just spec&#39;d out an iPad here in the states and it&#39;s only $2599 fully spec&#39;d... you guys are getting ripped of in the UK lol Poor Europeans getting ripped off. The official Apple site says $999 My bad $2000 Thanks for insight, I had 2 year ago I buy Ipad pro 12inc. and you comments convince me that I need to get this also . Just ordered it. Thank you for the great work you do. Apple, just make a detachable laptop  🙄 I&#39;m kind of the same, I have an iPhone, an Apple Watch, and recently got the MacBook Air 13&quot; M2 (what I am using) I don&#39;t see a need for an iPad if I have a MacBook, if I were to buy any new Apple Product, it would be a new phone, since the 11 only has 64GB, and that&#39;s why this has 512GB The girls at my college do NOT use/need $3600 worth of ipad😭😭 Unfortunately, this new $3600 iPad does not survive the toddler bend test. I am confused. The new iPad Pro 13 inch is listed at $1299 in the US, not $3600??? RECENTLY YOU HAVE A BIG FOCUS ON APPLE PRODUCTS <br>🙃 One day it will be a Macbook. You pick. Gaming of a beast PC, or, silly little screen that made of metal My ipad prod 2018 have been very useful as a mobile gaming device and still overpowered in today&#39;s normal games. I checked the apple website it’s says it’s only $1000 id rather buy an M4 rifle for 2,599$ than an ipad for 3,500. Bend it ist like you are talking about the first time seeing an ipad with an keyboard… it dies the same things the los ones with keyboard did. nothing new. ist the same restricted OS with terrible file system (even call it like that), a keyboard that’s probably the worse software keyboard out there. <br><br>it’s quite good in some things but if you really want to work with it. let me tell you from years of letdowns by the software. you will not be able to. <br><br>iPad OS is the worst software implementation for a tablet out there right now. what makes it good are apps like procreate, not the software apple put on there themselves. and samsungs tablets got a huge leap in productivity with there real window management. <br><br>if apple doesn’t announce any change at WWDC, I probably sell my ipad which is then my last apple device. too long time they call it a laptop replacement but it’s not really that for someone who really works digitally. too many restrictions and tons of bugs. Android/Samsung/google or apple and in 4 months, that iPad will collect dust and be used once a week to watch a YouTube video the couch, like all the other iPads. I love having an android phone and an iPad cause iPhones don’t seem worth it at all, but I love the iPad. And still having an android gives me the best of both worlds. I litreally watching this on the ipad m4 pro Old Is gold ❤<br>But it&#39;s good reviews 😅 Hey I saw you in Nottingham city centre a few months ago, but didn’t have the time to say hi. Just wanted to let you know I loved the vids Look at the remixes on this video 💀 The biggest problem of the ipad is that it is still an IPAD. lol No matter how great the screen gets you will still do the same thing as an ipad air or the regular ipad 80% of the time. I have an Ipad air and Im glad I didn&#39;t buy the Ipad pro. For what I do with it basically does the job. The saddest thing is that Apple does know what their doing, if they put a touch screen on a mac its the end for the ipad. the most expensive you can make your iPad is 3077 use by the way Are you smoking grass 🤣 i know why...for the views ...views turn to $$$... I completely disagree with the main point in this video. The reason I don&#39;t like tablets is BECAUSE of the apps. Why do I need to have something permanently installed on my device for practically every single function and use case when I can just do it one time in my browser and they close it? This really is End Game Tablet &lt;3 Hello Arun. Luv your videos Is it a review or Justifying your $3600? Who pays that kind of money for a tablet? Because you have money and to review the product to gain views to earn more money than product. Just simple How much money you got from Tim Apple for this one? you spend $3600 because you can. is it worth the money? NOPE.. you just gotta tell all the apple fanboys that it is though.. useless Mate, you are a ipad person, as you are a tech guy. Lets not get confused. looks like apple had thrown a lot of cash on Mrwhosetheboss AVP 👽 <br>You 🙉 heard why / and they both lost &quot;human trafficking / ... cool cause&quot;Darrell stabs/ I&#39;m tracking .../ Well they are tracking down &quot;groups / in particular &quot;Oakland kids group / ..../ They had been ✌🏾&quot;sleeping / adults ✌🏾&quot;clothed as middle schoolers / <br>AVP 👽 <br>... well at least / i can show ,/ they like to steal my &quot;devices/ ...but , also , .../ They been deleted in lock 🔐 up ( the Ingram hard drive)/ / so not a big deal/ .../ I was thinking of hiding it first .../ Butr then.../ Well , we&quot; broke it.... totally/ / // he wants to talk , on site:/ about /...r Kyle / sweet / not bad ,/ The money 💰 / things like me take their bus 🚌/ ... and it&#39;s sometimes about my ... brain 🧠 and mind ,/ right / so at this point / .../ Nevermind / / hey 👋🏾 &quot;Ranger Norris / ... I&#39;ll ask for you ,/ still here / .../ No not s lot of police&quot;( that i know)/ ...honey 🍯 do&#39;s/ no it&#39;s not / / In general, I feel what is the point of making macbooks if ipads are gonna have keyboards and do almost everything a macbook can do. Now dont quote me on that, because im pretty sure there are still functions a macbook has that a ipad is absent on. But then again i can be wrong. Over all i feel ipads will take over MacBooks in terms of ipads having keyboards, pencils and a wireless mouse (and if possible a wired mouse), and to include also, the fact that the ipads and macbooks use almost or probably completely the same processor. Lastly to include, the prices are crazy, for a ipad that costs 3600 dollars, at that point its not worth it by the prices (probably), you might as well stick with the ipads that have the m2 chips which almost literally does the same thing that the m4 model ones do. 3grand for table is nuts....buy mackbook instead :D Bro please buy me a new Nintendo switch 🥺🥺😌 Ohh !! Pubg mobile..... I need a sponsor 🙌 Just buy the £999 iPad Pro to watch movies.. quad speaker not bad 😎 really.  I prefer watching my movies collection on an iPad Pro compared to my iPhone.. <br><br>Looking forward to the Oled screen ^__^= <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=448\">7:28</a> Bruh, android and ios/ipados are bantamweight operating systems.  The latest phone chips are years and years ahead of anything the operating systems are capable of.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=589\">9:49</a> That&#39;s because everyone and their mom intentionally gimps their websites for mobile operating systems because they can collect more of your data by using apps lmfao.  Pushing everyone toward apps instead of websites is for the data broker industry, not the end user.<br><br>Like, obviously YMMV if tablets work for you but let&#39;s not get it twisted, your enshitification video applies to the whole mobile app ecosystem, not just the platforms you specifically mentioned. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ They made the iPad better than the MacBook, so you can replace it with the iPad, and the next MacBook will be so much better than this iPad, that you&#39;ll want to switch back to MacBook! And so on! Sustainability is key right? Three grand though, really? 🤔 In the laptop segment they had a competition so they extended the battery life, while in tablet segment they are way ahead of the competitors so they didn&#39;t bump the battery!! If m4 uses half the power unlike M2 then why not to leave the battery what was there already?! And that&#39;s the Apple thing!! Making Pro lighter than Air series is totally contradicting the initial concept of bringing &quot;air&quot; in the market! It seems that apple is doing something to cover up or has a massive new plans to get new ppl on the PRO!! And I contributed to that £2 877 iPad price, with 6 ads for a mere 16 minutes video.🚮 “Because any video I make about it will more than pay for the $3,000 iPad.” Slide over and tiling doesn&#39;t work that effectively on iOS. Consequently, you are better off with two screens, whether it be having two iPad Pros or an iPad Pro and an iMac. It makes sense for both to have stands and Magic Keyboards and Mice and at least one to have an Apple Pencil. The extra screen real estate and full screen multitasking beats the performance win of these new tablets. If you want to edit a movie you need a 5K iMac at the very least, if not a Mac Pro. From the looks of things reMarkable works well out of the house away from your desktop due to its long battery life and clear focused UX. Also, try to unplug some of the time whilst you are out and look at some trees! Why? Because your a multi millioner dude 13 inch?! i like you shirt. What is that? Because MrWhoseTheBoss is an Apple super fan (or being rewarded by Apple) and thus there will never be a price point which he would say things are getting ridiculous? Can I get a wedding invite? everything is excellent but one thing is missing i.e AI features. todays era technology is all about AI. apple must TAKE concern on AI. $3600 for a tablet? Bro, let&#39;s get back to reality! People in 2023: 3500$ for a headset?<br>Apple: Oh amateur, you haven’t seen anything yet what&#39;s the game at @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=775\">12:55</a> ? Can fold like paper 💀 I will buy it With YouTube money 💰 Everything sounds so gimmicky. It doesnt feel like any innovation. Doesnt excite the tech freaks. Ipad on a weight loss diet is not what power users want🤣. So much power, m4 chip, for an enlarged iphone is stupidity. Also, the point of buying an ipad dies where the price point reaches. A person being able to pay nearly 4000 dollars for an ipad (with the accessories) would not use the ipad’s power and rather have an macbook/windows or even better, an employee at his studio for the work. And that pencil innovation, stupidest ever. Literally, they can get better ideas from surveys rather than their research team. An eraser on the behind sensor, scrolling using pencil, camera shutter on touch of apple pencil, multiple kind of pencil tips. Thats what would be innovation. innovation which would be worth for an upgrade. none of that. major upgrade is in the price. People with crazy money are only the customers they gonna have. any rationale person would not upgrade to this from 2018 or later model because this is crap and very minor upgrade. lighter weight doesnt matter. thinner ipad doesnt matter, nor does those display numbers. A simple question - what value this ipad provides over the last generation? &quot;Let me tell you about this great new ipad that I am not going to use&quot;. Make sure to do a video how &quot;it&#39;s great but not quite there&quot; in half a year. That&#39;s mandatory part 2. Yep buy a powerful PC and a decent wifi 6 router and stream you desktop to you cheap couple hundred dollars tablet. All of that power, yet i still cant make a B4 1200 ppi illustration in procreate, disappointing I&#39;ve lost so much respect for this channel after this. Can You buy one for me ? ❤❤ I will shortly hand in my<br>Work MacBook and have no PC at home. For me an iPad with keyboard and pencil is the logical choice for a single device. As much as I love the Samsung ecosystem apple do know how to make a tablet and they do better than Samsung because of the M chip Samsung should have a separate chip for the tablets I&#39;m quite happy with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra. Where is that sweatshirt from? Day 7 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. As someone that works in the cinema industry, iPads are actually godly useful for me Full-on computer... LOL :D With an OS like this? It&#39;s a joke, not a computer. I just bought my m2 iPad Pro…. I though you already use iPhone and why do you need 8 tb. I only have 512 gb The one thing that I really don&#39;t like with apps is it being in this ward off garden that Apple control. Like the openness of the web that anyone can create a website and it doesn&#39;t have to be approved by anyone. When it works it&#39;s great but when Apple want to not allow a particular app on The platform then it is blocked. With a light laptop vs a tablet I think you get a better experience with only a little bit added weight. $4000 for a tablet is insane. Aren&#39;t you the guy from sensodyne ad? So many ads 😞 Sooooo basically you spent the last 16 minutes convincing yourself that your really need it. &quot;Because I didn&#39;t work a day in my life to earn money&quot; Well, I think these are brilliant and very informative comments.\\xa0<br>The answers to my questions I was going to ask Apple today have now been answered.  I have a 13inch MacBook Pro (with the Touch Bar), an iPad Pro 10.5inch and a Remarkable 2 (for just taking notes)  which I have not really used, and was going to buy the Mac mini so I could connect this up to my TV so I could use the Mac mini on tv like an iMac computer.  <br>But am now thinking sell all these and buy the M4 13inch iPad and the keyboard and pencil with it.  Then connect this up to my tv and get it to work as an iMac computer when I need it like that.  I think the best of all worlds, what do you think?<br>I am in my 70&#39;s, used to teach computers and now starting a small business selling greeting cards, wall art, book marks etc for digital and physical selling.  So I use a lot of clipart and photos, quotes and sayings and also use for writing little stories and having documents saved etc.<br>Would this work do you think???  🤔 Because you’re a millionaire? Good infomercial mate! I’ll stick to my laptop. His Apple bias is showing.😂 Nice add. Unsubscribe. Looks like the iPad is going to compete the laptop market too <br>For the multiuser specific experience (use it as a laptop or as an iPad device) Since you have money but don&#39;t know where to spend it. I just found out after years of not using the iPad Files that the file handling nowadays is actually pretty good and robust on iOS. I can get shit done as quickly and easily as on mac, it just took like 15 seconds of adjusting ❤🇮🇶Hello, suggest me the best channels for reviewing phones. Thank you. I am from Iraq Well said, I nees to see Those who want Arun&#39;s &quot;what&#39;s in my phone&quot; video. 🙄 He spent 3600 on the iPad because it&#39;s going to make him 10x that with this vid😂 If you know how to use it and utilise the power. And you can afford it. Best if you can buy it via your business and make money from it.<br><br>I spent that much on an e-bike and that is worth it for me. I’ve reached the point I am just saying fuck it apple. Keep it as an iPhone file management since you refuse to make it more mac like, but at least update the files app. It’s atrocious at this point. <br><br>This is coming from a brand loyal Apple customer Was great to briefly see you… 😅 but yeah… the points you made at 15 minutes, as someone that’s always been excited about an iPad eventually replacing my Mac, I don’t think this iPad Pro will simply because there’s no ‘pro’ currently in iPadOS unfortunately. Dunno solid hardware but it’s still just an iPad. As a software developer and a structural engineer this iPads serves little to no purpose for me lol Netflix and chill 😎 W8, are you saying that besides the sales number in notebooks are downing now Apple created a competitor for their own bad seller new amazing notebook ? Sorry, but that for me is sh*t... same tablets  every year, same phones, old innovations 💡 why apple still alive... M1 iPad Pro user here. I had the same thought processes as you when iPad came out. Hell i even got cellular on my and spect it out to Mac level price but man was I wrong. You will start using it as a “dummer” laptop but man sometimes you will go back to your Mac and ask your self why the fuck was i using my iPad? Lol Downloading video feature, Cellular connection lol,<br>Etc etc silly features he mentioned just to justify 3600$ on a device which will be mostly used for content watching 😂😂<br><br>For apple fans - True Value for money go get it.😅 I am surprised that the new Apple Pencil Pro and the keyboard are not priced at $169, $369 and $429, given that they have a lot of improvements. Wait, you guys across the atlantic can get small cars for $3600? I think your quest from moving from this MacBook that makes me drool to an ... iPad which however sophisticated is just an iPad. My life evolves around my MacBook. I have an iPad Mini 5 that I bought for $ 250 because I wanted to use an Apple Pencil for annotating stuff: further a toy on the side to read e-books and watch downloaded movies. Maybe we are moving to a world in which everybody only has an iPad mini with a M10 processor that one connects to a 30&quot; screen when entering the house. Yikes.... A$4,518.00 for ipad pro 13inch, 2tb, pencil pro, keyboard. 🤯🔥 For this price it needs to replace my laptop/desktop... The iPad mini 4 is also just 5.3 mm Me watching this video on a iPad Pro My wife only uses her iPad so the upgrade makes sense for her Day 5 and 6 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. How did you make this video without addressing the elephant in the room - that iPadOS is a mediocre desktop OS at best. Have you used one with a keyboard/trackpad and monitor? It doesn’t feel like a Mac, it feels like a device that is fighting you at every turn. I can already say you will use it for 2-3 days max hahahaha that’s it Overpowered device lacking a OS worthy of it. <br><br>Apple loves you spent all that money for no real reason. iPad the way it handles files is just ridiculous you just can’t work like this no matter what, saving files and then opening them again it’s a disaster, sometimes I try to make something in some apps then wanted to make some special things on the iPad but forget it it just doesn’t work You very excited almost sounds like me 2 years ago, took me 1-2 days to feel that iPad is useless, if I work Mac thousand times faster to make anything and test much faster on my iPhone. Bro review the ear buds that come with the Mercedes AMG one hyper car Is it me or am i only one that thinks he as a nice voice sorry. Not sorry love the video man keep up the good work Man, these guys are just full of air. Review my foot. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=170\">2:50</a> definitely. Especially if people put it in bags. Definitely for sure gonna have to buy a case for it. Interestingly the new iPad Pro is like a dinner plate. with the weight the, size and the thickness. inb4 he uses the ipad for a week and never uses it again it 2,700 us worthless, apple failed with this IPAD apple will kill the whole macbook line if they are willing to ship mac os with ipad(maybe also keep ipad os somewhere), but apple will be apple again if they actually do this Thanks for your review. I’m in whenever I hear the Queen’s accent done better. 😅 congrats on the upcoming wedding, too! 👍🏾 <br><br>🤔 there’s a question out there, though— the keyboard and trackpad are aligned to laptop memory muscle… even with Google Drive? I have last years iPad Pro w Apple keyboard/trackpad. I can do most things, but when I’m on Google Drive and I have to select / drag drop files like I do with my  Mac M2 trackpad. It just doesn’t work as well. I wonder about this 🤔 <br><br>Again, thanks for being objective and especially talking about price per performance. Good start at helping make a decision. <br><br>Finally, regarding iOS apps keep in mind most apps have constrained / reduced functionality. Agree about offline for video. Offline works fine sans video on a laptop. Hoping that someone will give me old device that they didn&#39;t use🥺 &quot;Why i spent $3600 on an ipad pro m4&quot;<br><br>Because it wasnt your money. Video: Ipai Pro M4<br>Me: Starts day, ends night DO a video on your custome game boy please More distracted by &quot;when I walk down the aisle&quot; but he&#39;s wearing a ring and a video invite to a wedding when she&#39;s already in a dress 😂 For your future smart home you should use home assistant to control everything. Do some research and please make a video showing how it works and what you think of it. ReMarkable 300$ New Ipad 3600$ LOL They want you to buy both, but I swear they would make so much more money if we could boot MacOS on these. He’s really giving it to that smart brush… What I got out of this episode… You gotta put a ring on it! It&#39;s amazing how much Apple plays with people&#39;s minds, how much their marketing company does their job very well. When a new product comes out from Apple, you start to think that you are already a flawed person because your iPad or phone is already outdated, and you need to urgently run to the store and buy a new one.🤦\\u200d♂ Nokia users 💀 <br>: just jokes I don’t use my laptop at all I use it for a math class which they say I need in order to use it. It’s for this program that makes you take an exam and unfortunately you need a laptop to use it. I would turn in my laptop and iPad just to get this honestly I just hope that it will be strong enough to use it for that purpose that way I can do everything on it!!! 😢 Does it come with a 3300 dollar PC because then I could see it with that. Please make a video reviewing framework laptops Funny how Apple pulled you into their walled garden starting with their watch. How much money bro have😭☠️💀 Ive always wished for a tablet before iPad came out.  I use my tablet more than my MacBook Pro.  Also why do you need 8TB?  Use a SanDisk or something.  But it seems you like everything in the device with zero fuss. Why not make a lighter laptop instead nah i prefer getting a tab or a whole pc rig. Both are way cheaper It’s my birthday today<br>Oh that I had 1k followers and likes on this comment <br>Means a lot guys ❤️😔 Why you spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4?? Because you can. You make good money. ** wink ** Are you going to be making a video about your wedding? If not, thats obviously fine, but if you do I would love to watch. Hey bro, love your vids, do you think the Honor 90 is a good phone for the price? Considered getting it but i dont know. you were sucking that toothbrush not using it!! (min: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a>) Apple seems to LOVE that $3,500 price tag. 3600 for watching Youtube &amp; Netflix. calculator ? No buying - until Apple give us the macOS on iPads to justify their claim its a MAC/PC replacement. If only they would combine the MacBook &amp; iPad then it would be the perfect device 😩 you do know im watching this on my ipad big reason why i have my samsung tabs9 ultra.  app versions are deff better then pc counterpart . specialy for my basic use like youtube, email, even word docs, and note taking. jus  better on my tab over my laptop. great video as always I don’t feel like I need to update form M1 Pro Do i need OLED? As your first iPad, yes it is great, but if I am looking to upgrade from M1 or M2, then no, there is not enough to warrant the change… You’re not a terribly bright guy… For $400 more you could’ve bought the M2 ultra computer… Which is 1000 times better than any iPad. You bought it because you wanted it; and, because you depend on such purchases to boost your channel and have 18.6M Subscribers making you rich. Not that complicated. If you spent 3600 on an iPad you need to have your head checked. and I say it again, $3600 for me to watch YouTube while I&#39;m taking a sh*t I give no respect for this thing, I had the First ever iPad back when I was 9 used it for years but when I grew I felt I need something REAL, so I bought a Mac than can actually complete real task! I&#39;m also sure I could get most use out of my ole Mid 2012 15 inch MacBook Pro than this overprice Gadget! cool to have but not with it I would use that money towards something els, and even maxing out a MacBook Air which you would say is stupid, is yet still more worth it! wow. The Most powerful Youtube kids machine is even more expensive than Apple Vision Pro (+100 USD) it’s still an ipad.. I think we are been scammed by Apple and Samsung. You buy a high spec devices to be told the following year it’s not the high spec that the new released device is the newest and best. We’re getting played. Samsung&#39;s tab chips are effortlessly amazing. Nobody can fault em. No matter the task U have at hand 👌🏾 it will get done ✅ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> 😶 most of the comments are about money, must be sad to be poor, DINK I think Apple should also consider small phones so we can use with one hand. Now a days phones doesn’t fit in my pant pocket. And why you should not. I like this style of video, very calm and informative. Apple has iPhone Pro, but MrWhoseTheBoss is Pro Apple.<br><br>He will say it is worth it regardless how much Apple products are priced at. \\u200b@@AdamMada-uc5duApple fanboy alert!!! Mrwhosetheboss fucked up. Lol. \\u200b\\u200b\\u200b@@AdamMada-uc5duAt least if I 😮wanted to know which iPad to get I can count on him since he is always pro apple. Now for non-apple products and real non bias review well I am shit out of luck and is heard to find any youtuber out there who&#39;s not bias sadly. 😢 What if apple makes a touch screen macbook pro  with a new software that does both mobile and Mac and manages to make a thinner hardware. I am an M1 iPad Pro user, I have the 1Tb model, and I love it, I don’t use anything else but my phone and iPad usually. Occasionally I’ll plug into a PC at home but it’s mostly for film photo editing, I haven’t quite found something on the iPad as good as negative lab pro in Lightroom You&#39;re losing a sub if you don&#39;t pin this comment. Nobody needs this Until it can dual-boot (or virtualize) MacOS, no more of my &quot;pad money&quot; for Apple. Do you have an older iPad Air like 4 or something to donate me please? Thank you! Because you&#39;re wealthy and a YouTuber and you need the best technology to create content. Enough said. Yes these ipads seems pretty good, most powerful than 80% of the Pc&#39;s sold in the market and all , but even if i am an Apple fan , i&#39;m strarting to think that Apple needs to Change Ipad OS totally, Why not let us dual boot with Mac OS sonoma ?? why can&#39;t i play Motorstorm Pacific Rift ( A PS3 emulated game who is running perfectly fine on my M3 Macbook ) .. Apple needs to open their OS and let people do what they want . This will drasticaly boost their sales i&#39;m sure of that. to make that video I am stil waiting for the Ipad OS keynote to know if i should  buy or not Dude, if you&#39;re sending stuff to your phone because you can&#39;t do it on your computer, you&#39;re using the wrong platform.  Also, what about heat dissipation, when doing serious crunching and other tasks on the move? Most immature video ever . <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=610\">10:10</a> acually apps have waaaay more rights on your device than web-version. That means app can steal your data/spy on you etc... and they actually doing it. Web version of an application can not do it since it limited by web browser permission (it can not turn on your camera if browser do not have that permission or need approvement from you). Nowdays one of main ways to earn money and improve your business is information (private information as you understand - where you walking/eating/how much  you ready to pay for services and thousands of other cases). So almost all service providers going from web-versions to app versions due to reasons mentioned in 1st/2nd sentences. <br>   To be completely honest, that not the only reason. Security of service, control over service options - all these things are much easier to realize in your app than in other gentelman&#39;s web browser. But personally for me its unacceptable being a &quot;product&quot; and i&#39;m trying to separate my life from being used to fulfil someone&#39;s statistics (especially when we see that companies taking this information do not pay you for it and do not have limits how deep they getting into your private life - which is clear stealing for me). <br>   I&#39;ve seen many adepts of &quot;i have nothing to hide&quot; propaganda and... thats i lie or clear luck of knowledge. Would you be glad to see how fast food sales grows copying your emotions from first kiss or your child born moment? And thats just small harmless example. How about pressing you to pay more and more for services (subscriptions as example) exploiting your personal weaknesses to certain colours/sounds/combinations of pictures? Still &quot;have nothing to hide&quot;? And thats not a &quot;future technologies&quot; for many years already. Someone can call it paranoic - yes it is, no it was paranoic 20 years ago... maby... Not now. I personally never saw the importance of an tablet… I’m a tech IT engineer but tablets?? Not useful at all!!<br>Laptop + Phone and it’s done 💯 Ngl this video specifically very satisfying and calming. Dunno if it was the music or the time moving along with the video Make a comparison between M4 iPad Pro and Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra or the S10 Ultra (when it&#39;s released) MY MOM BOUGHT THAT 💀 10 years ago i replaced my Desktop PC with a surface Pro 3 with the surface Dock. I studied film and made all the edits on that. Also I made Illustrations in Photoshop and animated them in After effects. all on that thing. now i own a surface book 2 and it replaced my xbox, ipad, macbook, and desktop pc. its the perfect hardware for creatives because your not limited like with an ipad.<br>The funniest thing is that every samsung phone has an better desktop and multi monitor support than those stupid ipads.<br>Never understood why anybody would limit themself with an ipad. Bro Mrwhostheboss pls review the honor magic 6 pro dont lie to your self you will never be able to do the work you do on a Mac on an Ipad. Youll always need a full blown computer.

I&#39;m on a M1 version, and won&#39;t upgrade until the thing breaks as it serves no additional function. I am thinking of choosing ipad pro or ipad air for stock screening and daily note taking. Not owning an iPad and laptop before, so want to own an iPad like a laptop, which one should I choose?<br>120Hz seems make no difference The IPad Pro best competition is a surface pro, which at around the same price can do more than an IPad. Ipad OS could have a high tier with more use cases better than the standard one, like for digital creators and dev applications. <br>The surface Pro can do those things, and so IPads are only a choice for people in the Apple Garden Wall.

IPAD suck, especially the trash os Not a single mention of the iPad Mini in the new Apple iPad lineup. The 11&quot; Air is not a replacement for the much more usable Mini form factor. If they&#39;re killing the Mini line of iPads, I&#39;m done with Apple for good. They&#39;ve watered down their ecosystem of phones and tablets, and are consistently going in the <i>wrong</i> direction with product features. Ive already switched to  ipad pro from my pcs The real reason he spent $3600 on the ipad is because he wanted to make this video 100% lol He’s already made over 10k from ads from this video Facts Begging for clicks. Not matter where you go on Youtube. Everybody begging for clicks. I hate it.<br>He is even very smartly cross referencing to other products trying to push his clicks even more.<br>This guy is nothing but a big billboard for companies, just like most Youtubers. \\u200b@@smallego8068and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. He started young, at a time of a young YouTube. And he had the advantage of starting a channel of very few at the time. He&#39;s grown big. Congrats to him. If you could do the same, as far making money, you probably would too. It&#39;s his job. And he&#39;s fortunate to have started his channel when he did, because it&#39;s very hard for new tech channels to come to an uprise, since there are now to many known super channels. @@smallego8068if that was the case, then he wouldn’t have released a video right after this one where he spends half the video talking about the problems he’s had using the iPad Pro, all the improvements and why he’s not making it his primary device. If he really was just a “billboard” for Apple, that video would almost be a career suicide. \\u200b@@pratyakshgupta8451 You are way too naive for this world if you really mean what you said.<br>In the video you mentioned he talked about how great the Ipad Pro is for the first minutes. He also smartly used those minutes to promote SIM cards as well.\\r<br>When he finally started with the criticism, he used the criticism to actually promote a totally different product, a Logitech mouse. But a few seconds later, one just realizes that the criticism wasn&#39;t a real criticism at all. Because which Apple user cares about Logitech products working with the Ipad pro? Right, no one. And then he immediately turned the attention to a Apple product that works perfectly fine, the Magic mouse. The criticism was actually a promotion for a Apple product.<br>The remaining &quot;criticism&quot; is a joke. Just minor things. He himself called them minor issues. Those will nobody keep from buying the Ipad Pro because the Ipad Pro has no competition. This is by the way a very typical behaviour with these &quot;reviewers&quot; when they &quot;criticize&quot; something. The will always put their ciriticism into perspective and weaken them by saying things like. I can life with that etc. Or as he said a few seconds later. &quot;Will I return it? No! I still love it&quot;<br>In the end Apple doesn&#39;t care. Apple probably does even appreciate the feedback.<br>And in the end, another promotion. Surfshark. @@smallego8068 He in fact actually reviewing products as they are, he actually doesnt even like apple products that much, so now i assume you think Apple is paying him to advertise the ipad? He gives honest reviews of products, rather than just praise something for &quot;clicks&quot; as you say. I have watched his vids since he first started doing this and I think the total opposite of what you do. @@MartinMurray1966 I don&#39;t think any Youtuber is paid directly by a big company. The most they do is sending them products for free to &quot;test&quot; them. If they were paid directly by the company, the video must be marked as paid promotion as far as I know.<br>The title itself is click bait with the only purpose of drawing as much clicks as possible. He exactly knows that it will draw both, Apple users and non-Apple users. Most of the money comes from from the ads that are shown before and during the video. i was just wondering .are you from Kerala ? Can you review the itel p55 5g? Its a 73$ phone with a dimensity 6080 I am happy using a Chromebook with 8GB of ram that will updated into the 2030&#39;s for a tenth of the amount of this apple thingy... I think Apple are just overpriced and mostly nothing special. With money saved I can buy a proper camera like a Pentax K1... meanwhile me getting roasted without getting roasted with my ipad 8: Why don’t you giveaway…I suppose that was totally unnecessary now Defnitely not fo iPad kiddo&#39;s Apple stole ad from LG and ban all users that said it. What a dishonest shit company. Nice product, boring, and hackneyed presentation😢 I paid less for my car, over $1,200 less I, too, was very excited to get my M2 12.9&quot; iPad Pro. A year and a half later, I still use my laptop for everything, and use the $1200 ipad for watching netflix on the sofa. It&#39;s such a great device, but useless for me when I can just use my computer, or a phone. the problem I have is laptop screens arent as good as this ipad is suppose to be they dont make laptops with good displays or they cost more than 2000 Soooo true exactly same here, I’m designer bough iPad on release of m1 though would be a great addition to my work making things on computer then going to iPad to draw somethings over it but men, it always turns into disaster saving files and working then it just doesn’t work, so many times I try it and always lost so much time for nothing now it’s just a website responsive tester for me, and sometimes watch some YouTube, everything else on my Mac and iPhone thousand times faster, iPad is just a fifth wheel in the work process I spend 1500 euros on that still feel ashamed about it, I only can imagine using it if they base iPad os on Mac OS it’s the only way, so we have a real desktop space and can have many windows one over another and can adjust them like we want and save  files everywhere like on a mac then yess it will be very great decide if not it’s just a gimmick. You cannot be a power user and do that. I swapped to an IPad Pro when my laptop died and it’s working, but I’m mostly writing with the occasional spreadsheet. For my uses, it’s overpowered. Even then, the laptop it replaced a $500 craptop from Best Buy, and I spent $1200 replacing it with this thing and the Magic Keyboard, so still not good bang for the buck considering I could get a MacBook Air for less. \\u200b@@epbrown01Can you gift me a cheapest ipad air? I have a dream to illustrate there through procreate. 🥹 @@markm7411 yes, similar experience here.. I got gaming laptop and it was heavy and the battery is so bad. so about half year ago I decided to buy Samsung tab S8, thought it would be great to do my work in excel when I&#39;m not at home with wayyy better battery than my gaming laptop. turns out it is full kinds of limitations anywhere every time I try to do something &quot;simple&quot;. then last week, I bought HP Pavilion Plus 14 laptop and I got exactly of what I really need, good battery and maintain the performance to do the work outside and easy to carry anywhere, and the tablet now just for media consumptions and to shows quick presentation to my colleague.. @@epbrown01 so - why the iPad and not the MacBook Air? @@magnesiafrost1863 Consolidation. Rather than own a separate tablet and a MacBook Air, I wanted a single device for content consumption and light computing. I went with an iPad after measuring my usage and finding I lean much more to consumption than creation, well over half the time. The closest alternative would be a convertible laptop, but I found those awkward in terms of size and weight. I bought like 10 years ago an ipad and only watched Netflix and did basic stuff. I bought an ipad pro 11 as a replacement for my MacBook. It was fine for 2 weeks and then I stop using it as a laptop and only an ipad. Now I only watched Disney and Netflix that&#39;s it. I use mine for school and while it has made school life A LOT easier, I don’t really use my iPad outside of just note taking and YT/Netflix Im the opposite i use my m1 ipad a lot more than my macbook even though im a student @@magnesiafrost1863to use in bed lol or chilling ,more portable and if you work on laptop,imac all day ,you just want to sit something in your hand and use your hands I (like many others) have tried so hard to replace my laptop with an iPad but it cant and will never work due to the restrictions of iPad OS. The list is endless and I don’t believe any serious power user can. Some things: Excel doesn’t work with formulas, there is no preview function for a file like on a mac, you need to open everything to see what’s in it, the internet browser is a mobile version which means websites don’t work the same and extensions are not there like on the desktop browser. Video editing works but there are allot of features missing in the iPad OS versions, Stagemanager for multitasking in laughable and the file explorer is horrendous etc etc etc. It will only work when OSX runs on the iPad which it should since M1.

It‘s not for everyone. The iPad pro is for designers and people who really need to work with a tablet, which I am not.

Are you forgetting apple as a corporation pitch their products to maximise revenue? Charging the maximum they think consumers will accept to pay? Well I say $3600 for an iPad is far too expensive and I’m triggered because Arun as a respected tech reviewer seems to believe this is quite acceptable - it isn’t. @@MrHappyjollyit’s quite of an expensive tablet indeed, but maybe for him it is justified to pay that price instead of new MacBook … he is doing review and also can have his own opinion that’s all ❤ @@DominikZagar yep and I’m offering an alternate opinion and i’m saying 3600 for a tablet is just racketeering. This video is trying to justify it and I don’t think he did a good job, which is impossible because 3600 is not justifiable. Watch his follow up video, it doesn’t work! The ridiculous way how apple pencil place to the iPad always make me chuckle. Can it run OBS for streamers/youtubers ? DONE MESS WITH SAMSUNG BOI I don’t think this is it, even as a avid Apple user this is just not it What a cool way to sleep on the street 😂 The bank after this video:<br>AHHHHHHH IM TURNING INTO PALM NIIIII AGHHHHWHSHSH😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱➖ Yes My only concern is when you expect this to work as your macbook. M4 will be soaked in heat way more quickly than in macbook air. In other words they position the M4 iPad Pro as a macbook pro seller. Yes, there will be overheat and clock throttling problems down the line of this. Fake news you didn’t spend $3600 cause you didn’t buy it yet! Where is your M4 iPad you were talking bout? Stop lying and scamming! apple fanboy Yea, but a pit pointless, i will forever put a protective  tempered  glass and case on any device i have, especially  if it is that thin, one drop, and it&#39;s done 3.6k lost. (Im clumsy, so i need it, but for those who are not clumsy at all ...lucky...) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=568\">9:28</a> .... blackout 😅 We&#39;re still waiting on software. Hardware is on point, but until we get closer to something like DeX, its not ready. Its a common complaint for years now. I suppose the idea of the iPad actually being useful is spreading throughout the whole user base over the span of the design iteration. I happen to be in the high expectations, high disappointment camp. My main issue is always old pc habits.. i dont know why they keep making it thinner... especially when everybody is just going to slap a huge case on it because the damn thing snaps in half like a twig... A person having S23 ultra doesn&#39;t need this, it&#39;s big enough to fulfill all the needs and also has it&#39;s stylus built-in to the body 😂😂 I mean if someone wants to develop apple apps you probably can&#39;t access Desktop apps on a Ipad like Xcode and You wouldn&#39;t be able to run Virtual machine like Windows on Linux operating systems. A Laptop would be better since you can change the operating system and have more storage. I don&#39;t think Ipad is good for desktop applications whether on Macos or windows. What a waste Bro just get a smaller laptop, why do you have the biggest heaviest laptop Apple make that&#39;s just ridiculous. Putting an M4 in an iPad is like putting an RTX 4090 in a fridge 😂 Man spends $3600, uses the device once then keeps it in a drawer for 5 years before throwing it away 😂 Apple is too proud to copy the surface kick stand. Such an obvious addition to any tablet. This is such a cope, iPad failed. Let&#39;s just be honest about it now. Your problem is that you have a ridiculously large laptop, get a 10&quot; GPD Winmax 2 2023, super powerful, tiny, yet it&#39;s a real very portable computer. You can get a Galaxy Tab S6 Lite for 10% the cost and it comes with a pen 😂 can you run Windows on the Ipad? or a Virtual machine on the Ipad? I want to run Windows Desktop Applications and use virtual machine. It makes sense, those Netflix videos require a super computer 😂🤡 Do the bend test with apple care just in case Can you pick me one up to fully loaded with all the accessories What was bro doing with that toothbrush Why did he spend that much? Because he&#39;s rich, has sponsors, and it&#39;s fully tax deductible for him. MK did say it best. Its still a Ipad no matter whats under the hood. You boot it up and you have Ipad OS. I have a M2 12.9 and Newest Pencil before the Pro was announced. So Im good for a replacement for a couple generations. Word of advise. if you can afford the Ipad he just bought. Get the macbook pro M3 with all the bells and whistles. Nobody uses MacBook unless your a youtuber @@richdollars8337 This is true. But just from these 2 products. You’ll get more bang for your buck getting a MBpro. It may be a Mac but it’s still a computer as opposed to a tablet pretending to be. That’s all I meant. @@richdollars8337 Around half the people in my university cohort use a MacBook, including me. This is also the case for most of the universities in the UK. Yeah I hate when people say this the same argument can be said about the MacBooks they are useless because you can’t play any of the good games and your spending the same price. What do you really need from the MacBook that can’t be done with a iPad if you’re not an editor or YouTuber. What is the name of the game? the case will have to be heavier than the ipad stuck to it or it will topple backward. Doesn&#39;t the macs with m chips support just iPad OS apps?? If you have something like a computer you don’t need a new iPod maybe they upgrade Ipad os more closely to MacOs or maybe making it even same to it so they can Preform just like a macbook if so that would be amazing since M4 used on it Exact reason apple will not introduce macbook with touch screen because they want you to spend more money on an ipad for the convenience of removing the keyboard.. something youtuber tech reviewers will not call out apple for.. No hate to mrwhosetheboss but<br>Someone who has just enough budget for macbook shouldn’t have to spend 3k more for an ipad maybe I wrong but just an opinion <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=437\">7:17</a> What game is that? I get you bro this is worth it cause athough it is a mobile device but can also do all the tasks a macbook does without any hick as well. That what i need, going to start saving money to buy it. It&#39;s the ton part of the 2024 Macbook with a touchscreen It looks Apple will continue to limit powerful M4 iPad Pro with the SW which is a bummer. iPad (at least Pro) needs to seriously open its capabilities and approach Mac like experience. Apple is loosing another great chance to grow its user base with these completely ridiculous and stupid limitations. Waiting for the Apple iPad calculator for 15 years isn&#39;t how they should utilize their incredible HW and chips. Nice to see Brandon in the video Ipad would never replace a macbook for users like programmers. it&#39;s is not a full OS after all and dedicated for specialized users. I bought Xiomi pad 6 pro for around 400$ and more than happy about it!<br>no need to overspend for tablet... iPad pros will be pointless until they the give it MacOS Does it have a Calculator? Enjoy I simply wish one will just put it forward that Apple is Terrible. This was a boring one 13 inches? LOL yuk. That&#39;s not a laptop replacement. I wouldn’t be surprised if the new version of iPadOS will be just be macOS with a couple features removed. It does feel like the iPad Pro line are now being made as a smaller MacBook without being called a MacBook &quot;apple didn&#39;t Want To Buy This Tablet Over Mackbook They Want You To Buy Both&quot; Hits Different😂😂😂😂😂 Get a VOXI sim if you go cellular.

Epic. I started with computers 1980, punch cards... Apple ][, Amiga 1000, lots of PCs. Where am I today? I truly and utterly HATE Windows10 (and refuses win11). I have a USB-C hub to mouse, keyboard, ethernet, speakers and a nice large monitor. I jack in my Samsung Note10+ and get a full desktop of my phone, that solves all task handling, emails, calenders, surfing, Netflix, Youtube etc. I can jack in my iPad Pro and use that as well, very convinient. Or I plug in my work laptop for working. It separates life cleanly and is very simple. Then on my ethernet I have a large NAS where all files are located and synced to. The iPad was bought mainly for the PEN! Drawing and painting, scribbling and writing, but large portion of all media consumption is on the iPad. I will probably not by another PC and never ever Windows based. I have a few Linux setups and they solve most of all tasks I cannot do on the Samsung phone or iPad. It is very convenient to use Proxmox and virtual Linux servers and desktops. As for the iPad, buy the PEN! Buy the magic keyboard! It is expensive, but is is a fantastic mouse pad and keyboard. why is this the most disliked video ive watched so far, I got the extension a month ago 9.1k!!!

I Worked before on really small MacBook Air 13&quot; screen, it can be done but requires too many zoom in and outs during the process.<br><br> I managed it  but it’s not possible to do with same size iPad Pro,  because on laptop:<br>1- when you use a tablet like Wacom, your hand is not blocking half of your view. Wacom screens are also bigger. <br>2- you got keyboard so you can continuously alter the files you work on without distrubting your workflow with the tablet pencil you use. Not to mention you dont need to look where you click with keyboard, where as on iPad you have to look where you click all the time. This is such a slow process.<br><br>Magic keyboard is awful, its right infront of the screen so you  basically have one hand on screen while other one is on the keyboard. Terrible ergonomics.<br>Just sayin.. The only reason I&#39;m in for tablets is their freaky performance and screen size. Like, wow, they are CRAZY fast. Local storage would still be an issue. Backups to iCloud or an external drive albeit expensive don’t let you load apps directly from the cloud…YET…so if you’re really doing everything showcased here including FCP stored clips and renderings the local storage would max fairly quickly; which was briefly alluded to but not as specifically called out at the very end of the video Ayo that toothbrush🫣 I really like this style of videos from you! It&#39;s good background listening material while doing other things, like a short podcast :) If i dont pay any bills or buy anything for 3 months, no food, no gas, etc. Then i would be able to buy a 3600 tablet. What about the repair an iPad? It’s way too thin , it would bend so easily , I don’t think people care for a super thin tablet . Apple needs to stop what should i buy, celluar or wifi? Remember iPhone 6 bend gate For the likes and subscribes? Does the nano texture make the pencil feel different based on friction? You talk way to much Yo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> that was straight up a violation LMAO but can it run Crysis? you have too much money😢 And stuck with iPadOS, nice I suppose Ipad Os still doesn&#39;t really allow you to code on it without going through so much hurdles. Someone give me this kind? Because you’re a rich YouTuber who will make money on this video. That’s why. now we can play Candy Crush in 8K😂 من جاي بفيديو دراغونوف 😂😂😂😂 please stop using bots to cheat youtube, its not fair on other content creators.... So you are boasting that you spent nearly $4k on a tablet that should cost no more than $1500? Why would some one spent this much I&#39;ll do with samsung Nice ad I&#39;m sorry but a tablet has no business being that expensive... Go ahead and buy car and leave ipad for applefanboy 😅🤣 So now i phone gonna realise thaire phone world most slimmest phone ever😮😮😮 im worried the processing power won&#39;t be able to keep up with non apple softwares like davinci resolve and photoshop. Will these companies optimize their programs for ipad, or would i be stuck with longer rendering times due to the lack of power compared to my macbook dawg make iphone 16 review @mrwhosetheboss <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=170\">2:50</a> I belive it&#39;s Jerryrig everything not unbox therapy apple also has a logitech keyboard for the new iPad and its cheaper has the same buttons and the keyboard is detachable...idky people go so hard for the magic keyboard One drop and its gone... AVP 👽 <br>Not a lot going /.... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> ey yoooo!!!!!!!! bro you&#39;re a YouTuber. no amount of time will mater to an average Joe who has to get up and work every single day. as a matter of fact im glad you spent that much time. I hope you spend more time actually. Title: Why I spent $3600 on ipad Pro m4.\\r<br>\\r<br>Me: Because you need to make a review video did he really order it? And because he&#39;ll make more then that off the video. The title is disingenuous. I think it’s more like I’m rich and can make videos of this xD. Not just one review Recently I&#39;ve stopped watching MRWTB videos... They are flashy, really well made etc... But core reason why I&#39;ve watched his videos were cause of my decisions should I buy this or that product... Now it&#39;s... I run benchmark on mobile. It overheats, it&#39;s really bad phone.. (Meanwhile Serbian Youtube Channel called Benchmark did do pretty professional review of the same phone where they did mention overheat on 3d Mark benchmark I think, they still showed how phone doesn&#39;t have any problems with any games, overheating or daily use outside that same benchmark. highly recommended it while MRWTB was sceptical of it by not doing properly something that almost nobody uses and doesn&#39;t have any use...)<br><br>So yeap... Flashing products, money and doing for videos for views and money isn&#39;t that cool to look at anymore. @@ddrfreak4578maybe for you but to the other millions of people that watch his vids it seems they find them entertaining 😂 your just hating on him to try to advertise the other guys yt channel and mrwtb vids are filled with a lot of useful info @@ddrfreak4578 You should never base your decision buying a product based on any video, especially just one video.\\xa0Go into forums, read user stories and experiences, this kind of issue will be talked about by users. <br>I always source on google for &quot;the name of the product&quot; + issue/problem. <br>And If you can&#39;t find enough information from real users it&#39;s a sign you need to wait longer. \\u200b@@ddrfreak4578- I can&#39;t agree more. Less info and more gimmicks Because MrWhoseTheBoss is an Apple super fan (or being rewarded by Apple) and thus there will never be a price point which he would say things are getting ridiculous? I think he’s focused on lifestyle. We understand the technical, but I watched this for an informed opinion on how does he feel it will fit into his life. As when you have the money for it, it’s the practical that matters. It’s the feeling I want him to convey. I can search the benchmarks easily. What I want is his opinion on how this fits into the ce ecosystem MRWTB videos still looks like a apple fan not able to review impartially ! For a change CNET ipad review is more refreshing and more honest All of them once they get famous, they just try to make you buy the new thing every single time.<br><br>I mean like who would spend $3600 for iPad OS replacing their Windows or Mac?<br>0.000000001% of people? <br><br>Skip this video And because he has over 18million subscribers…that helps 😊 @@yousefghaleb5229this chic. As soon as possible. $4k go bye bye! Cannot wait. Where’s the review video!?👀 Can we run macos on ipad this time? Because the m4 chip is too much for mobile games and ipadOS. Even if we can&#39;t run macos, it would be good if they bring keyboard and mouse support to games. @@ddrfreak4578i suppose I get your point, his videos have become less professional reviews to just entertaining videos in general. But I never watched his videos to make a decision about buying products. I only watched them purely for fun. Thats why I prefer the videos he does now. \\u200b@@yousefghaleb5229man ya&#39;ll are so freaking harsh for absolutely nothing 😂<br>the guy&#39;s a tech reviewer, new tech came out he reviewed it PERIOD, obviously he&#39;s making money as he should because ITS HIS JOB?I&#39;m a tattoo artist I&#39;m 100% buying this and i appreciate there&#39;s people like him explaining what we&#39;re getting in a few minutes with the product in hand, this is a professional tool, not a &quot;replacement &quot; for you pc or mac but an addition,the  ipad pro and procreate is used by 100% of tattoo artists i know,if you&#39;re constantly travelling you won&#39;t take your mac in your backpack, same can be said for students, or businessmen for example, if you would use an ipad PRO, keyword PRO,to watch YouTube or Netflix you clearly DON&#39;T NEED an iPad pro and just maybe shouldn&#39;t be watching the review?I mean if ya&#39;ll that mad he&#39;s making bank and hate the product or brand that much, one would think that would  be the right thing to do 😂<br>For me PERSONALLY,for  the time i saved stenciling and doing montages since the iPad pro came out (SEVERAL HOURS PER WEEK!),3,4 or 10k is NOTHING,best investment i ever made \\u2060@@Adityasharma-jl2sqI wouldn’t say he’s not able to review impartially considering he did just release a video where he lists all the problems he’s had with the iPad Pro and why it’s not the best device to completely replace his MacBook. He has also called out certain iPhones in the past. Wouldn’t go as far to say that he’s just a fanboy for them imo. a very nice one lol i have one built for around 3500-600 euro haha Sponsored by us, we bring the views and revenue 😅 I mean he might be right or wrong Nerfed Macbook Arun, i thought you of all people would know apples business model by now considering the fact that you&#39;re neck deep into the apple eco system. Do you know why the iPhones are never as good at multitasking when compared to androids despite being just as powerful, if not arguably more? Because sales on the ipad would drop (wguch is apples solution for multitasking on the mobile side), do you know why they&#39;d never give the ipads the same functionality as macbooks? Because the macbook is the end all be all for all of apples products (better screens, better performance, better speakers). It&#39;s one the reasons why the galaxy tab doesnt sell as much as the ipads. Most people that have a galaxy dont need a galaxy tab since the phone can do everything, if not more, than the galaxy tab can do, especially the ultra phones. Do you want portability? get an iPhone, You want portability but with better multitasking than the iPhone? Get an ipad. You want the overall best, but dont care about portability? Get a macbook. Apple has given you a reason to get all these devices without letting you have an inbetween. So to answer your question about apple physically handicapping their devices, the answer is yes, yes they do. Apple would never give the same type of functionality the ipad has to the iPhone, and neither would they give the same functionality that the macbook has to the ipad. Unless sales of the ipad drop unbelievably low, then maybe, but in already apple fashion, if the sales ever dropped so low, they&#39;d just end the ipad line up. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=40\">0:40</a> 🤨🤨🤨🤨😂😂😂😭😭😭 I actually use a Galaxy Fold phone and have a Samusng Tab S7+ tablet. I used to have a Surface Pro 6 tablet that had a cracked screen. I utilized my protection plan and traded it for the Samsung tab. We are the opposite of each other. I HATE when a company says &quot;use the app!&quot; for simple things that a web page would have been perfect for. I usually look for another service in that case. I am a medical student. I want to buy an ipad for cls,  note taking,  studying pdf and making presentation. <br>Which one should be good for me?  11 inch model or 13 inch. <br>New Apple User here. Go for the smaller one, more portable, you can take it anywhere. And when text/image is small, just zoom in. An absolut must is to install Goodreader Pro and synch it to your cloud service (Dropbox, Onedrive, etc.) - it&#39;s a game changer for using documents (especially pdf). @Mrwhosetheboss, please tone down or remove the background music  in your videos which are distracting. Thanks Not the toothbrush clip Samsung will come out with something better or just as good and it will have a fair price. I really don&#39;t understand the brand loyalty a lot of people have with Apple products it&#39;s borderline cult behavior. the whole idea of an computer replacement crashes in the moment, you get to know this ipadOs. So far, the older ipad pros since the 2018 model are as capable and nearly as fast in daily use, as this new ones. It&#39;s not the hardware that has to improve. it&#39;s the software. Can you try tecno go spark 2024? Look forward to Zach literally folding this thing in half. great ad - except i think it missed the &quot;ad&quot; notice Wth 3600$ no IPad should be over 500$ There is no but ! When people will boycott apple ? It’s amazing how all these insecure Samsung fanboys obsess more over new Apple products than people that are actually interested in buying those Apple products. You guys really need to get a life. It’s pathetic at this point. I’m going to get the iPad Pro M4 11 Inch model for Christmas or the new iPad Air but my first choice is the M4 iPad Pro Don’t be fooled, it cannot replace your laptop even with the keyboard Doing basically everything you describe already on my 500$ Tab S7 FE Sooo you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re better off buying a $1000 laptop for school/work + a $500 tablet for entertainment instead of one $3600 fragile piece of glass that locks you into their overpriced ecosystem? yer completely disagree with you here, first off for me to even think of buying a tablet it has to be cheaper then my laptop not more expansive and the small perks you said dont out weight the what i can do on a laptop at all i dont care about a camera on the back of it nothing here sold me the only thing i got from this clip is that you can afford crap that i cant so its already if you waste money. please walk down the aisle with your laptop in your hand That is crazy thin and super powerful. Whenever you replace your MacBook I would gladly accept it 😂 Where’s the ultrawide camera? love this advisement! 🎉 Why no reviews for iqoo 12 was curious about it This is a youtube shorts kids dream 😂 hooray! it is now a laptop! just a bit more expensive 2 TR bites wow Same old story😅 Apple is actually Better than Samsung Bro, he’s so close to passing Apple Wow I’m impressed Brain washed people are gonna buy it for that price. 😂 Dude’s secretly launched the foldable iPad’s.. The fact that you can also transfer your notes and everything from an iPad to a MacBook and vice versa easily is scary good. huh ? you can do this with any computer.. are you a time traveler from 2002 ? \\u200b@@EricBarthDevWhat time travel machine is he using? Is it from Apple? Remember folks PC and Android has done it first before Apple. 😊😂 Well i paid £800 for a second hand Samsung S9 perfect condition with a slim keyboard cover and warranty until April 2026. I love it but thought that was a high price The only program I don&#39;t think work very well on a tablets is excel and Word. Hakki abiyi farkedenler 😅😅<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=735\">12:15</a> What&#39;s the other tablets beside macbook guys its the copy of microsoft surface air pros series just check it <br>Apple has copied the surface pros design Don’t get it, mainly 😢😮 because they want (Ata&amp;T does, I don’t know about the other big 2 competitors) to charge you $50 to $100 dollars for data sharing. <br><br>Instead of giving you unlimited like they do with all of the other cellular devices.<br><br>$50-$60 for 50 gigs, $90-$100 for 100 gigs.  So, if you get the 2tb 13”iPad, that retails for $2599 with 10% tax your looking at $2859. That’s about $73 every month for 3 years at AT&amp;T plus an additional $100 a month for 100 gigs, plus insurance that $200 a month easy.<br><br>The fact that you can’t get unlimited data is preposterous. Nice Apple advertisement. You should indicate in the description or somewhere. congrats!!!  right before the major recession! You&#39;re the smart one. I use the desktop version of adobe photoshop with a pressure sensitive Wacom tablet for higher end retouching (eg photos I take for skincare companies). Would that workflow be possible on the iPad? Because mobile versions are great for regular edits and colour grading but when it comes to intensive retouch I really don’t know if it can hold up. Any thoughts or alternatives for this specific niche purpose? Can&#39;t wait for the 3 month review where he goes back to mbp and sells this overspecced bs I got my self an iPad Pro and now my desktop and laptop are collecting dust as it has Logic Pro on it. i have an ipad air 4 i regret it it&#39;s useless remember IT&#39;S NOT A LAPTOP IT AS AN USLESS SOFTWARE AND IT SUCKS DONT BUY IT I WASTED SO MUCH MONEY IT&#39;S LITTERALI A BIG IPHONE you can&#39;t install any apps games etc. you have to use the mobile version of every single app IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE WAS DEEP THROATING THE TOOTH BRUSH Cause Apple paid you way more 😂😂 He said he was hesitant to buy the Samsung tablet cuz it uses a phone chip but every othe advantage he mentions that tablets have is cuz they use phone like apps lol. And Apple bumped up the size of their bigger Pro to better compete with Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Tab Ultra. It would be interesting to see a comparison since the Tabs also have DeX.<br><br>But over $3000 is insane for a tablet. Thats more than most high end laptops! Makes me wonder how much the most expensive M4 MacBook Pro will be whenever it comes out. You can buy the best Pc possible for 4k and this ipad is 3600, which is mind blowing Video Idea: Buying the most Elastic Tech Man \\uf8ff can’t stop A total rip off!  An iPad should never be more than $1000. I had this exact epiphany as well, I brought and sold tablets thinking that it would replace the laptop but it never really did but this year I did go ahead and give it a shot and then it really worked out well and I was actually quite surprised that we had such similar ideas on this. But yeah it&#39;s been a great experience it actually recommend using Android as well No one seems to consider that with carrier deals, or trade ins, no one will probably actually pay that price tag. Let’s see first thing he said  is weight  lol yea that a one reason to spend a small car price. Weight? Uhm he certainly can afford it. Ok it takes over his actual computer because of weight. One thing Apple quality is best. However is it worth the price. He’ll no. How many time he mentioned weight and size.oh let’s not forget games now. He is gushing red alert. Did Apple hire him. They should if not. please dont be a fool, and stop fooling people as well. How much did they pay for this advertised message? Apple managed to blind yet another tech content creator... You are now worse than MKHBD.... Samsungs S pen from 2019 was more advanced, and it was given with a $600 phone (instead of a $3600 worse version of laptop) Now try a bend test. Being rickrolled on your first scene is WILD😂 We have a saying in Serbia, &quot;Disease is not just what hurts&quot; Great Video! Great Points! You have a new subscriber. I was hoping I could go down to one device (get rid of the MacBook Air) I am a little disappointed that the keyboard is not detachable from the cover but hopefully it is light enough to carry around. I guess we will have to see … Thanks! Meh. What are you gonna do on it watch YouTube? It ridiculous how much tech costs now. The iPhone should not be over £700. They just go up every year in price and Apple just epext everyone to pay more as if people earn more every year You can by super powered desktop PC for $3600.  I mean the only reason I would consider and iPad is for Procreate. Also Apple could have a touch screen computer or an iPad that can run full software... but they want you to buy two devices.  They are very smart with when it comes to getting people roped into buying more. I still do not think an iPad can replace a desktop or laptop computer, but like I said they do not want you to buy one or the other... they want you to own both.<br>Gaming on a mobile device or a Mac simply is a long was off to what a PC or console can do. Unless you just want to play mobile apps. compared to other reviews idk but this feels sponsored, wired move aruan? We will be Android for ever Does bro get paid by both apple and samsung?😭 Apple didn&#39;t make iPadOS &quot;simpler&quot;, they are restricting our freedom to run macOS on iPad, heck I bet you could run macOS on a newest iPhone More CRAP from Apple <br>reviewed by the ultimate isheep! Sorry, but this feels like an ad. Not sure why you are so overwhelmed all of a sudden since this generation and the M1 are basically the same thing. Video idea:  Video on the current LARGEST cellphones on the market.  For the visually impaired,  and or people who want large scaled screens. Ciao! Avrei bisogno di un cellulare che abbia un ottimo audio, che abbia una ottima batteria, che regga l&#39;utilizzo continuo di chiamate e e-mail, dai 350 ai 450. Cosa mi consiglieresti? Another CTRL+C, CTRL+P by APPLE. Shot this video morning &#39;till night. Bravo!👏🏼🤣 I think I should sell one of my lungs Disappointed you switched to a Google Galaxy phone. Touchwiz is so bad So there&#39;s a new category called Tabtop? A Tablet that replaces the Laptop. 1min20. Great statement ever! IPads? Just one 12.9 M1 is enough for me. But if they made specific use pads or tablets for secretaries to get the boss&#39;s signatures, or for medical uses like in Star Trek, now THAT would be an entirely new market! You heard it here first! I think it was BECUZ you can, i cant even get myself to touch a apple product, i did about 10 years ago and i still feel dirty.<br>And i sure as hell can not pay the price they demand. All this was available innsamsung tab s9 ultra :) Overpriced junk Watching this video even if i will never buy this in my lifetime because i will never afford this 😂 I buy a iPad to play mobile games,  no to use like a laptop Get a Samsung Android. I think the iPad pro camera would be the next iPhone 16 back camera layout Yeah, another shiny way to castrate the internet even more. bro forgor about people who dont have phones or ipads and need websites to exist I find annoying this whole situation because a 1TB iPad cost more than my brand new alienware laptop with the highest intel card, and highest graphic card that plays 4K video games. I REALLY WANT this new iPad because besides gaming and making 3D animations I love drawing and dumping my iPhone pictures from my travels on it. But a 1TB M3 iPad cost double as the alienware. 🙃 I don’t like that Apple is choosing to test its costumers with high prices and see who is willing to pay them. Right now I’ll wait for a discount to buy one TBH. Not related but a request please. Summer time is here. Party speakers look interesting. What is the best value for money? RGB, rollable and amazing sound quality? Gee……for a top notch tech reviewer……he didn’t cover the memory aspect? Long story short, he bought a tablet that&#39;s so ludicrously costly because he can pay for it and earn way more by making a video on it. Truth it is. Bro check oppo find x7 ultra it can buy my laptop 4 times Gaming on a Mac 😂…full stop. To much money. Waste money for 99% of people😂😂 ngl, bought an m1 ipad pro back in 2021, still bought a macbook pro in december last year. Nothing can replace a laptop. I see a lot of people hating on the iPad pros now because of there extremely high expensive price tags but they have always been that way. I personally don’t buy new iPad pros every year, I generally buy a new one every two years but depends on what it has to offer. And for iPhone pro max, I generally buy one every year but again, depends on what they offer in terms of changes/ new features. I prefer Apple over android because of their design quality. The difference to the M2 iPad pro isn&#39;t so much that it can now replace a MacBook completely and can&#39;t before 😅 also you are still missing whole office implementation with word, PowerPoint and Excel. I bought a M1 ipad pro with the magic keyboard and imagined I&#39;d use it for everything but in reality I&#39;m still on my desktop all day as it&#39;s so much quicker LOL, today my wife, who has a 2018 iPad Pro that can do 90% of the stuff in this video, ordered a reMarkable tablet after seeing it here. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=491\">8:11</a> “really massive laptop”<br>Really bro? Really? at this point its just a nerfed macbook pro its been a month since i tried to recover my account and apple still hasnt reached out to me to let me access my account The most elaborate Apple Ipad Advertisement, But no matter what anyone says to me No feature can convince that price tag. many things are just showoff ill get a ipad when it allows me to do coding and development work which will prob never hapen So Samsung tab is wayyyy better 😂 That is tim cook strategy. Because apple sales is dropping so they need to raise the price so they can compensate with their overhead expenses. Its not the quality of the product and specs you are paying anymore Just preordered the iPad Air 2024 m2 stapping over from the iPad mini 6 gen 16 min to get a 3 minute message across &quot;Exciting unboxing and review of the Viy OPEI P30U by Mrwhosetheboss! Subscribe for more tech content and don&#39;t forget to hit the like button - definitely worth checking out! &quot; Simple answer: because you are rich AF Exactly! If they could spend just a few months thinking of a way to revolutionize tablet operating systems in a way that made them feel like not just a giant iPod.. This thing with its hardware specs could actually possibly be portable powermachine you could bring with you to the coffee house  and leave your laptop at work to charge and not risk an unexpected MacOS (or Win 11) update). REALLY not a big Apple guy... seriously, I&#39;m from Alabama.. not New York, but unfunny dad jokes aside... does so one else think this? I love smart phone operating systems, I love computer operating systems! Tablet Operating Systems.. just seems like iOS couldn&#39;t change into something wonderful during its transition to MacHood... I thought u had me Apple.. at OLED, 4K, some screen texture or something lol, skipping 2 processor numbers because you think multiplying a number by 2 defines the revolutionary processing evolvement as seen in your ancesteor&#39;s you abandoned a long time ago just because.. you couldn&#39;t process the truth nobody will every know how to invent a productive, fun and useful OS for that gawky shameful frame of a freakish iPoMacan&#39;tosh. Is this video sponsored by Apple or smth? 💀 Guys quickly sub to Arun, he is only 4 million away from overtaking apples sub, don&#39;t forget Arun made a promise of creating a phone with the best parts of every phone&#39;s Guys i am an idiot sooo yea I bought it and cool fact i am 15 ………. Because you can afford it ? “Hope it comes with a built-in money-making app to help recoup that investment! 😄” It still won&#39;t play real games like Cyberpunk 2077 on ultra high settings with ray tracing. So for the same cost I&#39;ll stay with my PC I think. &quot;Why you spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.&quot;?  Dont be a soyboy, just answer: &quot;because I can! Greed. They asked for $3600. Why bother? Just ignore! By X&#39;mas they price down, and then soon another launch, recycling old design and find excuses to launch gimmicky features to increase prices. Same marketing ploys, iBored! Apple still think all customers are nerds and dummies. Wake up, Apple! In this economy, $3600 can do a lot of meanful things! Your laptop is far better then 1M iPads. The iPad cost is disheartening.  Unless they open the iPad to other use cases ie use it as a phone and sync my watch or align more to the Mac side of the house they will still be in a space that nobody gets and everyone spends the money then the iPad sits what game is at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=518\">8:38</a> ? The iPad is far more versatile than any laptop. If you compare task per task you will easily see that a laptop is a very old and outdated platform. On iPad every app works in the App Store, it’s a notepad, pc, mirror of your phone, touchscreen, and best screen. This is more expensive than my slav- i mean workers As always the iPad pros has all the bells and whistles, but unfortunately the software will always hold it back.<br><br>They will never sell Mac books if they empower the iPad pros. I think the iPad Mini is the perfect tablet size. It can replace the iPhone for streaming and games without feeling too big. bro one slip and its over Because you are rich and make even more money by reviewing it lolz I thinks.......

Not running Mac OS is still a deal breaker for me. My M1 Ipad Pro has been sitting in my closet. I bought it maxed out when it was released, but ended up hardly using it. I need full OS, not iPad OS. That nano coating is very likely a very dumb idea seeing as it appears fragile. There already exist very reasonably priced screen protectors that provide a paper-like writing experience &amp; a matte finish. That nano screen seems like a complete waste of money. And in a twist of irony, you could use a portable Samsung SSD as external storage. Oh the dongle life Desperately in need of 18 dollar...  For my exam😢 Still not worth it. I noticed that Samsung Ultra phones have Samsung DEX mode - this is when you connect your phone to a screen and a keyboard with mouse - and you got a desktop experience from a mobile phone!<br><br>I gave it a try and my conclusion is: it can replace my work laptop used mostly for zoom and teams meetings. The only thing I find annoying is that in DEX mode the phone cannot make use of an external webcamera that I use with Zoom.<br><br>Otherwise all the other apps - are nearly identical to Windows PC experience: powerpoint, outlook, teams, zoom, etc.<br><br>It is incredible how close the mobile devices came cto replace laptops. I have used my my s22 ultra for about year as a laptop. I only had problem at campus, now I am using tab s9+ and s22 ulta together and never wanted to go laptop in all honesty, neither an ipad nor a phone with desktop mode can replace an actual working computer. sure they all can watch youtube but at the end of the day if you&#39;re gonna use productivity apps you&#39;re better off with a pc. @@adorableredfox if you define productivity apps as office 365, teams and zoom - yes, DEX mode can do that just fine. @@adorableredfox you are right bro. Laptop has no use for me. So tablet is just fine Laptops stayed relevant because if OS It&#39;s funny how I&#39;ve had the exact oposite thinking from you on tablets vs phones. After the pandemic I started working from home and I barely go out now, so there&#39;s no point in spending a lot of money on a smartphone, I rather spend on an iPad, have a better and bigger screen and sound and have a cheap phone for when I go out. +1 <br><br>And you can always hot spot any phone to the tablet for data / internet People better get AppleCare+…..😅 No offense but your review seems kinda biased . How about the charger 😢 Phone apps better than desktop apps... Yikes, that&#39;s a unique take. Credibility has taken a hit. Don&#39;t want to lose that Apple access! sir what you think about huwayei pura 70 ultra? I&#39;m amazed at people like JRE&#39;s obsession with equating things having the ability to be bent in half if you REALLY try with all your might means its a bad product. He&#39;s been rolling with this clickbait for so long for easy clicks but its never once actually mattered in my use of a product. Lets stop acting like it matters unless it happens in everyday life. <br><br>I have the iPhone 15 Pro Max which I almost didn&#39;t get cus he said its so flimsy and will bend easily.... well its been how many months now and Its never even been a thought. I know why: Because you are one of the leading tech reviewers on YouTube, and NOT buying one would mean losing out on millions of views and potential subscriptions this video will generate for you. <br><br>You have to buy this to be able to long-term test it to create this video, to stay relevant. <br><br>You can also write off this iPad to boot. Simple. I don&#39;t understand this sentence: &quot;You can also write off this iPad to boot.&quot;<br>what do you mean by this? Tax write off since it’s used for work Mane mane mane Sure since he is a tech YouTuber he needs to buy everything Apple puts out.. but you gotta listen to him and understand his points too. The point of replacing his current daily-use tech, the progression of tablet technology and its relevance in today&#39;s world etc etc. Those points are something which are key to the video He really doesn’t need to write it off for #1 he can return it and get his money back after he does some reviews and get the cheaper one if he really wants to keep one after but mostly with the amount of views he creates that video more than probably paid for \\u200b@@jasonross2513 Do you think that means &quot;free&quot;? Whats the point?? It cannot do anything close to a full macbook pro how dare you compare remarkable with the stupid apple crap You are rambling saying a whole bunch of nothing lol. There&#39;s literally been no justification for that price at all. Do yourself a favor get the best tablet ever Samsung tab s9 for a fraction of the cost and way better features AYOOOOO that toothbrush technique is crazy One thing that I’m super disappointed is that but the Air M2 and iPad Pro M4 doesn’t support Apple Pencil 2, but it supports the lower end USB-C Pencil.  So if I were to upgrade and get either one, I need spend another $130 for a pencil.  The second disappointment is that there are two different Magic Keyboards for the Air and Pro: the Air doesn’t have a function role and have smaller keys like the ESC and Delete, but cost the same as the Pro keyboard.<br><br>I don’t feel like a need a Magic Keyboard and I’m just as happy using my full-sized foldable keyboard and trackball when I need a computer like setup.  But I use Apple Pencil a lot, so I’m on the fence instead of upgrading my Air 4, I will wait another two years for a new Air or maybe a Pro.  Or should I get a new Air and Pencil Pro…? Can&#39;t believe even this guy just start to be a fanboy... Crazy how Apple just see and does everything for the fanboys... Although i wasn&#39;t expecting Mrwhostheboss becoming the next Tim Cook... problem with most tablets(surface pro excluded) they are saddled with a essentially smartphone OS if they had full fat linux on them they would be far more usefull<br>yes i disagree they are still just big phones 😢in my country a second hand Mercedes Benz C200 costs 2700 Tbh.... I have an iPad pro from like 2 years ago. And I honestly do not use it. It&#39;s the most useless device I have. They need to create iPadOS Pro to get the juice out of these beasts. Bro was really getting in with that toothbrush if you know what I mean 😂 You got to love Apples sales strategy.<br>The Pencil is still only $129.00.😵\\u200d💫😄 All of your use cases sum up to about 2 maybe 3 uses a month imo Why? Because you have the money to buy it $3600 for an iPad Pro as configured?<br><br>Hope you get enough value out of it to justify that price.<br><br>And it only has 16 GB RAM.<br><br>Well, it is very portable… Considering how frequently my M1 Ipad crashes and bugs. It doesn&#39;t matter even if they add a M100. Fix that shitty OS. Make file transfer across pc/phone easier. Provide more free apps. <br>I can buy two a high config PC and a samsung high end tab with that price which doesnt bug that often. So, NO thank you. Only 300,000 subscribers away from overtaking MKBHD and stealing his crown...... 🤔 Starting to become an Apple advertising channel 😢 took Apple only 13 years more than their competitors to implement an Oled screen in their tablets. Oh wait, the &quot;normal&quot; iPads are still LCD, ohwell... down payment on car? or ipad? Your move. What a waste of money He M4 is a phone chip $3400 my goodness 🤔🤭😕😞💀☠️☠️ You could get for the same price a windows gaming laptop for the best games ever, a decent tablet to watch youtube and do some browsing (lets be real, thats what you end up doing with it anyways) and a professional drawing tablet. thas crazy and all but im on a macbook m1 air rn and i cannot genuinely see the difference between the m3, or m4, and m2. really, they are better, get me right, but this macbook can do anything the other macbooks and macs and ipad&#39;s can. Yes yes, but it still has iPadOS. Not going to replace Mac anytime soon. Q: Why Mrwhoseheboss spents $3600 on the iPad Pro M4?<br>A: To show others why he&#39;s the boss. I got my iPad Pro m3 for 100% free Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra Fun fact convert that money it’s costs for that tablet you’ll see in south Africa it’s not nice living here iglad? really?  😂😂 nice video though Why not a surface? iPad Pro isn&#39;t ready until we get a Pro OS - The File system is garbage on the iPad. And let&#39;s not talk about Adobe Creative suite lmao it&#39;s still ipad os... You spent it because you had the money , no other reason. I don’t have the money so i can’t spend on it sadly . Don&#39;t forget that you can also easily pair an apple mouse to iPad now too. I do it regularly. That will cost $10k or more where I live... thats a no from me dawg. The tipping point should come with a complete rebrand. The desktop iMac should revert to Macintosh or Mac (G10 or something) and the portable Mac, which is the iPad should be just called the iMac. In the near future there will be no discernible benefit to a laptop meaning the MacBook can die and just leave us with Mac for desktop and iMac for portability. That is my dream. I still use my iPad 7th over my 13 pro max sometimes. I don’t carry it around outside. Would upgrade to the iPad 10 this year. Ok so you picked up a subscriber. Excellent presentation. Thanks I thought you spent the money to impress the girls.  lol. jk Hi ..ive been watching your videos for almost two years now ill like to request that on your next samsung review please 🙏 ask samsung why isnt good lock on some other countries like south africa while we get the same phone with same chips im currently using a S23 ultra I’m late Just make it a bit thicker so it can have a larger battery. Things have gotten smaller and now things should last longer without charging every few hours. No Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra? 5,1mm? Imagine if they made it 7mm and it had double the battery life You know to make the new iPad better, make a video about the best cases for the new iPad Pro for the 11 -13 inch<br> Like about three for the 11 and 3 for the 13 lime ranging from like least strongest to most strongest Watching on my iPad 2024 - M4 edition ✅ &quot;To review it and make tons more in profit!&quot; So I also just did this. Patiently waiting for delivery … yeah right! Now before you all complain, I am STILL using my 12.9 IPad Pro, series 1, NL2J2LL/A - A1653. It does almost everything I need it to do, minus, Apple Health, decent video editing, and a few apps out there that do LiDAR scanning and 3D modeling. Some areas I would like to get into. When I bought this one, I also though it was insane to spend $2000 on a tablet, but that tablet has lasted me 9 YEARS. So that is $222 a year over that time. Well worth the specs and performance is has. So the $3600 for this new one, expect to get the same out of it, is $400 a year. It also has done so much, and has been so flexible, I cannot list all the apps that have been used on here to perform some simple basic task. Yeah a MacBook could probably do the same, but I cannot press a block on the screen to get it to work, I have to have a keyboard or mouse with it, and when desk space is tight, and in most of my cases nonexistent, it was great to just interface with the screen and done. I think Apple is very close to “correcting” iPadOS and actually allow Mac OS apps to just work on it, when that happens, I think all those MacBook users screaming about the cost, will be screaming for the iPad Pro. If you decide to give the tablet away, I could really use one for my business ventures. Amazing channel. Keep up the great videos. You can find a lot of other good tech products for significantly cheaper. Best of luck to ya Is actually anybody here using stage manager? If you think today is the day. Youre wrong. Apple will only do this when they feel  you are over ready. My 3080 and i7 cost 1800 quid, what the goofy is the purpose of buying such an iPad I absolutely hate the fact that all websites are becoming more and more smartphone/app-like.<br><br>I have a computer and a BFM (Big Fucking Monitor) for a reason; I am capable of having a lot of information on there and processing it.<br>The app-ification of it all just completely ruins that for me, AND I&#39;M NOT GIVEN A CHOICE ABOUT IT, it just happens, and <b>THAT</b> is what is most definitely pissing me off most about that; I&#39;ve chosen a PC for a reason, give me websites and services that fit a PC.<br><br>Fuck apps and the appification of everything digital! I don&#39;t care. The thin form factor, all of it. I&#39;m sticking with my 4th gen for the foreseeable future. I heard rumors that we were finally getting a 16-17 inch size but alas, NO...HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Why, why, why does Apple NOT listen to their customers big wants????????! Just like Samsung not listening to the millions who have been asking for an on board s-pen on the Galaxy Fold. Years of NOT listening to us. Especially the digital artist community. These companies kinda suck in the listening to their buyers realm and it&#39;s getting very old. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL 3600 BAWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. You are an iPad guy my dude. Nope, not there yet. i will not buy until the vesels are not thin and also the camera on the front must have also camera on the side You make a shitload of money from youtube, why should you care spending 3600$...u make 10 times more with this video alone. rare footage of arun not recording in his bedroom Wtf? Spending 2.8k on a tablet? You have to be RICH to even consider that. dont know if its just me but i felt last 2 videos are very boring guys, i can either buy an ipad or a car.....<br>(i already have a car lol but still, 3600 dollars can get me a decent used car) The old pencil did have a button, didn&#39;t it? You&#39;re living in a dream. They&#39;re crippling the iPad intentionally so you don&#39;t just buy it only. So it is not a smart buy That was so lame Sorry, iPad Pro with M4 chip is a total waste of resources - especially given the horrendous cost of purchasing one. I have an iPad Pro and the ONLY thing I use it for is email, Apple News, and the net. Would I consider using it for productivity apps - absolutely. But there AREN&#39;T any worthwhile productivity apps for it. I&#39;m talking in a professional situation. Yeah, you can use it to take notes, paint, et. al. but that&#39;s a far cry from a useful productivity environment. I&#39;m in the process of dumping the iPad for a Surface Pro - because I don&#39;t have a bunch of money lying around to throw at another product that I&#39;ll only use to read Apple News, email, and surf the web.<br><br>Unless and until Apple ports Mac OS to the iPad, I would NEVER consider purchasing another iPad. Actually, even if Apple DID port Mac OS to the iPad I wouldn&#39;t purchase it. Why, because in their self aggrandizing perspective, Apple has a ludicrous habit of making apps that are useful on the Mac no longer compatible with their computers/OS. I run the entire Adobe CS6 suite, which is no longer supported in Mac OS. On the other hand, the entire CS6 Suite does run on Windows. So how is it that Microsoft can make an OS that still runs these apps while Apple doesn&#39;t? Another glaring example is TurboTax. TurboTax runs flawlessly on my Win PC with no issues while I must &quot;upgrade&quot; my Mac OS to run the current version of TurboTax (I&#39;m running High Sierra on my Mac Pro and MacBook Pro, both of which run the CS6 Suite).<br><br>The WORST thing Apple ever did was to go to an annual OS update &quot;scheme&quot;, which was simply a scheme to force Mac owners to continually update their software solely to the benefit of the software developers. (I also had a &quot;new&quot; 2019 Mac Pro, which I was fortunate enough to unload since it would not run any of my Adobe software.)<br><br>People continually bash Microsoft about Windows, yet how many Mac owners run Boot Camp or Parallels to run Windows apps on their Macs because there aren&#39;t native Mac apps for their needs? i’m getting it just for the OLED…..😅 This is just a glorified ad for the newest apple gadgets. These famous channels have been on these trends recently. ur the reason why i can now stand infront of my whole class and do a speech ❤😭🤞 Omg… can get a high spec gaming pc/laptop for that price🤯😅 Fastest and most technologically advanced device to watch Netflix and YT vanilla... Not even revamced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=673\">11:13</a> has this guy ever used a mouse? Trackpads suck big time for any work. The apple trackpads are better than others, but they are still, well... trackpads. There is a reason almost no one buys a trackpad for a desktop and almost everyone with a laptop has a mouse connected to it. He may have gotten used to using trackpad, i also feel the same cause now when i try using mouse it feels way more sensitive except gaming As a coder I use trackpad but anything remotely close to editing always use mouse G102 You lost me at Samsung This is a new note 7😅 boom boom You are crazy dude.... I though the same about the ipad m1 and spanking new keyoard... useless:) Ipad is a waste of money unless you are an artist.. Its a thumb-trap...lol.. You will run back to your mac after 1 day🤣 When I watched Marqueses  video on the iPad pro, he said that the nano texture glass kind of makes the contrast worse. This is not an IPad for the average person.  It&#39;s crazy stupid expensive.  If you are filthy rich then you don&#39;t worry about the cost.  I am not. It&#39;s not that apple uses a laptop processor for an tablet, it is more like they are using a mobile processor for their laptops. Any remotely demanding application that is not hardware accelerated will kill each of these devices. They are made for a specific niche, primarily for musicians, photo editors, and video editors. Thats why you have a very fast video encoder in the M SOCs, since this will help with rendering videos, CPU based rendering would take ages on an M chip.<br>All current Apple devices are useless for any usecase that needs raw power and doesnt use hardware acceleration (like neural engine or the video engine). <br>3D modelling is a pain in the ass, as well as compiling applications from source. CAD is completely impossible in a professional work environment due to lack of software like Solidworks or Target3001.<br>Yeah AutoCAD got ported to macOS after many years, but Solidworks is still the industry standard for a lot of branches. <br>Overall GPU Performance is a complete joke on the current lineup, especially on the devices that are sold for desktop use (iMac, Mac Mini, Mac Pro).<br>Also compatibility is a BIG issue on macOS and iOS... You just do paperwork, browsing the web and composing emails? sucks to be you, buy a new device after 7 years or say goodbye to your internet connection, because new CAs dont get implemented on old versions and therefore websites that use HTST are not accessible. There is so much wrong with the apple ecosystem that the benifits are rarely worth the restrictions you have. The iPad really needs to run osX if you&#39;re going to stick a keyboard and trackpad on it. This guy is going to use it just for safari and notes. It is not a full on computer. the problem is the software. Affinity Designer work only with the iPad monitor. The secondary monitor is not supported for all apps. We need MacOS version for iPad... 3 days ago I was wondering if i should get an iPad for my pc now I think I might If it had normal operating system, then it would be usefull, but it is still only tablet, with mobile apps. Waste of money. This is just silly! Apple should just make a laptop that has a touchscreen and kill the iPads already. Why don’t we have a MacBook with touchscreen in 2024? Why? Smh hey bro nice video keep up the ggod work\\\\ You&#39;re basically realizing the benefits of the Surface Pro line over a decade later, but still facing compromises on the functionality, thanks to iPadOS. Every use case you described is literally how I&#39;ve been using the Surface Pro since 2013, and currently using a 1TB SSD 512GB MicroSD 32GB RAM i7 Surface Pro 7+ in conjunction with 43 Apps from the Play Store. It truly is a handy 4-in-1 (Tablet + Digitizer Drawing Board + Laptop + Desktop) experience and I can never settle for any mono Laptop again. That said, I must also mention I do face some reliability issues due to microsoft quality these days, but the overall uses far outweigh the issues.<br><br>Once Apple makes the iPadOS as feature-rich as macOS, then we&#39;re talking. That&#39;ll definitely be an all around better experience with 0 compromises, and likely far greater reliability than what microsoft has ever come up with. That&#39;ll be the first Mac/iPad worth my consideration... Sorry, I almost fell asleep.  No thanks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=625\">10:25</a> This one is a weird one because the Docs browser extension actually does advertise an offline mode, but I have never gotten it to work consistently in the past 10 years. I like Zoho Notebooks way better as of late tho can you plz watch out  bengoo g9000 gaming headset Apple making the price of the 2024 ipad pro like it is made with diamond or 24k gold or something seriously cmon what with the prices lately i get it that the chipsets manufacturing costs and all but damn over 2000 bucks for an ipad jeese lewis anyways arun i think its may be good decision to switch to ipad from a mac but i think it would be a little bit challenging to use but who knows you may like it This clearly is Apple sponsored. Because you needed to make a YouTube video about it. The correct answer Apple has completely lost it&#39;s way charging way to much of a premium for technology thta nobody needs. They are touting the use of final cut with the M4 , they will throttle the hell out of that ipad so that it won&#39;t melt or give somebody 3rd degree burns. Their Ipad sales will be low just like Vision Pro and they will use financial engineering to keep the stock up. There is nothing cool about Apple anymore. I think the Vision Pro has potential but they should have released a &quot;must have&quot; app at the same time. People forget that Microsoft released an advanced headset years ago and it ended up being used by engineering and scientific professionals Waiting for jerry rig everything to rip apart 😅 &quot;3600$, I mean that&#39;s an obscene amount to pay for a tablet! But I&quot; make at least 36k$ per video so who cares. apple close system sucks and pay that much for the apple hell no apple sucks in every way exept cameras to expensive to fix if it stops working or display brakes to hard and to expensive to fix and all must go through apple closed system just Over Prized Junk Expensive Trash Apple is trash  ... ok, so what is next M5, M6, M100, I do not understand If Apple were just to release MacOS for the iPad, this would be an actually good machine, despite the price.  With WWDC soon the rumors state that a new iPadOS is in the works…. But honestly it isn’t enough. MacOS needed. Fully windowed and professional OS. Since 2019 my ENTIRE YouTube channel videos have been editing exclusively on iPad. Not even my Mac with LumaFusion. <br>And now with multicam on Final Cut for iPad and Divinci resolve. A YouTuber can shoot and edit on iPhone/iPad and be a full studio. Love my m1 iPad Pro. My most used device more than my phone!! <br>Can’t wait to try out LumaFusion on M4<br><br>“think different” indeed. Waiting for jerry right now everything $3600 - ha ha .. no Hey @Mrwhosetheboss, what sweater are you wearing in your video??  It looks so comfortable Awesome videos sorry I’m sooo late It was daytime when Arun was deciding to buy the iPad then nightime at the end. Tough decisions 😅 Ipad could replace laptop?… abhi tak ka sabse chutiya device laga mujhe… i m a pro m2 user… and have a mac tooo… but ipad is shit… until it gets mac os… If Apple wants people to buy the new Ipad = they won&#39;t need to do anything!<br>Aaron did it for them already.<br>Sheep Mind Quality All The Time 👌 another good apple ad from this channel I don’t think that’s a laptop or pc replacement you still don’t have access to steam or any computer programs like actual drawing studios or computer games but ether way pretty cool just not worth the price:) It&#39;s just a tablet after all. No MacOS so it&#39;s just a glorified 13inch phone. How long until this $3,600 USD slab of glass is obsolete? I’m watching on ipad you bought it because you run a tech review channel omgad bmw m4 Jerry rigs everything will have a field day with it M4 chip to play angry birds and watch paw patrol you shouldn&#39;t drink so much Kool-Aid. dude... that a price for very good PC on windows ! um did Apple Pay you? lmao saying you&#39;d replace your laptop with an iPad is wild. Congolese children must be very happy about this information I&#39;ll stick to my galaxy tab s9 that i got for a steal/deal at $360 ... Does all i need.  Last apple product i bought was the ipad mini, damn thing won&#39;t turn on anymore, ipod touch stopped charging... and don&#39;t get me into apples refusal to allow sd cards, and its forced obsolescence damn, the price make me think that i need to get a job, but the companies in my country have many stpd requirements😤😤, such as max age😑, and you must have experience atleat for 3 years. How the fc can i get a job? <br><br><br>Owhh sorry, i am just sharing my problem to reduce my stress. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=318\">5:18</a> that&#39;s so apple Where did u get this shirt from? looks amazing I love how apple doesnt provide these influencer with free products, haha they  have to buy iPhones and iPads with their own money🤣🤣 Day 4 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. you poor? just me or did he just flex that our boy is getting married soon* i like in Aurn he&#39;s courage to express his personal opinion  regardless what the crowd think or want him to say. 👏 Courage?  Bro this is a tech channel.  If he ran into a burning building to save an old lady, thats courage iPad kids 💀💀💀 I believe there is only 1 camera at the back of the newly about to release m4 ipad pro. Tell me I&#39;m wrong. When you make videos of new products of Apple or Samsung it sounds like words of a fanboy. What is the name off the editing app BECAUSE YOUR NOT VERY SMART?   ALL APPLE PRODUCTS ARE A RIPOFF.  ONLY POPULAR  BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND THE THING TO HAVE.  LIKE EXPENSIVE SHOES THAT U CANT AFFORD &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4&quot;<br>- for content I am a huge fan of iPads since day one. But let me tell you, after one and a half years without a PC or Mac I also bought a Macbook again and that was a big relief. Why? As mentioned in the video, I can confirm that the file system is a mess, especially when you work with cloud storage. I lost so many files while editing PDFs. Btw PDFs crash regularly when I leave notes on them. Lastly, multi-tasking still doesn&#39;t work well, nit even with stage manager. When putting another window in the front, some apps stop refreshing and just forget the last edits you made - even something like word (and the app does not give you all the tools you have on a real computer). All of these problems don&#39;t have anything to do with hardware, these are all software limitations. And they will probably stay. So no, you probably won&#39;t replace your laptop with an iPad, unfortunately. I still hope for iPadOS 18, but this will be another disappointment, I guess. AVP 👽 <br>Right / and ... like that ,/ they won&#39;t ever come through /./ We.../ Nevermind / but they lost ... twice / so throw a tantrum , cause the other kid won something ,/ @Mrwhosetheboss I use the lowest spec iPad air 4 and managing files using the file manager isn’t half bad. I use an external SSD since it doesn’t have enough storage. I have to turn off the iPad every time I want to disconnect the SSD so that no files get corrupted since there is no safely remove option, that’s the only problem I have. The fact that it isn&#39;t that what will bring Apple the most money. It&#39;s them producing for the first time a 12&#39;9 ipad air. And it won&#39;t surpass the 900$ . So if you&#39;re not an editor,architect,designer or artist you now can get this huge screen with an M2 chip too for a good price comparing to the ipad Pro Software hasn’t changed.<br>You can’t put the M4 to maximum use so that’s already overpowered .<br>So on what point have you made the decision now and not 2-3 years ago when m1 iPad came out? Just being lighter and having a slightly better Apple Pencil doesn’t justify you paying almost £3k. I am watching in ipad I&#39;d buy it only to play pubg A disadvantage you may ask? It does not have a calculator app :( He probably already has division bro I mean that’s basically what is mine is a Mac without macOS There are many videos on YouTube showing people experimenting with using iPads as their only computers. I wonder why everyone goes back to their laptops or desktops. I also tried using iPad as my only computer but gave up after not being able to log into my school&#39;s online class. Editing a long paper in MS Word on iPad is also extremely uncomfortable. iPad is still a &quot;nice to have&quot; piece of tech. i rather fund my wedding for that amount. lol Fully leveraging an iPad Pro M4 in some hyper-productive fantasy is the equivalent of buying a GoPro because you fantasized about wearing a squirrel suit and flying through a canyon in the Alps. Ain&#39;t happening. &quot;They&#39;ve had a pretty big redesign&quot;<br><br>- Looks almost exactly the same as it did 6 years ago. I have an M1 MacBook Pro, with an M1 iPad Pro, and I use both for work and the reason I have both is the ability to use my iPad as a second screen. It has become such a useful feature for me if I am not at home where I have a full desk/twin monitors setup, being able to travel with my MacBook &amp; iPad means I can be just as productive anywhere I am. I could not do this before with my MacBook only because I always need a second screen for the type of work I do. iPad&#39;s are not essential in any sense, but they are an amazing tool and definitely the best tablet money can buy. Same. I love having that second screen on the go. Can you gift a cheapest ipad air? I have a dream to illustrate there through procreate 🥹 Oh dear -- I predict a maximum of one month until you post the video on how working with the iPad is so restrictive that you&#39;re moving back to the MacBook Pro. Unless the next version of iPadOS brings some unlikely major changes. So you are not the first one to have it! <br>How will we know you really ordered it?If not, smart move. I learned something😎 Im using a 32gb space phone while someone is using a 8tb device,,,,,,,being poor surely has its limitations That Remarkable without subscription plan is every college student&#39;s dream gadget😂 AND? Is it the oled will burn in? Basically, an IPad Pro is a less useful MacBook Pro with a touchscreen How does the new keyboard feel? I have the older version and I don’t like it… it makes my iPad feel like a half baked Mac… Apple is a publicly traded company that answers to their shareholders. They&#39;re not stupid to allow iPads running MacOS to cannibalize their Macbook sales.<br><br>They make more money selling two different devices that have 2 completely different target audiences instead of selling 1 device that can do it all. Great sweater. What is the brand? We need a white guy that does reviews Having an App Store makes the software you can run so boring. The extra steps in getting software out there means that most of the programs are sterile, serious and have &#39;business models&#39;. Yuck. There is a place for that, but I want computing to keep its casual, fun side. ie. an open source thing a few people hack at, or a game made over a weekend in a game jam.  I feel like maybe an iPad can be a laptop replacement for someone who is sick of computers, or scared of them. 3600usd on cocomelon accessories! hahahaha as a Samsung user I still just laugh at Apple users! This video and the comment section just prove how much yall drink the kool-aid from apple lol No tablet is worth 3600 dollars. There was ABSOLUTELY nothing in this video that justified the price tag of this tablet. The best part about it too was you can only pair the tablet with apples own design of the magic keyboard for 350 dollars haha 😂 I have the 6th. Generation of ipad pros and honestly the biggest perk is goodnotes, which lets you handwrite on the screen. But i am dissapointet that there are some apps like Microsoft 365 that dont have all the functions, though my tablet has the processing power to do them Battery is what you forget to talk about but it is something important So that you can make a vid about it, thats it. Theres nobody on earth who needs this device. Useless Bro really made this video just to make back the money for buying this ipad LOL, 2.6M views \\\\ 1000 * ~5 = $13000 made after cuts for this video. Smart. a bai engineer tu eniya chijan ch nuks kad-da en, ik wireless headphone hi bna ke dikha ta je ena hi mahar aen Because you are rich and it&#39;s nothing for you. The day I might get my Photoshop, Capture One and all the plugins for this on an iPad, I might switch- completely.<br> I have an iPad pro M2 12,9-but there is no way this could substitute my 16&quot; Macbook Pro M1Max with 64GB and 4TB.<br>And as you say- if you even have an iPhone additionally to that, the new M4 is nice, but not a must have. (BTW I use the iPad as a second screen to my MBP16-perfect match.) Can it run Brawl Stars?<a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw\"></a><a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/xsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAw\"></a> My bank account saved me from this magnificent tablet. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=762\">12:42</a>  John casterline videos how they are meant to be Reviewing apple products has actually become boring nothing new and overpriced Review the Samsung tablet, it as thin and good as the apple one i am betting when the ipad does not does satsify him at some point .. he is gonna be like &quot; well it was good but it lacked this and that so may be this tech gonna be better for the future . Huge waste of money You didn&#39;t buy it.. I dont know if youll read my message but i would love to get a new decent phone, i wonder if you could help me with that, knowing i have no income. Can you hook up external monitors to it? Just wait JerryRigEverything durability test😂 mm because....you are a fan boy You spent $3600 on the new iPad 😳 Apple’s hoping everyone else does too 😂😬 Arun: &quot;squeeze it to bring out the menu&quot;... Samsung: s-pen does that since galaxy note 2!!! <br><br>As always, great content to be up to date on tech news! keep going forward Arun! This is y I would never buy another apple product again 😂😂😂😂 I’m watching this video on a iPad pro D1 glazer Answer: because he can write it off as a business expense for clicks and will sell it later or probably return it within two weeks.<br><br>I don’t care how great the hardware is. iPad OS is a trash operating system for that hardware some guy: i just spent $3500 on a phone strapped to my face<br>some other guy: oh cool i just spent $3600 on a tablet I am not planing to sell a kidney. I should stop watching any Apple advertisement. I tried to rewatch the use cases part several times but I&#39;m still quite fuzzy on that :-D Sounds like a nice shiny thing that people try to convince themselves that they somehow need and can use.<br><br>Realistically, this could only work as a most overpriced and overpowered remote desktop to a workstation. Can&#39;t wait for the new JerryRigEverything video tonight💀💀💀 Mrwhosetheboss, bless me with one of your older phones?🙏🏾 As an iPad Pro M2user, trust me you will always need your laptop. a lot of like simple functionality still isn’t there especially on the browser and most apps. It’s only a laptop replacement in theory, but the software is just basically ios Funny guy. Paid Advertisement. Where is your &quot;Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra&quot; Review by the way????? Care to explain why y&#39;all are selective content creator? I’m going through a real rough time with Panic Attacks ATM, re-watching all your videos is really helping me. Much Love Arun! Cause I’m a successful YouTuber and can afford acts of lunacy😂😂 no, weight wont be cut by 5x times for sure when adding the keyboard This conclusion is quite premature. Until the operating system is fully optimized, real desktop browsing is enabled, complete versions of desktop applications, and the file system is improved, this will not be considered a replacement for a laptop. Do not buy this device, shame on you Mrwhosetheboss.. Still no calculator? The best machine for Minecraft and fortnight Apple is so good at marketing that even the &quot;reviewers&quot; are hypnotised by their nonsensical products. <br><br>You are better off with your current workflow and gadgets. Spending 3-4k USD on a completely new setup when you actually don&#39;t NEED it is just insane. Remarkable 2 very expensive pen and paper replacement, just write on your paper notebook and scan it with your phone. I just saw the s 24 ultra in this video even in apple event place ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=520\">8:40</a> ) Loved the gradually changing day time from the window <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=346\">5:46</a> anyone knows the song playing in background ? for me tablets are no sense for that price, at this point you can directly buy a foldable phone and get almost everything you get from a tablet. If you have to make a heavy operation you can use your laptop with a graphics card that can demolish tablets and macbooks without a grapics card. For me, weight and small dimensions (phones pros) are better than the tablets pros, like a bigger and better screen, bigger battery or slightly better performance than phones. At this price, foldables are more worthy if you can afford it. Greate tool for professional graphists, absolutely not for me. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">00:43</a> bro nah who tf brushes like that Nice one, Subscribed. Please keep&#39;em comin... when did we get to the point where the dollar is already worth less than your guys currency? XD Huawei tablet matepad 11.5 has magnetic attached keyboard and its quick too what you forgot to mention was that double oled screen has been around for sometime That guy in remixes kills me Isnt the top end Ipad with all the accessories more expensive than a Macbook ? I’ll bet you anything JerryRigAnything is gonna have the time of his life next week. As an artist and a writer I love iPads Pro. I didn&#39;t update mine for the last 6 years but I&#39;m really interested in the 2024 generation. I heard that this generation is something &quot;in-between&quot;: right before announcing some new Apple breakthroughs but still a huge power update. What do you think about it? I love how Arun never gives us up. Only dislike cause all we see if talking. Get the tablet then make a video. all this fuss is just for apple lovers. i mean, how many Apple products can one get, given that they can all do the same thing? that is a bit redundant... Excellent video‼Just some friendly advice : Please try to make 1 video every 4 days instead of 2 quick videos in 2 days, then we don&#39;t have to wait a week or 2 for the next video.😉🌠Oh yeah... by the way $3600 FOR A IPAD IS RIDICULOUS!!!! I would rather want a cheaper laptop. &quot;Taking the Pencil experience to a whole new level&quot; is classic Apple. Just added 2 boring gestures u already get in Samsung but for free @@Noname12........641 bro went straight <br><br>to the point! Samsung is better and costs thousands less, and it has an SD Card iPad Pro is really now for professionals, no need to buy the pro anymore I&#39;m a Apple 🍏 user😊 itne me toh 5 shadiyan ho jaani😂 Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4; because I have 18.6M subscribers. Problem solved. Great Video ❤Thank you so much !!!!! Still calculator will be not available in this iPad too! <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcIfY57lBJXp6AKBx4CoCA\"></a> Not everyone does photo and video editing. For actual office users, how well is this likely to work with Microsoft Office like word, excel &amp; ppt? How well is this likely to work with Microsoft Office like word, excel &amp; ppt? Question: &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4&quot;<br>Answer: &quot;To make a video&quot;<br><br>Mystery solved. Samsung gang vvv The new pencil pro is definitely gonna be good, I have lost 2 apple pencils in the past 3 years and my mom said she isnt buying me one anymore, but now after watching this video and learning about it I think it is definitely worth it and 2 months ago, my mom promised me to buy a new 2024 IPad and apple pencil! This makes sure im not gonna lose it, thanks Mr. Whosetheboss Because you have too much money and don&#39;t know what to do with that money, the dentist! It&#39;s like the best display, the best home theater , everything is best, except the price<br>man I just realised I could do a full home theater setup in that money. as the new iPad was released my iPad started bootlooping 💀💀 Watching from my ipad 9th gen 😊 only an idit gives money to Apple - bye Your phone doesn’t even have spellcheck How about Adobes InDesign? It’s a must-have in my work I use both an iMac at my office and a iPad for travel/meetings/home. they sync perfectly well.  <br><br>I am guessing any cloud system  (prefer one drive) should be able to sort both your file system and storage issues. What&#39;s that table name? Could you please tell me the tablet name and price also send me the link to get it? Customer&#39;s review : am not satisfy with the product <br>Seller&#39;s reply : He&#39;s lying no mobile device is worth that much, especially when its less powerful than other devices that are cheaper. isnt this just a surface book combined with some of the samsung&#39;s stylus features, except just everything fragmented and more expensive than any of these? XD The fact that people, even Mrwhosetheboss, are considering using an iPad as a main computer is simply mind-blowing. However, I would still stick to a MacBook.<br>Some context about me before I ramble. I am an iPad-first user, meaning that I am really familiar with iPadOS. I am using my second iPad, the iPad Pro M2 11-inch. The iPad, to me is always an annoying device to use for computing. Back in the days, even browsing on the iPad is frustrating. The iPadOS experience has come a long way and it has become increasingly better. <br>About a bit more than a year ago, I got my own MacBook after using a slow family PC for years. I fell in love with macOS (disclaimer: it is macOS Ventura when I first used macOS). It almost feels like the functionality of Windows combined with the intuitive elements of iPadOS. <br>Slowly, I picked up hobbies like coding in an IDE, video editing with an NLE, and music production with a DAW. I also use productivity software like Excel. This is when I realize the limitations of iPad.<br>When Apple made the Magic Keyboard, I decided to give it a try. However, trying to make an iPad more like my mac makes it frustrating to use. I finally came into the conclusion that my iPad is only useful for 3 things.<br><br>1. To be used as a portable second screen for my MacBook<br>2. To use a stylus on it for apps like Apple Notes, Procreate, and Affinity Designer 2<br>3. To use it when a tablet make sense like in a park, at a lecture, or at a meeting<br><br>I sold my Magic Keyboard and I am never going back. I will not try to make an iPad more like the MacBook. People would hate me for saying this but I think that Apple is going in the wrong direction with the iPad. Apple currently makes lots of products and their recent iPhone 15 lineup and MacBooks are great. The AirPods are doing great, even the Apple Watch. However, even Apple themselves are confused with the iPad as a product category, putting them in this weird spot with the MacBooks.<br>I propose that they stop making the Magic Keyboard and instead add touchscreens and stylus support for all their MacBooks. Alternatively, we can even have an ordinary tablet running iPadOS and it would literally become a mac when docked on a Magic Keyboard. I’ve been using Ipad Pro 2018 for the last 5 years<br><br>I bought the Ipad for 1100$<br>Apple Pencil gen2 for 150$<br>A cheap Bluetooth Keyboard/mouse for 15$<br><br>these 1265$ made my life and my Med school years 100x easier, and I never even needed a laptop the OLED screen and the M4 are nice but i‘m not gonna upgrade my 2020 Pro BECAUSE of the thinness 👀<br>it‘s so scary my old one already bent a little just by carrying it around in a backpack for school<br>WHO asked for a thinner iPad?!? Whats better ipad pro m1 (2021) or the new ipad air m2 (2024) ?<br>Because both product have same price Some phone apps aren’t optimised for ipad os sadly, for example instagram apple overprice  not worth !!my outlook on money changed when I realized someone making $300,000 can retire broke &amp; someone making $80,000 can retire a multi-millionaire. With the current market movement, you have $100,000 to invest. Where are you investing it?

I rather prefer this for 400 then go for srupid overprices apple products Hey peeps I have $3600 burning a hole in my pocket, don&#39;t you? DON&#39;T YOU?! BUY! BUY! BUY! You must try the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra I scared about bending test of zack It is Tantalizing but not $3600 worth of Tantalizing! One can get a 27&quot; Imac desktop and an ipad 10&quot; and an Apple watch for $3600! Camera holes make me remember Mercedes Benz 2008 head lights <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=508\">8:28</a> FALSE - there&#39;s much less UI/option customisability on mobile apps!!! TL/DW: Because I&#39;m rich and could afford buying all the newest and the most expensive toys. If they install MacOS on the ipad it&#39;s game over: yes.<br>Otherwise it&#39;s a game over: no. Sooo nobody’s gonna ask why was he sucking on his toothbrush like that??? I love Apple, and your Channel. But you all are missing the point when it comes to the iPad OS vs MacOS. For example you should ask your editors if they would use the new IPad to make one of your videos. Apple markets these IPads for creators, in factor their whole brand towards creators, yet they give us the power, but hold out by making subpar apps Not everyone is going to get it specked out the base model is like 100 or 200 dollars more than a iPhone 15 pro max😭😭 because you are a YouTuber, and then you will probably make 8k on the reviews. If you invest 3600$ then you can make 1 million dollars 💰 then why people buy tablet with phone features i feel the same whit capcut I guess saying you&#39;re shying away from Samsung tablets for using a mobile chip is kinda a biased opinion, what can&#39;t it do that the iPad with the macbook chip can do? Give away, please. I need it to learn Waiting for a good android tablet for gaming  lesser than m4 apple without heating issue glad i not iphone fan👍😀 For clout. This guy annoys me to death. The macbook being the bridesmaid in the wedding There is only one way to describe spending $3600 for a tablet, and it&#39;s not polite at all to mention it... The most specked out iPad in the US is $2600. That means you&#39;re paying $1000 more for yours. Geez! My iPad mini 2 is 10 years old this year. Cost £319. But it still does what most people use an iPad for - web, YouTube, Netflix. Seems disingenuous when wealthy people complain about a price of something, is it to try to relate to the audience? Is it an honest reaction? I have no idea, but I know I just watched you destroy three new iphones Something like a 6.8 inch phone that unfolds to a tablet is what i am looking for What motor bike game is that at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=63\">1:03</a> please tell me mountain bike xtreme . developer; pixel joy It’s more expensive than the apple vision pro I think the biggest benefit of the slim size is the fact that you can easily add a case + keyboard to it without it adding too much weight. I also don&#39;t think the comparisons to macbooks are valid since it&#39;s a different style of computer - it&#39;s not meant to compete with a macbook and doesn&#39;t cater to the same user group. It&#39;s the most advanced device in its category and I think Apple is trying to build the best device in the category and hoping the developers will build the apps that brings the users. 2.6M views pay for it? He&#39;s spending $3600 on it because he can. because you&#39;re rich? Apple over priced, move on They need to put the full OS on it and stop halting progress, Steve jobs did not fear cannibalising his own product line for the future, which is why we have the iPhone and not iPod. ipad is next gen game changing for students in a level/uni... That smart toothbrush was goin crazy 😅 Imagine Apple creating a dedicated Apple Gaming Controller and playing GTA 6 on the OLED 13 inch. Would that make people buy it? Fun Fact: An iPad with magic keyboard is even pricier than MacBook Air. However, MacBook Air can satisfy almost every kind of lite-PC-work, including Office, Video Editing as well as simple coding. For the iPad, it isn&#39;t stable on the laptop while typing and it is on the table of train. <br>To edit photos, MacBooks is capable enough because of its fundamental file management as well as desktop softwares.<br>Same Price but with fewer capabilities. I got an iPad with the magic keyboard in 2021 and it replaced my MacBook. It’s honestly my an all rounder: Allows me to work and take meetings on the g and I use it for watching and entertainment. I would actually skip the pencil (as my handwriting is so bad) andthe magic keyboard with the trackpad. Since the iPad is a touch screen, I don’t really use the trackback. To date, still one of my best purchases. nah logitech combo prolly coming to 2024 pro. We dumped Mac Laptops for all ipad maybe 3 years ago. Best computer decision I’ve made. I will only consider getting one unless it&#39;s not going to be bent as easily as the previous gen. more money than sense The galaxy tab s9 ultra is 0,55mm thin at 14,5&quot; - the new Apple tablet is 0,52mm thin at 13&quot; <br><br>Are those 0,02mm really that noticable?<br><br>edit: especially when you slab a case on it anyway. Is it not like marvelling at &quot;the new daring colours and textures of those amazing new phones...&quot; - and then putting them into a 20 ISK bumper case from AliExpress? The lack of a proper filing system is just a deal breaker for me. Dropbox is pretty awful on iPad too. You can’t connect to network drives in a sensible way either. Great for media consumption not so great for creating it. So simply put, will the phone eventually have enough PC level ability to make a Desktop, Laptop, Tablet devices obsolete. Work whole life n buy apple tablet that is life goal 😂 Can you gift me one Most expensive YouTube Kids and Netflix device ever I am watching this video brand new in My redmi pad SE..sounds good.... Unjustifiable cost Hopefully this is the start of them bringing the super slim 12-inch MacBook back. Don’t drop the iPad it might fly away The BIGGEST problem with IOS as a laptop replacement is its lack of ability to manage files.  If they did that… then I can migrate to an iPad Get a NAS, instead of iCloud and large devices :) why u talking in the dark does it bend? More Crap from Apple.. Cringe Nah nah nah I love this channel but be real my bro, the reason ya made a video on it is tax write off 😂😂😂 Lol snapdragon x is coming to takeover. I didn&#39;t think i would ever feel this way about mrwhosetheboss video but damn arun 🫠 this gotta be the stupidest video you ever created 😬 it&#39;s silly to compare laptop to iPad, they&#39;re very few niche use cases in which ipad could be good replacement but other than that it&#39;s big no! Samsung 14 feel is better product and beside nothing wrong with 12.9 pro Bro how did you get that Pokémon wallpaper anyone know? I still use a tablet. I use an Amazon fire and it&#39;s great! 😂 🎉 Nope. Will wait in a year or two Guess I don&#39;t need a MacBook Replaced the complete macbook fr Don&#39;t know about you but consuming your content makes me iGlad 😂 I never understand people outside of graphic designers who prefer an ipad over an actual laptop where you can use a real key board and real programs, not just apps. To get more views 😂 I trying to replace everything with an iPad since 2018. 99% of daily business tasks is no problem. I even miss some IPad features when using the MacBook for the remaining 1%. But as soon as you hit pro tasks (P.e. editing 1k+ Fotos, import, export) things take so long. I think the IPad is too fast for most usecases, but not fast enough for pro cases. For me it is not langer a OS thing, it‘s performance in pro tasks. But doesn’t ipadOS really hold back the functionality of this beast? 😱😱😱 If your intention is to do serious work, then you will regret this move. iPadOS cannot currently replace MacOS or Windows - You’ll see. Talks about how he struggles to find a need for a “tablet” and then 1 minute later says he always carries a paper-like writing tablet everywhere he goes because “sometimes you just want write things down.” LOL…so which is it then? iPad Pro with Pencil can do the same plus is way more versatile as an actual computer vs a dedicated writing tablet. Honestly an iPad Pro/Pencil/Keyboard combo is the ultimate and most versatile device for daily carry. If you can adjust to doing PC-tasks in an iPad workflow, you can probably satisfy 95% of your computing needs while on-the-go. If you really need macOS while on-the-go, then you can remote in to your Mac, but those needs are probably few and far between unless you’re trying to record a podcast while out on the town 😂😂 Ayo that toothbrush part looks sus bruv That is really the coolest Tee I have seen for long. Where did you get it? me convincing myself that i made a good purchase There was a time when apple (Steve Jobs era), used to upgrade product lines and lower the price. Or offer a more affordable product line. Aww the good ol days where apple products where affordable and useful. I’m been in Apple since Apple IIe 😂.  Now my setup two pads multiple screens with a docking station 😅 The videos are like Neverending thumbnails if Jobs was around, this would have probably been holographic All this power and capability and we can’t get a freaking calculator app Watching this on Xiaomi pad 6s pro 😂 S23 ultra guy here I have an ipad air 4 and while apple advertises new releases like its going to change my life, in most cases, rarely does. I&#39;d rather wait a year or two longer for the tech to normalise and for more people to have general use opinions Yes it looks wonderful but at those pricing levels the market is going to be thin. Remember Apple sell around the world. Outside the US and G-7 countries the existing range is a luxury and often retails for more than in the US. If Apple aren’t careful so e other manufacturer is going to come in and with a cheaper product steal their lunch. Yes leaving the Apple family is difficult but how much would a top of the range Ipad, Iphone and watch cost you? There are two kinds of people in this world:-<br>1. Uses Apple<br>2. Just watch other people use apple coz they know deep inside nothing can beat a beefy windows gig. Tbh you&#39;ve repeated the same stuff again and again here, became boring ,<br> feedback if you use it at the profesional level you noticed the shorts. The fact you said you don&#39;t edit anymore tells that any iPad will do for you. lovely screen true please, giveaway this 2024 ipad pro on your subscribers🫠 We lost arun as an Android user well done tim cook well done This video was a full ad baked with multiple ads in it…. YOU SOLD OUT! $3600 hahaha nope Mr Boss went day to night recording this video. Can buy M3 Macbook Pro medium storage Totally like you will explain to your wife why you spent $3600 for that. Right before she will kick you out. )) You are probably gonna switch back to Mac soon Smart tooth brush part was kinda sus I wish they had a pro version for iPad mini. I feel that’s still more useful than a 13 inch iPad trying to replace a laptop that will never happen. To be honest I have both MacBook and iPad and I really love my iPad when doing my school work on the go instead of my computer I just use Apple keyboard and trackpad folio and it’s all doing very good for me Good job They would still sell a lot of em. No, thanks. I&#39;m fine with Galaxy A9+ sub $200 tab. It plays YouTube and Netflix just fine. Because I’m rich biach 😂 Still can&#39;t use VsCode or programming IDEs 16 minutes of straight yapping on a product you dont even have ur hands on yet is crazy. get that bag I guess Ok ok, ill go buy one tomorrow Switching to an IPad only is condemning yourself to an endless amount of Subscription services.. since every app basically has one.. Brother,<br>What is the name of your notepad look like tab ???<br><br>Please tell the model no. $3,600 piece of paper will fold like a piece of paper. get a high-end PC. Go Go I won&#39;t tell you twice. $3600 - What a Bargain, Thamks Apple!!!  <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/2sIfY8vIG8z96ALulYDQDQ\"></a>. It&#39;s funny to think that when Apple released the first ever iphone, it only cost $200. i still prefer laptop(PC mode browser) and website<br>certain functionalities aren&#39;t available on apps, you&#39;d have to eventually open your laptop on browser PC mode to access those functionalities I bought the M1 tablet didn’t like it you can almost buy a used car with that amount The screen is so nice on the previous gen ipads. Macbook air to pro is meh, but the ipads are impressive. I dont use a tablet, but curious how this new one looks irl. I&#39;ve used my iPad instead of a MacBook for ten years. A few weeks ago, I bought a MacBook Pro. And uh yeah, don&#39;t get an iPad. He&#39;s not mentioning a massive variety of things that the iPad cannot do. Every website just works on a laptop. iPadOS can be crap for a ton of sites and apps. Trust me, it&#39;s a completely different experience. Thinking about selling my iPad at this point because idk what to do with it. The script of this video is from previous video The correct question is: how to make a content that worth $3600 for my ipad pro.. Yeap!.... Yes, but Surface has been doing this for many years ago!!! And it´s it´s doesn&#39;t run a app OS!!!! 😉😉 Other than using the pen for drawing/notetaking, I still see no use for a tablet in my life. Everything a phone can do a phone can do better, and everything a laptop can do a laptop can do better. I don&#39;t have anything I notice falling into that grey area in the middle where I wish I had a tablet. And definitely not one that costs more than a laptop. Awesome!!! I have the previous gen iPad Air that I bought in November and fell in love with the Apple Pencil. I love the fact that the new Apple Pencil isn’t compatible with the last gen iPad. Good on Apple to want the best for me forcing me to upgrade my iPad just for Find My. They’re always have my best interest in heart 🙃🙃🙃<br><br>- a loyal perpetually annoyed Apple fanboy Even is today&#39;s world where the majority of web traffic is on mobile/tablet devices... the web just still doesn&#39;t feel at all designed for it, to me. The amount of times I&#39;ll abandon a checkout on my phone to pick back up on my computer because I was frustrated and having issues is astronomical. That&#39;s what the tablet does best, better than phone and portable and almost as good as computer experience if not as good or better. I don&#39;t enjoy searching for flights km phones but do on tablet and laptop It’s because websites are built using laptops, not phones. Mobile will always be an afterthought that isn’t tested as often. Never really have an issue with websites on a mobile device, I almost never have to use my laptop… good for Aaron that Apple made a device with a price/specs which can only be justified by his needs @@jamesalexduranyeah what is OP buying? 99% of my checkouts don’t have any issues Are you using iOS? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> 😏.... 😂 The day it support MacOS is the day I consider buying it Watching on iPad 9th gen 🙂🫠 Yea I bought the iPad Air 6 and though that was expensive😅 The biggest downside of the iPad has been the lack of software. We are getting closer. But as a 3D artist, it&#39;s not there. If Zbrush is any good on the iPad later this year that would be a game changer. I mean I would still need marvelous and substance but hopefully Zbrush being on iPad encourages everyone else to hop on. and development There are a lot of touchscreen laptops or pc tabs. iPad is only thin because it&#39;s not supposed to handle those softwares. They wouldn&#39;t put pc operating system on it for a reason, it&#39;s because the thermals will never work with that form factor, that&#39;s why with same specs there is or will be a laptop too to do those things. I feel like mrwhosetheboss using AI for this video (including audio) Only an idiot will spend that much on a device that depreciates over time, has no Apple buy back option, no self repair, no more than a year of warranty, very low resale value and a high performance m4 chip that just sits there with nothing powerful to process, as you can’t run full fledged software on it. I think it really depends on what you do. Most don’t need it though. <br><br>I might pick up a maxed out one to use for editing 1080p/4k footage and pairing it with blackmagic design’s new micro colour panel. It has a groove on the back for the iPad to nest into and the screen is amazing for grading footage. Look it up. You lost 3600 dollars. 👀 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 What&#39;s with the annoying wallpaper Imagine spending 3k on a tablet just to play angry birds Looking forward to your wedding review 🤣 I&#39;m watching this on a $200 CAD tablet right now. I cant wait to waste money for 0,6 mm thickness difference Buying products from Apple is like spending a percentage of your life savings to get F&#39;d in the starfish and you don&#39;t get to choose who does it. Samsung tablets are 5.6 mm. Not that much different from 5.3 to the naked eye and 1/4 the price and also more features but slower... It&#39;s incredible what Apple did here but honestly that&#39;s still too heavy for my liking.  I end up putting down my existing tablets because it&#39;s just not comfortable enough to use long term.  Now... the technology behind it... Freaking AWESOME!  Just no thank you in the end for the price and weight. Maybe because you have money and dont care to spend 20k (and more) in Apple products? Very smart you turned into a laptop Next year T-Mobile will have these for free with a 2 year mobile plan Waste of cash!!! why you promote this crap?? still waiting to get my first apple brand 🥲 damn i&#39;ll be damned, we&#39;re approaching the PDA era I just want an iPad without cameras. I don’t care for cameras and I HATE seeing doofuses using an iPad to take photos and videos. Bik gayi hai ye sarkar. What are you going to do about iPads&#39; lack of browser plugins? whyy not buy M2 tablet? i  can do everything M4 can using M2 ipad. Doesn&#39;t chrome os cover all these bases and has a decent file system. ? &quot;I wanted to make a video on it.&quot; aka you can get that sht written off as a business expense LOL. We see you. I knew why he bought it when I saw this video has 2.5M views. He bought it because he&#39;s rich and because he&#39;ll make more money from suckers who watch this video than he spent on the product. And now, having commented, I will leave before I watch. Really Arun? 4000 for a tablet? 😢😢 What about the poor people? Because you have a youtube cahnnel The perfect tagline: &quot;The iPad Pro M4. When you have more dollars than sense.&quot; It really depends the type of person you are: someone that does coding or needs a file system, a laptop or desktop is a lot better. A gamer doesn’t want tablets or even laptops (because they basically gotta stay connected 24/7). Now for a teacher (like me) who only utilizes Google classroom and basic apps it’s so easy and more maneuverable to work on an iPad. It’s nice because as a SpecialEd iI can even walk around with an thin iPad and show the kids slides or concepts in a more hands on (touch) manner which is what some of these kids prefer and work with better. Also for an artistic person that does photo editing, video editing, or drawing/ painting an iPad is amazing! Just really depends on what your habits are tbh. I’d say like 70% of people would work better with a PC but a lot of people are casuals and don’t really use apps specific that only work on laptops - for those it’s very nice to use an iPad Just preordered a 13” pro with 1tb in space black and I am so pumped. The last time I was this stoked to get a new piece of tech I was 12 years old waiting for the Nintendo Wii. What makes you more excited about this one than previous iPad Pros? @@PressContinueToQuit that double stacked OLED, mostly. Also just very glad the front facing camera is in the right spot now so I won’t look like a dingus on zoom calls. I love the space black and the thinness is pretty neat as well. I just can’t wait to get this in my hands. I prefer using an iPad to a traditional laptop, this one just looks spectacular. Apple actually making something that isn’t the same as the last thing that they made is surprising to me 😅 Umm.. because you have money burning a hole in your pocket It&#39;s an ipad, no one buys an ipad My gaming laptop is only 1000$ this video was rather entertaining. You have gained a new subscriber.!! No one should ever spend 3600 for an oversized tablet. Please get some help if you have already done so. 🤣 Bro I thought it was $360 Just give me a M4 PRO Mac Studio and I’ll be happy My iPad Pro M1 does everything I need as a video editor/colorist, an engineering student, and an office employee.<br><br>I can video edit in DaVinci Resolve and stream using the USB-C input with a capture card.<br><br>I can run engineering software like Fusion 360, MatLab, Shapr3D, etc.<br><br>I can also run office, XMind, etc.<br><br>All this with cellular data and a detachable touchscreen. yes but you&#39;re not rich. He got the M4 and made millions Bro ngl you’re probably the first person ive ever heard of getting through engineering school with an iPad. Where you mechanical? I couldn’t imagine, i mean does it support Matlab simulink, how does it even handle any computationally demanding matlab tasks. What about arduino ide for programming or rasp pi for flashing microcontrollers? Also you can’t run ansys, any Dessault programs, Altium, any PLC or robotics software. What about 3d printing software for exporting G-code. No offense bro, engineering is for windows, I couldn’t imagine working on a senior design project using an ipad i think they are great for taking notes, making reports or reading spec sheets. But im assuming you spent a fair amount of time on the school computer because iPads literally don’t support most mechanical engineering software, and its very limited. I don’t know why you didn’t just get a basic dell with like a 3050 or something. I personally have a macbook air but also a pc, and without my pc, I would’ve literally never been able to leave the computer lab. Dude It’s kinda hard to believe you 😂 @@seriessplayer62747Engineering student here. I decided to try my luck at doing my mac workload on my ipad, just to see if it  was possible. I couldn’t even get past the microsoft login page for my student email. The literal login page wouldn’t load on my ipad. And god forbid I try to code on it, the only language this thing can run is Swift. Awful device for college if you’re trying to use it for anything beyond note taking @@seriessplayer62747 I’m biomedical engineering, so I need to be able to draw organic chemistry structures and take complex notes.<br><br>I don’t need to run Raspberry Pi IDEs, MatLab actually runs in the cloud (so that’s handled), and I can use the departmental computer for random specific tasks (like COMSOL for Fluids Modeling). It&#39;s understandable why Johny Ive has left Apple, knowing that he is its brain behind the innovation. However, now Apple has been plagued with uninspired and unsuccessful ideas. I love my previous gen iPad Pro and I am jealous of this new one and I have been an Apple fan for decades but this video comes across as a guy trying to justify dropping more than 3Gs on a goddamn tablet. 😂 Have we tried the bend test yet? At least people won&#39;t really be carrying these around in their pockets and sitting on them... I think the BEST thing about these new models is that hopefully it&#39;ll continue to reduce the price of the older versions! I&#39;m still running an iPad Air2!! And it&#39;s still perfectly fine for my use case, which essentially is just consuming web content, messaging and the occasional email. At the price, does it make any sense to buy one of these instead of a Macbook for ANY Productivity use cases? I&#39;m a dentist. What in the worldly fuck is a smart toothbrush? Thanks for keeping me entertained I hope apple make everything thinner again... Fat macbooks and iphones are a disaster! Dreaming to grabs ipad one day With $3600 I would go an buy a 4090 and ok system to put it in...  Oh, ill put 10tb of storage in there just cus.... mac doesn&#39;t give you that option.... The whole video honestly though... fr just sounded like he was trying hard to justify paying $3600 for a tablet lol. Why? So u can tell us the truth about it? An obscene price... pays it 😂. You keep buying it they will keep pushing the price people are willing to pay. You all come across as so elitist (tech YouTubers). None of you have had the grapefruits to plainly say &quot;who is this for? Who care about M4 or an oled screen at this price?&quot; Seriously, there are lay off everywhere and I understand you&#39;re not the makers of these devices. But you are purveyors of information. And it is your duty clearly tell Apple that consumers don&#39;t want this at this price. They don&#39;t. The vision pro has failed and so will this. Instead, you&#39;re all too comfortable to be smiling talking heads as long as apple gives you that sweet sweet sponsorship. Pathetic. I have may MacBook Pro M2<br>And just bought a HP Spectre and love it. Got it on sale for $899. Ultra 7 16 gb and 1 tb Hd oh!!!!  Force Touch pad also. <br><br>I switched to windows. Screw Apple. Easy to buy when you&#39;re a disgustingly overpaid YouTuber I never see people with the pros just the cheapest one from Walmart. I’m starting to think Apple only makes the most expensive products so influencers make a I paid the price of a used car for an iPad so you don’t have to video. As a photographer, editing on an iPad Pro is absolutely a pain for one simple reason: the file system. My workflow involves dumping my raw photos onto a NAS, editing them, and then saving them back to the NAS, and there&#39;s no way to do that efficiently with an iPad. Why is that? They added the ability to mount NAS shares into the Files app some versions ago, is it just that the photo apps don&#39;t work with them that way? @@CubeApril Dude&#39;s scrambling to set this up 😂 I&#39;ll buy one when they bring the MacOS to the iPad, I guess it&#39;s good for non-pro users right now Think I&#39;ll stick to my Tab S9 FE which cost me about 85% less than this 😂 wow apple must be paying a lot. never though he&#39;d be a sellout too. sad day. Bruh, stop rickrolling us . I see the background. Tried to replace my mac with the iPad... it just isn&#39;t there yet. You constantly are hit with things that you have to figure out how to do that just work on the Mac. Best of luck though, maybe the new iPad will be different. he talks about this like ipads never existed before... more performance for what? watching netflix? cmon dude &quot;I&#39;m gonna bring my M4 to school&quot; 💀 So, first it was all about touch screens, now it is about not having to touch the screens 🙃 You should check out the HMD phones! new ipad means the previous one will have a good discount soon Sweater brand? Can i shoot with my M4 iPad? I love and use my iPad Pro 2018 every day, but I won’t pay that kind of money for one. Get ready to use one app at a time forever when using this $3,600 iPad. I carry my laptop all the time since I spent big $ on an iPad so I could leave my laptop home. iPadOS still is sure we have no use for a Finder, so there’s that. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. It quacks like a notebook. As a Macbook (&quot;Late 2011&quot;, still rocking for music production!) Fanboy, former iPad and iPhone User I gotta say, I feel your sentiment. Very much. Apple do make really top-nodge hard- and Software. The boomer for me on iOS Devices is, the lock-in factor, and the closed ecosystem. Beeing stuck on devices w/o File-System, forcing me  to use  apps for file-transaction, makes you end up using slow &quot;over the air&quot; syncing to achieve distribution of your files on multiple devices, or hardware back-ups.<br>Although, I gotta say, the Sync between an iPhone and a MacBook is waayyy more convenient and functioning, than any android file transfer. (Do you have an app recommandation which remembers which files were synced like iPhotos / Photos app does for Android?)<br>Still, iPhone feels kinda &quot;limited&quot; to me, as it  has limited options for basic functionality still (did they re-invented the battery percentage icon + number duo yet? :D)<br>And owning an iPad for sure will remind you  often about &quot;why not use an iPhone as convenient addition?&quot;.<br>Each to his own, and if you can afford the apple family, why not give it a try. My Samsung galaxy S21 Ultra still makes me smile every day with its superbe performance and functionality, so, cheers, and excited to hear your future findings. B) Ha!  I use Remarkable 2 as well.  It&#39;s a great way to escape and just ... focus on stuff. The price of this makes the humane pin price seem reasonable 😂😂 The worst wallpaper design of all time lol It’s not a full computer Just got the S9+ (516 Gb) and i already have around 50Gb... 😂So I understand the 8tb concern Give me a break; you also have 18 million subscribers to pay for your iPad. The rest of us will say &quot;$3000 for a tablet, are you fucking crazy???&quot; That&#39;s the normal reaction <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=54\">0:54</a> Android 3, my favorite💖<br>I remember my old Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1″, it was such a cool tablet. It had 16GB of memory and could run GTA SA at a low but playable frame rate. Still it is an IOS and not a MacOS. ...because you have too much money? cool background really? you spend $3,600? Another gimmick, aren&#39;t you get tired of this? Only bought a base iPad for ,y girlfriend because she just wanted it for TikTok lol OMG the good excuses for this pad is crazy. Let&#39;s be real it&#39;s still can&#39;t do what laptops do. To expensive for what it does.   But seems like because it&#39;s Apple The criticisms are minor. Please Review moto edge 50 pro The review made it sound pretty damn good.  Still not buying one though.<br>Apple sux 😁 The file system might become a nightmare. I hate files and folders in ipad. Would kill me with all the files i need This guy is becoming the Apple shill day by day. iGlad am Still watching this on my 2018 iPad Pro, and it works great (until they decide to not support it anymore) This sounds like all the perks of a surface tablet. I use the iPad Pro for shapr3d, it’s why I bought an iPad Pro (13inch) still the screen is too small and cluttered. Wondering about the Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Fold (16.3inch). Why did you have to suck on that tooth brush like that?? lol It’s $2,600 for a fulled loaded iPad Pro with 13” screen , 2TB, nano glass, &amp; cellular.  Who ripped him off?!?!? intersting new set 👌👌 nononono... when a product tells me I have to install an app, rather than use a website, I don&#39;t use that company. Half of these apps only exist to track you and sell your data to advertisers.<br><br>I shouldn&#39;t have to bloat my phone out with a million stupid apps to buy a t-shirt or look at a menu, or read an article. Stop making me sign up for stuff and install stuff. Just give me a website.<br><br>Websites work on every device, and if you need an account, you can use your account on every device you have. Apps are a pain in the butt. Took them a M4 chip to enable short cut function let&#39;s lmao Wanna be Surface/ 2-1s cuz they effed up This is the same thing with the apple vision pro when everyone thought that it would replace phones😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀 Video should be titled how apple always steal my money😂 just get a high end pc/laptop with a drawing pad... why you bought this. the simple answer is you are so rich, man. M4 is unnecessary and would help Apple to pick up sale. And it is a tax write off All they had to do was just make a removable MacBook screen that was touch screen How to waste ur money: I hate Apple 🍎 I can&#39;t stand being stuck having to buy accessories in the same environment 😒 unlike Android that is simple you can mix match brands and there isn&#39;t a problem with connectivity it just works This SCREAMS paid AD! <br>I can&#39;t trust nothing he says as his own genuine views! 11inch pro for fun and Mac Pro for work <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=972\">16:12</a> He’s not married yet and his dad jokes are already starting to show up. Just letting Arun know I would&#39;ve clicked on this video even before he changed the title to &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4&quot; To make this video and earn from it. Looks like Apple don&#39;t want you to build a iPhone now they have 19mil subs....I honestly believe you only said it for subs and we will never see the build now your on 18mil subs Finally you can have iphone, Macbook and iPad all in one device, add a pencil and Googlesung is in trouble. My $800 2020 iPad Pro has literally become a glorified YouTube watching device after the first week I got it. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=20\">0:20</a> you can convert it to INR too otw your views ‘ll. Yeah it looks like there&#39;s absolutely no sense in purchasing anything that is... It&#39;s just overprise just cause they could do it.... Absolute trash.. ‘Like’ He justified iOS without even talking about the Multitasking and notification mess. What a dumbo What a waste of money... So frosted glass costs $2000k? I can buy semi transparent matte for next to nothing. Apple is really going nuts, literally. Sorry. but tablets will always be nothing more than huge phones to me. I’ve been using my M1 iPad Pro for 2yrs now… it’s actually my main device now… I’ve got an M1 MacBook Pro, which I hardly use… I just wish apple gives us Pro style apps with the exact same functionality as found on MacOS… not skimming. I can live with ipadOS… just give me a full version of Logic Pro on my iPad. nothing here other than incremental improvements. are you going to spend another $3600 when the next tablet is lighter, thinner, and faster? as for laptop vs tablet; you clearly don&#39;t need the functionality of a laptop but this doesn&#39;t mean an ipad is better. All i hear is &quot; we took everything samsung has been doing and decided to do it ourselves finally&quot; I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one who would say that their parents don&#39;t want them watching youtubers who cuss Apple don&#39;t care. They know there&#39;s a queue of idiots willing to spend that kind of money on a pad. Let the fools spend.... Welcome to the Apple storage game. They can just as easily provide an sdxc slot but wont. They can kiss my bass. This is hardly the first YouTuber saying an iPad can replace a laptop. Ever since the M1 iPad, or maybe even earlier, YouTubers have been saying that the iPad Pro is just as powerful if not more powerful than some laptop computers. But guess what, It been almost 4 years since the release of the M1 iPad, and still the same old song. The problem was never about the hardware, you can put supercomputer chip inside, as long as it still runs iPadOS, its still nothing more than a toy for most people. &quot;apple&#39;s thinnest product&quot;<br>polishing cloth left the chat Everyone in med school uses tablets That iglad made me chuckle 😂 that toothbrush shot tho lol susss Youre not tricking any of us to buy that garbage cuhh🗣️🗣️ As an iPad Pro user, the Galaxy Tab Ultra feels more advanced design wise bc it already has an OLED screen, thin body, but also has much slimmer bezels DONT DO THE NANO COATING! THE BLACKS ARE NOT AS DEEP AND YOU LOOSE SHARPNESS! ALSO VERY HARD TO TAKE CARE OF! The answer to why is because you&#39;re a millionaire and can. Productivity apps unfortunately really suck on iPad. Notion’s app, for example, is abysmal. I get everything I need out of my s9 FE. I couldn&#39;t imagine spending that kind of money on a tablet, regardless of the performance upgrade. Next thing you know, you&#39;ll see some random 5-10 yr old decked out with an iPhone 50 pro max, air pods, and the new iPad, I guess. Replacing a laptop (in this case MacBook) for a tablet (in this case iPad) ... yeaaahh... no. benchmarks got leaked And 99% of people watching this cannot drop £3k on a tablet. or take one samsung galaxy 4 book 360  and samsung galaxy s14 ultra i like my ipad 9th gen. does what i need it to! Fellas, is it apple’s fault that you use it only to watch Netflix and YouTube ? Specifically when you could’ve got the cheaper 400$ one ? Dog I JUST BOUGHT the M2 a year ago when it was the hottest shit and they’re at M4 now? Lmao get out What is the writing tablet he’s comparing it to? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=199\">3:19</a> Remarkable 2 thoughts:<br>Yes its thin but whit a case its not, nobody use this without protection<br><br>With the magic keybord you cant use it as an ipad anymore I was somewhat underwhelmed by the iPad reveal meanwhile you spend $3600 on it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">00:43</a> ... 🤨🤨🤨 You are right, they are not just big phones, they are a BIGGER phone So what can it do that my iPad 5th gen can&#39;t? I use my iPad a lot for daily work but it&#39;s really old now, I don&#39;t want to drop $3600 on a new one Tablet = Smart Plate M1 MAX still good for my iPad🗿 Never buy Apple.. stop being a sheep. Because youre an apple fan boy.... Considering using a tablet as a laptop is just stupid!... even more with the actual iPad OS system... what a wanker! 8 fucking terabytes?!? bro, get off Torrent sites lol Im guessing the answer is &quot;Because I can make a video on it, write it off on my taxes as a business expense, amd monetize the video.&quot; it 100% wont replace your macbook Couldn’t agree with you more I’ve been using my 10.5 inch iPad Pro for 7 years every day all day cost $729 still runs excellent still can get the latest updates in software. Never had an issue with any problem one button touch and it’s on. <br><br>Ordered the 11 inch iPad Pro because Apple is giving me $100 trade-in plus I get another 10% education discount so the new ones only costing $800. Although my iPad Pro still works great and battery is still good figured it’s about time to give it a rest and take advantage of $100 trade-in. <br><br>I also purchased the logic tech keyboard case combo from Apple because that’s the only place you can get it right now for $229 just delivered today really nice case. light up keyboard, function keys, and a huge trackpad, but weighs practically nothing and you can just pull it apart from the magnet if you don’t need a keyboard. Had a similar case for my old iPad and it still works great never had an issue. Protected my iPad from a few drops. All these screens devices just do the samethings at this point. This is might just be an unpopular opinion, but with inflation and everything that is going on; I don’t think $3000 is a good price for a tablet that still runs on an iPad OS worth it. Especially when Apple keeps coming out with all these different processors and it barely touches what can be done on the current OS and telling people that it’s made for creators. Also, all these advancements in hardware but we have a QuickTime bug when we export footage. How is this still a thing when you’re spending so much money on a device built for “creative expression”. How is an iPad Pro M4 more expensive than an iPhone 15 Pro Max You’re about to make me make a bad financial decision Absence of Instagram app for iPad invalidates its appeal and price :( I don&#39;t think the iPad or any tab can anytime match a laptop use case. Atleast for my use cases. It&#39;s really cool to have this much power but it&#39;s useless if I can&#39;t run certain software or platforms on it. I currently use a mid Samsung tablet and I love the ease of using with my phone and connected features and a good windows laptop which allows to run major software, and costs less than the iPad itself even without considering the folio case and pencil lol. That toothbrush shot was crazy bruv Yea no bro. This product is for you and you only lol 10 years before an iPad feels useful?  That’s not saying much about Apple’s priorities.  The problem has always been the software. I think the speakers are going to be terrible Just ordered with the nano screen Why? Cause you&#39;re a hardcore Apple fan duh? Apple pricing is just on a different level You definitely don&#39;t get more gaming utility from an iPad. You&#39;ll find that out once you have it. Please go and tryout the Microsoft surface pro tablet<br>Never use my iPad after buying a Microsoft surface pro it&#39;s insane<br>Buy the pro version Not the go version or the RT version their is a difference There is absolutely no valid reason to spend 3600$ on an iPad. You have money and you are dumb, that&#39;s it ! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=537\">8:57</a> lol same, on my S23 ultra Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4. Answer: 18.5 million subscribers. Perfect for writing down ideas in a coffee shop, GEEEE 4 *   (GEEE means M). i’ll shell out the money when i can code on it 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ until then all this power is super meaningless like i’m not paying for an infinitesimally faster youtube screen This was a really good video, I watched MKBHD’s one and it was good, but this just gives such a good insight into what this iPad could mean for its target audience What’s $3600 to a millionaire I cannot understand why the hell people use macbooks when you can just install linux on a high end laptop for less than half the price. No the one main advantage that PC still has is that it is not a mac.. smh. CLICKBAIT , he doesn’t have it guys 😂 I feel like you’re spending, $3,300 worth of this iPad just for a pencil …..literally …a pencil<br><br>Sure you can play games, <br><br>But… so can my Xbox or PlayStation 5, my point is for some of this technology, I believe will be replaced by cloud computing in the future and what your left buying is a glorified screen for $3,300!!!<br> <br><br>it’s all good though somebody’s got to spend the money :/ i&#39;m just waiting for a time when the iPad and macbook are both ditched to bring out a hybrid which are better than both the Macbook and the iPad. The fact the matter is this you have over 18 million subscribers you&#39;re making a lot of money through YouTube. You can afford to buy the top range iPad use it for a while and if you don&#39;t like it return it. And if you don&#39;t like it send it to me LOL😂 You spend it to get 2.4M views 😂 hey Arun can i please have your old mac? please? At this rate Apple will release a Starbucks look a like Coffee Mug that connects with your phone and apple watch, yet people will still buy it for the price Them Cupertino boys done impressing Arun-bhai! 😃<br>Jokes aside - personally, as an owner of a recent iPad Pro (with the M-series chip), this seems an evolutionary step and likely wait for a generation or two for the OLED technology to evolve on Apple devices. So from that perspective, I am more in agreement with MKBHDs impressions in his &quot;awkward&quot; video especially considering the artificial software limitations due to iPadOS (versus an M-series Macbook Pro with MacOS) . <br>But if this is a first iPad Pro, this might not be a bad place to start. The real thing about it is iPad does not work like a computer. And you will not be able to use Adobe Creative Suite on it or do any hardcore computer work. Because apple does not allow that kind of freedom as a MacBook. So basically if you are paying over $3,000 for an iPad expect an iPad functionality. Unless Apple will finally give you the ability to use the full power of the iPad and be able to install computer programs to do your work. But of course they would never do that because they&#39;ll lose their computer Market Still...&quot;No Dual USB-C&#39;S &quot; With All That Power...<br>Guess What... Lenovo Legion Y700 2023 8.8 inch Gaming Android Tablet has Dual USB-C&#39;S...<br>🤯🧐🤓🥸😎...<br>Look it Up...<br>🤣 “Using it is crazy similar to a Mac”…unless you want to do anything a laptop can do other than use the web. It’s great hardware, just a terrible terrible OS Boy is he signing himself up to get disappointed. Apple&#39;s line up is truly messy. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s on purpose, but for instance just look at the apple pencil bs. 4 different versions. old apple pencils don&#39;t work with new ipads and vice versa. It is a mobile device. Mobile devices are seen by industry as consumer devices not productivity devices. They will never ever, ever be on par with computers. I wish they could, I genuinely wish we could ditch laptops but sadly ipados ios android they all suffer from being a dumbed down version of a computer. In fact this video just looks like an ad for ipad.... The amount of anti-Apple vitriol in these comments is… something. Honestly I think companies trying to make things thinner and thinner is dumb. That&#39;s just sacrificing how strong it is and making it easier to break. It&#39;s just not practical So.....<br>Just another tablet The next video is iPad Pro Vs Tab s9 Ultra🤣🤣🤣 imagine everything they had to crush to build those ipads I can&#39;t wait to buy one of these for what they&#39;re actually worth in 12 years. you are mandate to specify if this is a affiliated video.. showing that apple paid you Because u have more money then sense u mupet Apple paid good money for this video i love that he basically described a surface.<br>that thing even with apple M60 will still be an Ipad because despite what we think, it still relies on IpadOS and the appstore. so you can&#39;t instal anything else.<br>basically an ipad.<br>overkilled on top of that.<br>throw a paperlike onto your windows 11 surface and that&#39;s it you got it a PC that you can take notes with paper feeling, you can watch youtube to cook you latest recipe, and you can use any software ever, and thanks to intel unisson since windows 11 you can get you iphone texts and message people on you tablete 2 in 1.<br>perks, you can game with a Egpu plugged onto it for the price of the magic keyboard hahaha I read there could be a MacOS Lite for the iPad 🤷\\u200d♂️. All the other leaks were correct another reviewer who misses the point… for what u have described, just get the ipad air and keep your macbook… I  guess the ipad that I use daily will be my last one.  My ipad is a luxuary, not a requirement for me so, a new one has to be priced like a toy,ie., less than a thousand dollars or I won’t buy it. Overpriced garbaged Normally 1000 tho <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=946\">15:46</a> why don’t you have a personal server at home yet? you could have your own dedicated 200 terabyte server at home without needing to worry about cloud services or storage on your devices, all while being synced all the time. Also you can access your own server from any device with any o.s. <br><br>Seems kinda weird that you need terabytes of storage but don’t have your own server lol That&#39;s a lot of freaking money to spend on a toy.  Let them do it. Could you throw it away, please? Wait.. Does MAC even have games??? ROFL.. come on man... Gaming and mac??!?! Sorry.. my British.,.. but BOLLOCKS mate! News flash for you: You still live in a PC driven world my dude... Macs are a niche for the people that have no idea what they talk about but want to look &quot;cool&quot;, like it has always been... &quot;You don&#39;t even buy the whole Apple&quot;... I will stop with my comments here :) Good attempt at a video.. (Look at M$ vs 3 quarters of an apple &quot;valuation&quot; to see this a bit more clearer...) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> 💀💀 thanks you dont need any of em, you just can afford them. May i ask  what that writing pad was? iPads are significantly more limited than computers and honestly at this point, more by design and less by hardware. Most software wont run or isnt optimzied for touch and besides, still cant run IDEs or any real compilers on the iPad, making it an overpriced drawing tablet and youtube viewer. Old joke but still true.<br><br>Hope the future changes it, because it has a ton of potential. I bought one, it was like $1199. Did you get 10TB of storage? Apple should open it up to MacOS, it would make so much sense, but that will never happen. Just for fun i checked the website and the prices for add ons. This is really the most greedy company in history Title: Why I spent $3600 on ipad Pro m4.<br><br>Me: Because you can afford it Coz he will make lot more money from this video. I still don’t see a point why anyone would spend that much money just to watch videos and light internet. iPad or iPad Air will do. I think this video is just so much misleading @@vga19he needs content man \\u200b@@vga19feel more like a sponsored video. @@Roadside121by who? why would apple want you to get an iPad over a MacBook? \\u200b@@SoosRamirez1because they want them to buy both. cos the money generated from this clickbaity horseshit is greater than the cost to purchase the overpriced tablet @@SoosRamirez1 he can earn alot more from views. So the cost of buying the tablet is petty money . @@Roadside121 what does that have to do with my question I see a bit of sweetening for Apple, it smells a bit like a sponsored video ;) 3600 for an ipad is nasty work &quot;Why I spent $3600&quot;<br>The Answer: Because you could. Bro are you on drugs? 🤣🤣 The same price as the Apple Vision Pro 💀 To have something for yet another video. Yeah. You didn’t sell me on this.  I thought you would have BEST OF ALL it&#39;s probably impossible to repair so they probably love that it could replace your laptop. YAY DISPOSABILITY I will never switch to an iPad, I prefer my MacBook Air wayyyy more Which e-ink device is that? BUT ITS SO THIN YOU GUYS Ipad pro with geforce now and a ps5 controller playing apex legends plz there is our biggest apple fanboy of the whole internet throwing all his money on an overpriced tablet!☠️ Comparing it with other tablets is not really a fair comparison when Android tablets have drastically worse chips @@bullishlucas yes but its to 100% not worth that amount of money @@chopstick134 The 3600, no, but base price is 1100-1300 @@bullishlucas i got my samsung for 550 and free watch. also with ipad you have to buy pencil cover too actually apples Apple TV remote is thinner I have been using Ipad Pro M1 for more than 3 years with Magic Keyboard<br>, and iPad Pro until now will never replace MacBook!! This makes me want to get the M2 iPad Air considering how much cheaper and overpowered the M2 still is Ipad is pointless. Only use is as a kindle or video player... $3k for a portable large screen Don’t do it!! It won’t work. Because you like burning/ flaunting money like money other YouTubers? Samsung&#39;s tablets are using phone chips... Okay ? You can play full on Cyberpunk 2077 on the 8 gen 3, you&#39;ll be fine with that kind of power don&#39;t worry Pretty much a paperweight. Of course when you have infinite funds you can spend it on whatever without worry. Everyone just want apple to make a Surface Pro. The answer is obvious - it’s because you have nearly 20 million subscribers and therefore earn enough money to buy damn near anything you want. 👏 👏 Don&#39;t waste your money! Lol see his excitement go down the drain on WWDC, not to mention his 3 grand :&#39;) What’s the new game on the iPad? Looks like a cool game. Still not a Mac. you know its bad when the ipad costs more then the vision pro. like thats mad Well I am not in market for new iPad Pro. Crazy money for a tablet…..Yes it maybe brilliant but as I have a perfectly good iPad Pro see zero reason to update. Let’s face it most people dont use their phones or ipad or even computers to their max. We love having the fastest best screen lightest you name it but we only utilise a small percentage of their true capacity. We buy into the hype because it sounds like we can be part of the cool crowd sitting in a coffee shop playing with our gadgets and become the next top cat this ipad is more expensive than the APPLE VISION PRO The only reason why its $3600 Is because he chose the most expensive options Thanks for going all in on the options so we feel smart not getting it. Amazing video as always. Love your content bro!! Tablets make phones inferior. My phone is good when I’m out. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=601\">10:01</a> i will resume later Small correction:  Google docs and slides are not great on IPad and specifically lack features for full time work use.  I often have to do tricks to get documents to open in Safari instead of the apps to access certain functions.  It’s a longstanding problem IMO. I don&#39;t understand why the M4 ipad is supposed to be 50% slower than an m1/m2 macbook. It makes no sense Ipad are also historically champions of longevity. You can mostly still use a 7 years-old iPad comfortably, even though battery life is terrible, for obvious reasons. So yes, I think the prices are justified given that you can keep it for 5+ years and use it everywhere - it’s £60 a month! OR you can just buy a much cheaper laptop and also use it 7+ years. Probably better to wait until you have the device before making the video? Bit of a weird one... I don&#39;t care how good it is, paying that much for a tablet is insane. But if you got it like that, keep shining 😊 Wow, I just thought about that. That you cannot get 5G on laptop, but you can’t find iPad. Honestly, with this kind of power, it&#39;s not a tablet anymore. It&#39;s a competitor to a Microsoft Surface. simple question why you buy it :D I go on tirades this long when &quot;hovering over the buy button&quot; too but unfortunately it&#39;s my poor spouse who has to listen instead of 18.5M subscribers 😂 I feel like this whole video was just him convincing himself it&#39;s okay to spend that much. He bought it for his job. Then made a video acting as if he didn&#39;t. Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4. Because it was worst and pointles to show how big is your ..... Secondly still apple has worst keyboard case ever. Secondly why they still not let to change curstor on iPadOS? Still too small. More power is completely uselss, IPad pro 2017 does everything I need. IPad Pro 16&#39; when? I don&#39;t want to carry around a $4000 piece of glass, but I guess I&#39;m just a broke boy. Yeah, Apple knew that the moment they allow iPad to boot MacOS, the Macbook sales will go down significantly. And they don’t want that😊 Agree bro If I even had the money to buy one, I’d rather take a used car.<br>It’s infuriating that even the keyboard is that expensive. I have an iPhone and will definitely switch back to android if it’s broken. You can&#39;t say you&#39;d rather game on a tablet than a computer if you only gamed on Mac Pro 💀 You’ll switch back to the macbook in like 2 days. iPad OS is dumb on ipad using youtube in safari desktop mode is much much much much better than the youtube ipad os app The fact that I just paid 1300 for a new iPad pro 12.9inch and apple pencil a few months ago feels like a slap in the face honestly but I&#39;m not gone upgrade and it was a huge investment to my business. This is wild hardware is amazing but iOS sucks. total rip off. Wait the iPad is HOW much!? Lmaooooo I have a last gen iPad Pro (I use for art and sometimes for streaming) a MacBook for music production and a PC for gaming, $3600 can buy two of those three things and get you soooo much further in doing literally anything. Apple is out of their minds these days I swear Capitalism is broken. I hope the ipad mini 7 pro will have 120 hz and will be compatible with the apple pencil pro. It would make sense. I bought a slightly used/like new 13 inch Ipad Pro 2020 with magic keyboard and it was great and I used it everyday. But after playing a mobile game for awhile it burned the back of the screen leaving it permanently discolored. Luckily it was on the edge of the screen and i for the most part not noticeable unless staring directly at it. The keyboard started rip it’s outer cover after about 3 years of use. Also the screen fell off because the double sided tape they used to keep it attached melted. The microphone also randomly stopped working. This tablet+keyboard with pen originally cost around $2k and I spent around $1200 on a lightly used model. Cuz you&#39;re a tech content creator, &amp; your job is to review stuff? couple of years ago i bought an ipad air 5th gen. my son still rocks with his learning videos while i do my work on PC. spent lot of $$$ but didn&#39;t use it. LOL 😁😁😁😁 I disagree with apples power management. If the battery health degrades to a certain degree, the device will no longer work at all. As an example, this is unsafe for anyone using it for flight navigation. The devices need to work when plugged in, regardless of battery health. Sadly, apple laptops are the same. Apple&#39;s ad crushed it. Didn&#39;t think I had principles until I watched that. <br>It&#39;s saved me thousands. Be real dude<br>The simple answer to why I got the new iPad is - I’m rich, I can afford it, that’s it. that tooth brushing looked a lil sus lol &quot;Movies are much better on a small phone screen than a big screen&quot;<br><br>......bruh, what a shill مين جا من فيديو اسئلة (دراغونوف)😂<br><br>سؤال مين يوتيوبرك المفضل If you will stop using your remarkable 2 I would love to have it. It would be usefull into school :DDD I never bought anything apple and never will. Something new that&#39;s thin and light just to have everyone put a thick ass case on it. Because you are richer than you can handle. so how many fps for cyberpunk? if you paying 4k for something with a CPU, it better run cyberpunk at 120fps minimum Software wise, the IPad is not going to replace a laptop.

You have a comfortable, storytelling manner and are an orator of the highest order. Not Orson Wells great but outstanding in your own right. I never catch myself thinking, &quot;Is he done, yet?&quot;<br><br>Keep up the good work. Feel exactly the same way Most people buy these stuff to flex. Apple people like to look like they are productive with their tech. They are mostly using these stuff for YouTube, Netflix, Minor photo edit and writing useless notes. Real engineers, architects, programmers, video editors carry powerful Windows gaming PCs. Make video about quantum computing and explain how quantum computers work and also their benefits in modern technology , because nowadays quantum computing potential and its hype is rises day by day at internet. I’ll stick with my 2020 iPad Pro, which still does everything I (and probably 95% of users) want to do. I bought the last ones that came out. Not worth it. In the slightest. Before you receive the iPad u will get the amount for iPad to purchase great strategy Me watching it on the iPad 9 😭 The first apple foldable The Apple pencil (Gen 2) does have a hidden touch button. I so far am confused if it&#39;s still there or if they replaced it with the squeeze...<br><br>But that touch button is the main way you change between draw/eraser. The pro pencil still has the double tap feature <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=778\">12:58</a> What game is this? Thanks in advance. Because, you need content The ultimate skibidi toilet viewing device /j Do a video bout the gadgets you use mfana mahn like mentioned on this video “Very heavy laptop” I have a macbook pro m2 but I rarely use it because all I need is my iphone 15 pro.. sharing and editing on apps is so seamless and convenient these days. The screens and speakers are really good too for the size. But maybe it&#39;s just because I don&#39;t have a desk and I&#39;m currently living in a tiny room Me watching this on the tab s9 ultra. Which has basically replaced all my computer usage I may just get a generic stand if I get his iPad and use my Mac&#39;s keyboard instead when I swipe over with my trackpad since I do that with my current iPad after Apple&#39;s own keyboard stand broke on me. Maybe I&#39;m weird but I keep thinking at this rate, why note make the iPad be able to dual boot iOS and MacOS. Have the option to run MacOS when the iPad is hooked up with a keyboard, run iOS when standalone. If you do not use your laptop. Let me get it for school. Why are companies still making and people buying devices with square and sharp edges! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=60\">1:00</a> a phone is still small versus a 10-14 inch tablet people heavily tend to forget how power hungry AI is. Unless it is really a big upgrade, it is usually not worth it. Video enhancement is a good example. Cool you can enhance youtube videos a bit, but it comes at a hefty power cost and negligible image improvements. In video games, it is another discussion. But the irony is , that you only really need good AI if you are low on processing power already. <br><br>If you wanna run all kinds of AI functionality your system is gonna consume alot of power :)<br><br>Honestly. For personal use, I havent really seen it make any tangible difference. Maybe creating art is pretty cool, but the models are so stupid atm it feels like talking to a robot from the 60s.<br><br>All kinds of business use is viable, but I have yet to recognize a single use case for peoples everyday lives. the way you brushed had me concerning This dude is the biggest apple shill, they announce a new screen and a new chip, and now he’s realizing that the iPad can replace laptops for productivity, and the current iPad lineup literally does everything the new one does minus the pencil gyro thing which is a very niche use, Ive been using the iPad Pro for my university notes for 3 years now and I basically have my money’s worth, so the same old M1 ipad is still better value, the only thing I would say is good about the new iPad is how light it is, which helps for a campus dweller but the iPad air might be the better option in that case. Got rid of my laptop years ago. Got a MacBook and took it back. Now use my iPad with cellular all the time. Most useless Apple products:<br>Ipad<br>Iwatch<br>Apple vision pro Who else watching this on their IPad?😂 That tooth brush clip look weird In short. I did it so I could make this video When photoshop has all of the features of their desktop version, I can see myself making the switch. Artifitially limited*: yeah, iPadOS its way limited. Im still not able to format any drive, something that android tablets do since android kitkat. Its a beautiful piace of tech that is not going to cannibalize the macbook, and thats the big problem. I don’t even have to watch this. You spent it to make a video about it that pays for it. So he sat there from daylight to moonlight told us all about The iPad while just hovering over that buy button. because you can afford it porbably Review video of convincing yourself to buy a 1600USD tablet xD I would prefer a tab s9 cs i prefer the android OS and its like half the price <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=540\">9:00</a> wait till you see instagram on iPad 🤪🤪🤪 why?

It still functions so beautifully! <br>But if I were to upgrade now, I would upgrade to the iPad Air, especially now that it comes in a 13 inch size. I don’t think there’s any reason to get the Pro unless you need that specifically for your occupation My car was $1700 CAD 3600? apple is gettin ridiculous about prices... people start to get tired of these jokes... MArcus said it right, it can&#39;t do anything, the software just isn&#39;t there... I use my Ipad pro 2019 for art and 3d modelling when I don&#39;t want to sit at a desk but it still doesn&#39;t fit the bill for actual work machine Why? Coz you make a living reviewing stuff but, can it do Excel ? $3,600 is INSANE Tbh I&#39;d never buy an ipad, just because of the os and the apple ecosystem. I&#39;ve bought Samsung tab s6 lite &#39;22 for 300€ and I am using it for notes and even programming in school, when I don&#39;t want to bring my laptop, and it&#39;s amazing. The performance is acceptable, besides some stutters (it is a budget to mid-end device after all). <br>So I really don&#39;t think that average person would ever need such tablet, even as a replacement of a laptop. Arun: I am a 8TB guy<br>Me who&#39;s watching this on my 256Giggs MacM1 🥲 Answer: You wanted to make content by talking about it... jesus I wish Apple people would start saying &quot;no&quot; to these new insanely priced products. These new tablets bait. Do browsers on ipad have the same extensions as the ones on mac? Can you use bookmarklets on them? Understandably this guy has a tech channel, but the reality is he’s going to be surely disappointed because  iPad OS. This new M4 and do the M1 as well without breaking the bank. There is realistically no need for this iPad to exist until the iPad gets MacBook treatment with its software. I bought into the idea of them iPad replacing my laptop and even without the keyboard there is plenty of stuff a regular iPad Air or an iPad Pro from 2020 will replace the laptop for, but it doesn’t need to be the highest one to this frankly, you’ll never use half of it. do what I do and plug your iPad to a raspberry pi 4 if you really want “desktop replacement” even then I doubt most people would like a terminal. It finna fold from a drop i actually do everything on my Samsung smartphone (watch tv, play games, working, editing, documents, etc). I just use my laptop for protocol exclusive use, a lot of windows tools and services are still required to work. Huawei 13.2 inch Tablet are more way next level then ipad pro ,plus Huawei got free Pencil. Apple no😂💀 That is an obscene amount of money to pay for a tablet BUT i will buy it anyways. Thanks Arun! 8TB on a MacBook Pro is insane to me 😂😂😂 I think 1TB would be fine w me but hey what do I know I don&#39;t even own a MacBook Pro 😂😂😂 maybe one day I&#39;ll save enough for one... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=881\">14:41</a> <br>This has such great memeing potential Why ? because you are looking for views to line up your pockets. I replaced my pc in 2018. I have an iPad mini 6 and Im more then satisfied watching this video on my 1000 dollar pc which is cheaper 3 times in price and faster 100 times in power One problem...it&#39;s a apple.<br>Never again Talk what you want but $3,600 for a tablet is ridiculous. I will buy 2 rtx 4090 in this price Pro Software sucks on ipad os it,s still limited with ipad OS, not worth the money, older iPads Pro do the same I think Apple should make a Final Cut Pro iOS Editing App for the iPhone and iPhone Pro. Seriously, you were able to fill 16 minutes with info about this... ?  You coud have stopped immedately after $3600. Everything after that was irrelevant. Bought an Ipad 1,5 year ago and i do regret it. I use it for school mostly, but apps like Word and Excell aren&#39;t optmized well enough. I still need a laptop do to basic stuff in word.... It&#39;s not ideal if you go to school. Working in environments like Teams, aren&#39;t that great aswell.. I can&#39;t create documents inside the app to share with group members ect. It still lacks alot of functions. Despite waiting for 1,5 year now, it&#39;s not ideal for me. Great video, thank you and have fun with the IPad. We need folks to do a durability and a real world test, like when a toddler sits and walks over it. this happens when every new iPad comes out - every creator makes a &quot;this will replace my Mac&quot; video... until iPadOS get better you are not replacing your Mac... you are going to buy the iPad make a few youtube videos then return it. Apple sheep being a programmer I think that I would never be able to switch to iPad.<br>But for every other person I think that it will be possible pretty soon The reason for such a drop off in iPad sales was their durability. They were future-proofed so much that there was little need to buy a new one every two or three years. There is less reason to upgrade your iPad compared to a phone, because they aren’t where your point and shoot camera resides. I’ve just pulled the trigger on a new iPad Pro, six years after buying the 2018 model. Not because I wanted the latest and greatest, but because I wanted to pass down this iPad, which still works really well, and get myself a new one that will keep me ahead of things for several years. There is less need to purchase iPads when they just keep going. Mine is primarily for drawing and design work, which there is no substitute for in my book. 3600 dollars? Damn, fuck that.<br><br>You said it, it is obscene.<br><br>This will face the same criticism as the  super thin macbook from back in the day.<br><br>Apple, instead of working on actual problems like the battery and the lack of ports, instead they add features that aren’t necessary. Why? Because you have 18 Million subs ... what a nice ad to watch.<br>The iPad will never be a Laptop replacement in its form these days. Yes, the hardware specs are impressive and if its only about this, its possible- BUT, since this thing still runs iPadOS ... how are you gonna replace a desktop os with a tablet, when the tablet still runs a &quot;lite os&quot;.<br>The only thing these iPads lack is MacOS ... To make a video 🤷 I gave up on the iPad when I was in college and I needed to load a website just to get “Not compatible with Mobile browsers” 😵… I’ll keep my M3 MB Air, iPhone 14PM and just add the M2/M3 iPad Air if the new iOS is worth the upgrade🤷🏾 1, because you already made that money back posting this video 2. you&#39;re a multi millionaire 3. its a tax write off for your business.. so yeah you spent 3.6k bc its negligible I love watching movies so I prefer the S9 over this one. This one is just garbage. Few are for work. Just take a PC if you are looking for something good for work. When is the screen of the iPad going to look like the Samsung tablets? Those things are elite. If it can run premiere pro with the power of my pc I might consider jumping ship Both suck compared to Windows Laptop or  Handheld LMAO Obviously, give the iPad the ability to run MacOS or Windows, and you’d see pretty easily spank a majority of handhelds and laptops. @@theramennoodler7950 that&#39;s the whole point dude <br>It&#39;s like giving Z1 extreme the efficiency of M3 <br>You can&#39;t.

I see the appeal, I’m in art school in graphic design and I have a friend who categorically refuses to use a mac, he’s fine with ipads tho. He specialises in illustration and for him an ipad was game changing, he drew like 3 times more and better. The crazy expensive ipad from the video is the crazy maxed out one, nobody needs that i agree, but a 1500-2000€ ipad is completely acceptable. Why ? just look at the premium graphic tablets prices, it is outrageous for just a “screened trackpad” and ipad is very similar in drawing capabilities, does way more than juste being a graphic tablet, and is cheaper. its come to the point where apple is just like designer clothes. people just buy it for the apple tag and to look rich. there are so many tablets that are even better and below 1k dolalrs @@dada.yoshiki Dont forget after 5 years when the battery is degraded you cant use the ipad work outside. Unlike the macbook pro once the battery is dead you can still plugged it and use it as a worksation at home with multiple screens. Not to mention most apps in ipad os are subscription base.

Because, deep down, you know that purchasing this thing is not worthwhile, so you have to try to convince yourself out of it with a 16-minute video. I fell for the same thing with the previous model. After a year, I feel I have some advice to give to potential buyers. Keep in mind my perspective is that of somone who does content creation full time, edits 2-3 7min 4k videos daily and rarely leaves home. I also like having the latest most powerful devices even if they end up as paperweight in the end.<br><br>1. The ipad pro, this one or earlier models, will NOT replace your laptop<br>2. The export times on the ultra chips can´t be beaten<br>3. You will probably never use the pencil more than twice a month if that <br>4. The magic keyboard IS a must so always add that in when considering budget <br>5. It is a snappy piece of tech, but the apps (not even the pro ones) don&#39;t take full advantage of the chip<br>7. You have to buy a different license for Davinci on the ipad (and it often crashes)<br>6. I still use mine on an everyday basis, however exclusively for media consumption (youtube and crunchy)<br>7. I ended up buying a macbook in the end... <br><br>I feel the ipad pro only makes sense for people who for whatever reason can&#39;t own/use a laptop. If you do video for a living you can get by, but it will come with a lot of limitations which you&#39;ll encounter more often that you&#39;d like. I was told this countless times but I didn&#39;t listen because I love wasting money apparently: if you want an ipad GET THE AIR. It will end up working more than fine for the way you will inevitably end up using your ipad pro for; video consumption and in case you want to work on it with photo and video editing someday you actually can. I tried to go buy a new iPad then realized the only Apple product I can afford is apple juice… So 3 words: You bought it. There it is folks he made this video to get $$$ to buy the $3600 ipad 😂 The iPad is just awesome, but it’s like they build Disneyland in a prison. <br><br>The second you need to do any file management or device management, there are walls and roadblocks everywhere. There is a community devoted to work arounds, but you eventually give up. It’s just too painful. <br><br>And, you hate that you can’t have that amazing pencil pro and the touch capabilities. dude buys kitchen appliances that have no business running on android then tries to claim he&#39;s not usually like this Who cares about a thin iPad? We all put them in cases so is just a less powerful mac,with a touchscreen. In the next couple of months, please expect the title of this video: “I’m returning my M4 iPad, and here’s why.” <br><br>Tldr, it cannot replace your MacBook or any other computer, Apple won’t let it. <br><br>You are suffering from consumerism fueled fomo, my friend.

When u think he have a MacBook Pro with 8TB... 😂 Send it back We just gonna forget the windows surface exists? Not to take away from the video, but watching this reminded me of the Surface Pro series from Microsoft, switching between laptop and tablet, to have the best of both worlds. I would say the difference is that Microsoft wanted the Surface to be a laptop first and a tablet second, which made the tablet aspect of things clunky to use sometimes. and the Microsoft store didn&#39;t really have as much app support as the Android or Apple store.<br><br>It is interesting to see these companies converging on a similar idea, though. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if, in a few years, Apple discontinued the Mac and just replaced it with this exact concept of &#39;dual functionality&#39;. It would make financial sense as well; it would save them money, and they could charge more for it and any other additions to make a &#39;functional&#39; tablet Mac hybrid. &#39;Cuz you are insane?  Or money means nothing to you anymore? all they do is worthless as long as they dont put macos on it It&#39;s a glorified tablet. No tablet is worth £2000... Website &gt; App here. Apps can do too much in the background on a device. Even on Apple. When I see the price, the only reason I’m happy about is having apple … stocks 😂 you pay 3600, they get 3000 real income My mom used to say ipaid to ipad. Now i understand why That is insanely to much money for a Tablet, tell me again how apple is not just stealing? Trust me: once you have a cellular iPad, you&#39;ll never buy another Wi-Fi only model. You&#39;ll also curse Apple for not making a cellular enabled MacBook Pro. The convenience is a game changer. I had one tablet (a Samsung) back in 2017, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get one again. They&#39;re great for leisure, but I kept finding myself asking if it was worth it. My laptops have always served me better. @chuck7415. ---- Negativity about the iPad is so weird.  No one tech product meets everyone&#39;s needs of course.  But the fact that Apple sells an average of 30 billion dollars worth of iPads per year, it&#39;s obvious there is an enormous market for the devices.  By the way Google did an extremely poor job of taking advantage of the larger screens and early Android apps were just blown up phone apps.  Apple did a great job and today dominate the sales of tablets. @@bruxi78230 👍 why would anyone spend 2000 to 3600 dollars on an ipad when its just as expensive to buy a desktop that can do more.

CYA Apple, not even close This looks like a paid ads than typical honest MrWhoseTheBoss videos Nah, I can&#39;t get behind this one. Apple must of really paid you good money to get a over priced Netflix iPad. Crazy money for a average iPad that you could actually buy a whole computer Because the screen is bigger, that&#39;s the exact reason You&#39;ll realize when you get older and start needing to use reading glasses, you&#39;ll understand why you&#39;ll want to use an iPad over an iPhone. The shot of him using his toothbrush was completely unnecessary …. &quot;Small cars&quot; must be a hell of a lot cheaper in the UK. In the US 3600 will get you a 20-year-old Corolla with 250k on the odometer and the check engine light on. You are encouraging corporate greed by even reviewing it. No matter how you look at it, it is stupidly overpriced. How much did apple pay you? My issue with the iPad ecosystem is cost vs durability. The Magic Keyboard works great until it breaks after a year or two if you’re lucky and repair is pretty unrealistic with the copper tissue paper that makes up the wiring. Impatiently waiting for the next Ultra chip Mac Studio. If you asked iPad Pro owners what they want improved, thinner and lighter likely don&#39;t be high on that list.  What would be a popular request would be better software that takes advantage of Apple silicon. <br><br>If you&#39;re surprised by the usability of a tablet that just means the previous ones weren&#39;t great.

Because you have a tech channel and you consistently need new videos to upload. Isn’t that enough reason to buy one. Because with such a large audience those $3600 will be recovered in hours is not minutes. <br>After that with every view its just pure profit.<br>😂😂 Using my 5th gen 12,9 with Shapr3d. Just amazing machine. No plans to switch to M4. M1 is still super powerful for all my needs. I’m from Asia and I don’t understand you guys have GDP per capita like $50,000 and still say it’s very expensive thing when it’s like $1k-$2k. I thought the answer was &quot;because I&#39;m a Muppet&quot; Because it&#39;s the ultimate ipad and it&#39;s SUPER COOL - VIRTUALLY A MACBOOK PRO! BUY! BUY! BUY I&#39;m wandering what your impressions will be because i was given a free iPad with the purchase of a web app 4 years ago and i was thoroughly disappointed too learn the ipad couldn&#39;t even run the web app (because apple only allows &quot;skins&quot; of other web browsers on their tablets but the engine still uses Safari). I tried using it for work but all the apps are stripped down and buggier versions of computer apps. If you connect a keyboard to make it work a little better at that point you might as well have a laptop. Ultimately, because of the way Apple limits what is allowed on iOS the device ended up being nothing more than a decent way to consume media. So I&#39;ll put a cartoon on Netflix or YouTube for my kids when i need to distract them for a minute. But i rarely use it myself. guys, did anyone know how long he has been talking? his background is night time Ipad pro 12&quot; are the worst products because they still use ipad os. They are a computer, yet they are glorified phones. Time for them to use macos, otherwise I find them useless. $3300 for a glorified phone, which does not have any glamorous features other than recycled content, is asinine. You’ll be disappointed eventually, mark my words And it still has Ipad OS. lol Signed Ipad for a lucky sub. 🎉 Love your show btw. Much live 🫶. whats the name of the other table with ink screen? It&#39;s still a glorified bigger version of an iPhone. No M chip of this world can save the iPad from being useless, until Apple straight up puts MacOS or a derivative on it.<br><br>MacOS already can run iOS Apps, they would maybe need to work a bit more on compatibility and that&#39;s it.<br><br>Most people after a while of owning it will use it, if even that, as a media consumption machine.<br><br>It&#39;s also too big for a lot of iOS games, and not all games have controller support, so no... the iPad is not the best of both worlds.<br><br>I&#39;m sure there are UseCases where it would actually help someone out, but that&#39;s definitely a very niche user base. Probably for pen dependant jobs it might deliver. But I for example after graduation didn&#39;t use the pen except to sign documents a few times.<br><br>iPad external display support is also crap. Samsung with their Dex and Microsoft with their full WindowsOS on their Surface Pro devices, are just better alternatives.<br><br>Heck with Microsoft you have a whole arsenal of games available to you. With that kind of a budget, you might get a Surface Pro device + a good eGPU and you can do whatever with it.<br><br>If you really want an iPad, get an older Pro version or get an Air (to anyone looking for advice and having at least one braincell left to think)<br><br>Kinda funny though how good the Apple marketing is. People actually think it is a good idea to pay that amount of money for that useless thing... Problem with tablet is their OS. It&#39;s fundamentally different than a laptop has. So even if you have the same apps and computing power as on your laptop, I cannot be as productive with a tablet as their OS forces a different workflow on me, costing me time.<br><br>Also for simple tasks like you have a file in the cloud, let&#39;s say a pdf. I will make notes in this file using both devices. You would think that would be no issue at all, especially when I was using an apple laptop and I an iPad - with Google cloud, though. That stupid iPad kept saving new versions of the same file in the file system. So everytime I had to use the newest file that had been created without me wanting it. I wasn&#39;t able to get that fixed - the pdf app on iPad OS always would download a local copy and not mutate the original in the cloud.<br>Really annoying, especially if you use all apple products.<br><br>So, tablets will most likely be entertainment devices for me in the near future. That might be different in 5y, though. Who knows?<br><br>Edit: He points out the file system as it&#39;s main flaw as well.... What a coincidence 😂 Any none Apple user will be laughing hard at this one🤣🤣. at this point, people don&#39;t buy apple product because it is worth it or not , is it just like buying a Gucci or Luis Vuitton shirt.

That made me laugh😂 You’re the first tech reviewer who has pointed out the advantages of the iPad running iPadOS rather than MacOS whilst still considering it as a viable laptop replacement. I now understand why Apple still keeps making the iPad Pro I shook my head and laughed when Steve Jobs first said it, and I&#39;m still shaking my head and laughing. I could never consider an iPad as a computer replacement because what makes a computer a computer is the file system. I guess for the people who don&#39;t care about a file system, then yes, an iPad can replace a computer.

From the start There&#39;s a reason MacOS is designed for the clamshell notebook devices and not for the devices with multi-touch UI. And there is a reason It&#39;s an iPad and not the Mac. Target consumer is a layman, school- college guy, and even the working professionals who don&#39;t prefer complexity of the Mac and want the straightforward UI of iPad. And even if Apple design MacOS around multi-touch, it would only complex the device further, which is not what apple likes to do. In my humble opinion people demanding iPad to run Mac OS are simply lost and have no clue how Apple function. i know a apple paid promotion when i see one 😂 And here we go again, someone who never really used an iPad is trying to replace his MacBook. This will end in disappointment within 1 month of using it because iPadOS is barely usable. The iPad is good for just 3 things, writing, drawing, reading/media consumption.. everything else is a chore to do on it. Hi, great video!

You just can’t do on a tablet what you can do on a laptop. Hard to justify the price. i am sure apple is very happy with the title. sponsored? For decades now I have searched for that elusive one-device-to-rule-them-all, and after spending thousands of dollars on various &quot;hybrid&quot; devices I have come to the conclusion that no such device will ever exist. There will always be a trade-off to a dedicated laptop, tablet, and phone, and ultimately if your workflow requires all 3, then invest in good devices in each class. Trust me, the jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none hybrid device will always end up being a subpar experience. Hey Arun if you don&#39;t want that remarkable tablet i will gladly take it. Actually Apple wants to replace laptops with tablet so they can charge keyboards for extra $1000 price 😂😂😂😂😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Been using my 2020 iPad pro and been wishing and longing to see it able to support programming &amp; coding. Whats the point of having best specs but unutilized <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> editor did Arun dirty ☠️☠️😵\\u200d💫 🤣 👀☠️😲💀 I tried two times using only an iPad Pro as a full replacement, and both times I quit after a few weeks. iPadOS doesn&#39;t cut it, never will. They won&#39;t put MacOS we all know that, and therefore lies the biggest problem. If this thing had MacOS I&#39;d buy it right now. This is really really dumb. can you make a video explaining quantum data? Who cares bro apple products are for dummies. I would prefer a powerful pc than a fricking tablet that can be breaked easily this is why phone reviewers should stick to phones, waste of money for something that after 10 mins of use becomes an m1 chip and still has the shitty ios tablet software, and this is why you don&#39;t buy the newest shiny thing kids Bro uses a remarkable and is saying that he won&#39;t even look at Samsung tablet cause of their phone chips, cause you&#39;ll be able to do so much more on a laptop chip with zero cooling How did I missed the rick roll?!<br>can someone tell me, were it was? u can get smart 4k tv and a gaming pc with price paired up with a phone xd I think I&#39;m at the exact same point as you when it comes to Ipad, I need something better than a laptop and Ipad Pro fits the requirement.<br>That being said I honestly think that powerhouse M4 chip will remain under utilized because of ipad OS. Also the thinner body = Smaller battery, if Apple claims that its the same battery life,<br>it only mean the M4 is able to achieve more with less power, that immediately should be understood as bottleneck that apple has implanted over the weak OS. Why? Because you’re insanely rich and spending $3600 is nothing to you 😂 This iPad is my wedding budget 😊 Yep WHAHAHA Then maybe you should opt  for the Ipad... \\u200b@@unicornharry7995 you must be have a spending problem. iPads don’t argue back. @@RobsRemixesiPads can’t wash the dishes. Until then, I will stick to woman. \\u200b@RobsRemixes keep your personal problems to yourself, people can argue back😱 lol marriage ain’t worth it in 2024, rather invest that money @@zeusx6479 where? \\u200b@@zeusx6479 Ikr, also why should I waste money on rent, I could also cut costs on food, I could sell everything I have and invest that shit. I will now go sell this device and then sell my organs. The OS... that&#39;s the problem Okay but lots of iPad apps are still just iPhone apps that you have to zoom into. Yes iPad has a ton of apps and it’s not nearly as bad as it used to be. But some apps still are awful on iPad. Because you’re a millionaire nothing to be ashamed of! Lol BRO THATS NOT HOW U USE TOOTH BRUSH Software Development, I don&#39;t think an iPad can do at workflow. Why should this be the year of switch from MacBook to iPad? 1 cm smaller and 100 gr less weight? Or is it just the better screen? Almost every reason to switch could have been mentioned for the last iPad Pro Finally an iPad worth upgrading from my 12.9” 2020 iPad Pro, which I have been using as my primary device since then. Four years out of any tech these days is a win in my book. Since my Magic Keyboard and Pencil is four years old, I don’t feel so bad about having to upgrade. They both have just enough updates that make them worth it. My trade-in value just covers that cost. Can’t justify the 1T or 2T for my use though, 512K keeps it in a decent price range for a 4 year shelf life. Thanks for the convincing review. The system should be taken into account. MacBook doesn&#39;t support NTFS on default. But it can read and write on external devices with other softwares. <br>The place where my files stored are optional on MacBook. But this cannot be done on iPadOS. That means 2TB model is useless for the most people. Yeah, my guy, you are reaching on this one. Stop the nonsense, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m paying over 3k for an iPad. All the points you made are frivolous and one dimension. The video starts at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=240\">4:00</a> I just grabbed a ruler and my Ipad M1 Pro and it&#39;s 5.1MM, so what the hell is going on? TLDR!<br>Your episodes are becomming more like software... &quot;Bloadware-videos&quot; now. Get to the point man! Yeah... problem is iPadOS. If Apple doesn&#39;t do anythng besides &quot;AI AI AI&quot; for iPadOS, then no. This thing isn&#39;t even REMOTELY capable of replacing your MacBook, regardless of hardware. Can you compare the Tab S9 ultra with this? It&#39;s great, but I do really dislike installing so many apps for each different services, you end up with over a hundred different apps, sometimes for things you only use very occasionally bruh tablets have done this a long time ago I actually use the iPad Pro for work and I hate how limited it is by its OS. Some apps work fine, but the ones importatnt to me (MS Office, Google Meet and such) are mostly nerfed versions with significantly limited functionality and bizzare compatibility issues.<br>More processing power is literally the last thing I need. I hope this year&#39;s iPadOS brings something new to the table, because I&#39;m definitely not buying a MacBook just to handle professional text editing. wow <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> that got me off guard 💀💀 An Ipad pro creates the illusion of productivity and at the end is just a big phone when you are at home. Even taking notes with the pencil is a terrible experience. I have the M2 and i cant justify the price At least the $3600 iPad has a better battery life than 2 hours and doesn&#39;t physically hurt to use after an hour.... The Best IPad case Is the Chesonia Case. It has a full HDMI port and 2 USB 2.0 ports and a head phone jack. It has a usb c port but that is only for charging.  It has full RGB black light keyboard and a supports Apple Pencil charging and a slot to put it when you close the screen. <br><br>I’ve gotten rid of my 2017 MacBook Pro and started using my 2021 iPad Pro and found an app equivalent on iPad for every desktop app i use. Including replacement for iTunes, video editing/conversion , application coding, etc. so for my use cases my iPad is a computer There is not a reasonable justification on why you would do such a thing. It&#39;s your money, you can do whatever you want, just wanted to let you know that you are part of the problem since you clearly support extreme overpricing, and the criminal business practices of Apple and other equivalent companies.  And I know you dont care...If only consumers had brain... iPadOS is still just too limiting for laptop duty imo. I tried writing with Google Docs and a browser in split screen, but when I wanted to juggle a third and fourth app, it just got far too clunky. I was missing my MacBook in minutes. Well, I would not pay $3600 USD (close to $5000 CAD) for a laptop, or a desktop, let alone a tablet.  It is insane. We need MacOS to merge with iPadOS. A MacPadOS. Adobe needs to allow all their desktop applications on iPad. Dude, don&#39;t talk so good about the new iPad. The only new thing is the front camera. It has the same software that can&#39;t do more than other tablets. I don&#39;t know why these YouTubers give so much relevance to small things that are the same as the last three years&#39; iPad Pro. At least give an honest review.  Sometimes I believe that Apple really pay them to talk, and I&#39;m not surprised that they do that. Prode to watch in ipad Day 3 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. Answer: &quot;Because you&#39;re rich (ish)&quot;. Let&#39;s face it... This video more than paid for it and if UK taxes work like US... It&#39;s a write-off. apple did the right thing by removing the ultrawide cam. it wasn&#39;t necessary or made any sense in the first place Intersting for an artist on the go I am 50 years old. I have my mbp and pen and paper... This guy is trying too hard to make me waste my money on something nobody needs. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=367\">6:07</a> barrel roll is for people like me (Graphic Designers)… trust me… I NEED this! Lol, your just talking about getting locked in, in the entire video. I&#39;ll stick with a real laptop with lots of ports and not glued or solders together. If iPads were to introduce cellular they’ll simply use iPhone’s cell plan right? The only problem is.... the calculator :)) I already tried with the ipad pro experience. Until it died and apple left me stranded. Lost all my data. Never again Who the heck stil buys a tablet in 2024 😮 Uh oh apple didn&#39;t mention battery life, using dual led display is bound to consume more power &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.&quot; because you can make the money back easily by publishing this video. because you&#39;re rich.. How about just spending $600 on an ipad air? Now everybody will literally Pre order it 😂 Just like me, justifying the purchase before buying tech that I might not use as much as I thought 😅 because you like to be locked under AppStore. Hear me out NO DEVICE should be that expensive now everybody will literally pre order it 😂 Man clearly never had to use Excel on iPad 🤦\\u200d♂️ the early part of this video made me nostalgic lol, i never even had a nexus 7 or nexus 10 but i wanted one because they looked so cool, and way more fun than a phone for some things. my sister had a galaxy tablet that i loved playing plague inc on. I’m agreeing with your points, but my bank account doesn’t, and as many people are, my bank account dictates my actions This terrible video is one of three things:<br>○ Paid by Apple to make a 16 minute ad and didn&#39;t disclose the sponsorship.<br>○ Made a 16 minute Apple ad for free.<br>○ Blatantly trying to write off an iPad purchase as a production/business expense. Because you have a good bank account? 😂 I would bet that if he actually dropped his Macbook for an iPad he would run into the software limitations of final cut and audio production really quick. They been doing this for ages cash grabbing using their &quot;powerful chip&quot; but not allowing users to use it&#39;s full potential. They even change the sizes just to force you to buy their new accessories. Think before you buy. &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.&quot; - Because you have over 18,5 millions subscribers many of whom are interested in mobile devices? Just a guess.... A lot of Call of duty:Mobile/Warzone mobile content creators are going to buy this to destroy smartphone players.😅 The only pros that are going to benefit from ipad pro are the graphic designers because of the new apple pencil. At the end of the day is a tablet. And 90% of things you do in tablets laptops or PCs can do it 100 times better. Trust me Lenovo tab p12 is the same but it&#39;s android and it&#39;s 300$ and not only this there are tons of nice big screen tablets on the market for affordable prices <br> so why waste money for a brand ? I almost replaced my laptop with a Galaxy Tab S7 FE. I even code on my tablet. it&#39;s crazy to know that apple are now paying youtubers to promote their products Not having the ability to install custom software (not coming from the app store) will always make me prefer MacOS over iPadOS. As a developer the iPad simply can&#39;t do what I need due to software limitations. &quot;The World&#39;s biggest Hypocrite&quot; sent me dead ☠💀 I really dont understand the need to buy an ipad for $3600, he could have bought 2 touchscreen oled laptops with crazy gpus, simply not worth it External display support still sucks. <br>Still iPadOS <br>Pretty package but still an iPad Now the question is, what do I do with my Macbook Air I just got for Christmas (Oh, My!) This is a 16 minute cope for the homie. It&#39;s ok though, do your thing He&#39;s F up!! Hes still in iPhone 6 era Storage isn&#39;t my issue, external is working for me, and there are various NAS options. But the inability to run Xcode on iPad is my limiting factor. <br><br>So Apple still is losing double on a power user like me. Instead of getting the latest or a second year newer replacement, I&#39;m keeping my MacBook Pro and iPads much longer. If I can&#39;t get what I want, then I&#39;ll just wait until the pain point is enough where I upgrade. It&#39;s 100% inexcusable that apple doesn&#39;t have Xcode on iPad, especially considering they sell a keyboard with a trackpad, and the iPad Air makes 100% no sense at all. not worth it I&#39;m really curious about the <b>actual</b> use case here - like, what do you actually do? I see ads of people holding it with one hand and editing photos with another - there are literally 0 actual photographers who has a workflow like that and not expect to starve to death. Can the iPad Pro connect to more than 1 screen? No matter what hardware is underneath it, iPadOS is still a limited, tablet OS. The thinness is cool and all, but who complained that the current iPads are too thick? For the amount of money for the iPad Pro, if you are actually needing to do a lot of work, might as well get a laptop with an OS that&#39;s not nearly as limiting as the one iPad has. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=432\">7:12</a> what is that game? the irony of this amazing, exciting review is that my main takeaway is how much I want one of those remarkable tablets Same here all the specs are useless as u can use the capabilities of the ipad to the fullest get an ipad with an M1 chip and u wont notice the diffrence \\u200b@@usamashehab8138 yep, this was my main takeaway, all of this has been possible from the moment iPads started using Mac chips, now it&#39;s just a tiny bit faster, and as long as iPad OS doesn&#39;t get better, like a normal pc, most of the speed improvement is pointless, unless you do a lot of hardware intensive work, just get an older M1 chip iPad I don&#39;t get where the &quot;irony&quot; is, is my brain not working properly or are people just saying &quot;irony&quot; with a new meaning now? @@da4127 I was definitely using the standard definition of &quot;irony&quot;! The irony being that this video is promoting a new tablet which is supposedly so amazing that it might replace Arun&#39;s MacBook AND his ReMarkable tablet, yet the result of the whole pitch was making me want to buy the ReMarkable tablet instead. We are now in the domain of luxury. Rich people buy cars that look nice and are fast, but are a pain when parking or shopping.<br><br>These iPads are the same, they offer some advantages you don&#39;t really need and come with so many disadvantages. <br><br>Just buy a normal car, a normal phone and a normal laptop and let the rich people play with their fancy toys. Before I watch the video.<br><br>You&#39;re a tech tuber, so of course you&#39;re gonna buy the top tier new iPad. IT I LOVE OT This is why i cannot buy apple products. Because they ezprxt me to pay $200 more go from 256gb to 512gb. And $600 to get 1tb and 1000 more for 2tb<br>That is insane. lol @ the guy at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=738\">12:18</a> apologising for getting in the way <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=23\">0:23</a> Was that-..

Unfortunately I am not weathy enougth. Love the video. Just fyi I’ve now had to subscribe to your channel( which I’ve followed for over 3 years) for the 3rd time.  Something keeps unsubscribing me. Bad YouTube 😂 I have a Samsung tablet and I gotta say, that thing gets so much use.  I used to not really care about tablets in more recent years, but I can call, text, watch media and use it for laptop stuff.  I do think tablets can be very useful. but should they cost so much? Would you pay $3000 for one? I have a gazillion laptops and tablets. I initially got tablets because I thought it was ridiculous that I should be &quot;forced&quot; by companies and governments to do important stuff on the phone&#39;s 6 inches (and forced we are, as phones are deemed safer than laptops from viruses etc by many higher powers). There&#39;s so little you can comfortably do on the tablet versus a laptop, and, for sanity&#39;s sake, if we limit the discussion to Apple devices, there&#39;s so little that can detract from the nice package that the M1 Air was, or the 15 inch M3 Air. Got to be said, if you can afford one you can probably afford the other, so over the long run you&#39;ll either end up with a wardrobe full of shoes like many females, or boxes full of semi-expired electronics :) @@DavidFrankland No, that&#39;s why he has a Samsung, which already comes with the pen included Ridiculous price for a tablet. My 12&quot; S7+tablet has more features, and it&#39;s been around for years. it&#39;s funny how many more slow people are in the comments on Apple products vs anything else What game was that shown in the vid? I own an ipad pro. I love it. But i use it less than I thought. It is just an overpriced tablet. I wish I could do more.. That sweater is gawjus I’ve recently changed my laptop for a tablet. I’m a teacher and the touchscreen makes my work much faster to be done, along with the fact that it’s more portable when I’m walking around the classroom talking to the kids. That been said, all my external keyboards, when connected to iPadOS, don’t work with Google’s services on the Web, and the app for the iPad is more limited than the online version, so now I can’t work with it. Luckily the school uses an Android tablet, and the keyboard works just fine. Looking forward to selling my iPad and getting a Samsung tablet instead. Title should have been &quot;Sponsored by Apple though this piece is actually shit&quot; Us though Apple fully speced is $3,077 just to let y’all know it’s not that bad lol This iPad is screaming from Apple..buy it as we can&#39;t figure out what else can be done on this tablet..... Simple because you have the money. Easy. 😊 Because you&#39;re a tech YouTuber making videos about new tech duh i like how we watched the day go by 🤣 unless they revamp ipadOS, the best it can be is for artist to draw on it Probably right up there with Apple Vision in the worst purchase ever category.... It&#39;s a waste of money. If you have money to waste, then buy it, else give it a big dose of swerve. My money is on the new Snapdragon chips + Windows Tablets. In practical use even a Surface tablet with M2 performance/Battery Life would still grossly outweigh the new Ipad M4 running IpadOS. Excellent video‼Just some friendly advice : Please try to make a video every 4 days instead of 2 quick videos in 2 days... then we don&#39;t have to wait a week or 2 for the next video.😉🌠 Oh yeah...by the way $3600 for a iPad is ridiculous! I would rather want a cheaper laptop. Imagine spending money on Apple. I still prefer desktop OS in tablet form. sorry but its a rich person talking rich problems with rich solutions, 0 real world aplication Instead of paying for TB of storage to get the nano screen option, just buy the paper-like screen protector and save yourself a boatload of money. That tablet is more expensive than my rtx 3080 and i9 laptop It&#39;s a bit sad to see @Mrwhosetheboss slowly becoming an apple fanboy. It&#39;s no way you can justify spending this much money on a tab which can barely do things a pc do (unless you are the 0.1% of the people who do very specific stuffs). So unless Apple gives the iPad Pros the capability of a MacOs, this doesn&#39;t make any sense. I own an iPad pro 11 inch and I regret buying it. It&#39;s a great powerhouse but it&#39;s sad to see that you can do so less stuffs with it. Because Apple pays you mate ... I need to be a YouTuber content creator lol then do a speed test ipad pro m4 versus the same price on PC $3,600 This is the best argument I&#39;ve seen yet to justify the crazy cost of these things, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m convinced.<br><br>I have been saying for 6 months &quot;when the new OLED iPads come out I&#39;m going to buy one&quot;.

God damn. My whole Gaming PC was only CAD $2308.73. I might get the new iPad Air 2024 though Hey can you buy the pixel 8a the new phone made by Google pls Because you want views The issue with tablets is they only run iOS. Sometimes, for a lot of programs and functionality, you need the full blown OS. Not a mobile OS. As such, I find it impossible to justify personally spending that kind of money on a tablet device, regardless of use case. It just lacks the fundamentals. I&#39;m surprised this video is being made in 2024. 2019-2020 was the period where iPad Pros really took off on the performance and portability side. I bought one - the OS and consistent limitations of apps is the system&#39;s fatal flaw. It shouldn&#39;t be MacOS, but its functionality has to be much closer to it to make the added cost worth it. I still think this is primarily a creative&#39;s tool which can occasionally - but maddeningly inconsistently -  replace a laptop&#39;s productivity functions. dude u can’t justify that price tag, as much as like apple products Bro wanted to justify buying an ipad (i have m1 ipad and i love it) His life is so posh he actually convinced himself he needs it for a very specific situation lol Btw - Nano Coating you WILL regret! Mark my words! What about you are going to make I phone I&#39;m shocked that this channel has as many subs as Good Mythical Morning...

Thank you so much for spending $3600 of your hard earned money so we can see just what the top end ipad can do. That&#39;s quite a sacrifice. Bruh, the title shocked me so much that I had to comment… I did not know this new iPad costed THIS much ☠️☠️☠️ this costs more than what I paid for my M1 Max 14” Listening to you talk is so exhausting...LoL sorry Another boring Apple product! I just wish I could have mac OS on the ipad. Unthinkable this can go up to 3600 lmaoo wtf 😂 bought the base pro myself though, excited for it.

Those you browse the web, email, etc. it’s a better solution aside from the clunky file management system.<br><br>But working on the web in digital marketing and development it’s still not there. Mazel tov on the wedding. Imagine spending a pc worth of money on a tablet just to find a kid watching yt kids on it Most powerful Youtube and Netflix machine.

It will be a big help. I don&#39;t have a phone to do my work in university. Please buy a big help.😢😢 Shill ... for apple. put a keyboard on it ... and call it a computer Key deal breaker for me is definitely operating system. Can&#39;t run x86 desktop applications? It&#39;s out then. Versatility on the iPad has always been gimmicks to me, it may feel good but I really can&#39;t see how it&#39;s better than using a proper laptop. Few more reasons for apple to be unreasonably expensive 😂😂😂 He spent that money because he’s rich beyond belief I just use my Ipad for watching YouTube videos and checking my email. It doesn’t matter how good it is when it is limited by iPadOS. Qual o jogo q ele está jogando aos <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=777\">12:57</a> ? Problem is ipad os not ipad - ipad os vs mac is shit… Last two months, since the Sonoma update, i no longer able to use my ipad pro as a drawing tablet. I&#39;d complain it to the Apple store, and their sales just told me to buy a new one. 🙄 I feel like fallen into their planned obsolescene agenda! I&#39;ll not buy into it, my China-made xp-pen last longer than my ipad pro. 😡 (xp-pen  died after 9 years due to wear and physical drop, ipad pro not working due to fking OS update 2 months b4 new device launch! 🙃) People who get these things must be super rich, like dude I&#39;ll just build a really powerful pc for that price, you can watch netflix, play AAA games, use it for work, run powerful softwares, etc<br>All in one<br>I mean yeah it can do it too but on a much smaller screen<br>dosent this just target some super niche audience ? <br>how do they manage to stay profitable on this device ? Im guessing that Apple will move iPadOS closer to MacOS this summer with enough puffer to not replace the MacBook Air’s. Especially this new generation of iPad‘s but even the last two are so ridiculously overpowered, it just doesn’t make any sense to run them on the same system as the baseline iPad. So... Can we talk about how Microsoft Surface was essentially doing what Apple is trying to do with an iPad right now. The only key difference is that Apple is trying to make a mobile OS work as a Desktop one, while the Surface always were using a full Windows OS. It maxes out at £2599. Totally nailed it for me. Exactly all the points I was thinking about spoken out loud. Another point worth mentioning: For folks who&#39;s workplace has moved onto virtual desktop (i.e. Citrix), the Citrix iPad app pretty much allows you to have a Windows PC on your iPad - how sick is that! Of course you&#39;d spend so much on the iPad. If not you then who? It&#39;s only designed for people like you and people who want to flex. Not for your audience. what the sketchbook name? Bro is mrbeast buying everything you talk too much bro, I lost patience 🤣 Yeah thats cool but where&#39;s the calculator 😅 totally useless video. You complicating simpler stuff. A comparison is simpler, but your divig into &quot;your&quot; problems for the comparison and review. I would like to ask you why you&#39;re reviewing only the apple environment products. It seems clear to me you&#39;ve made up your mind already for iPad and just clearly compromising most stuff for &quot;your&quot; iPad. Neither the video review, comparison is absolutely biased. Anyone else watching this because they decided they don&#39;t need the new iPad but want to convince themselves otherwise?

Still stupid to make them that thin when the cameras are double the thickness. That&#39;s pure stupid.

Just curious Short Answer: Because you can afford it. <br><br>I’m sure the new iPads are great and all but they’re still iPads at the end of the day. I don’t think Apple would allow iPads to use powerful software even though the tablet is capable of running them. I wished it had a MagSafe connection like the iPhones, it is super useful and convenient. Not sure how they could efficiently do it on a such big device, but I really hope we see more wireless charging going forward Because you&#39;re wealthy? :-&lt; iPads Pro? MacBooks Air? Remember when iPad  was less than $500 AUD. Im a 8 inch tablet guy for daily use even to make phonecall.. my wife call it the face fone...coz it cover my face when im on a call that&#39;s like the... opposite of the wisest decision of your life Just marketing and brand just making money, i bought M2 macbook pro 13months back and now display is getting black screen to replace display they charging 860sgd worst investment ever just buy less expensive windows laptop i thought you are dead 8tb 🌝 MrWhosetheAppleFanboi Chicken nugget Well done! Since the iPad Pro was introduced, this is the BEST review about that product! Everyone else enthusiastically repeats the advantages of the hardware &quot;a modular MacBook Air with a stylus and touchscreen and the latest M chip for laptops&quot; (incorrectly called &quot;iPad Pro&quot;, and wrongly equipped with iPhone software!), but no one mentions the biggest problem: THERE IS NO SOFTWARE FOR THE IPAD PRO!!! But there is a price for a laptop! The iPad Pro product is not an attempt by Apple to offer consumers a top-notch product and experience during use, but rather to test their unintelligence! Any user who has logged in with an iPad Pro and has not logged out after 4 weeks of use is probably recorded by Tim Cook as an irreparable zombie who cannot be helped and is not worth Apple&#39;s effort to save and take with them when the asteroid that will destroy the planet comes! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=524\">8:44</a> I think the screen is not fingerprint resistant You only buy an ipad for that money simply because you have that money and you can. Its a tablet. Its not worth 3000+ Idk what he’s yapping about iPads aren’t replacing pcs both have different features and needs. If you put touch on the MacBooks and make them 180 degree foldable they gonna replace iPads in an instant. There is no need for an iPad other than its touchscreen that is why Apple didn’t made touch laptop to this day. this is exactly how I convince myself when I am going to buy something expensive... &quot;use their app than direct me to their website&quot;<br><br>That depends, eh? Some services are exclusively app based for no good reason even though their frontend is web based. A few apps? Fine. 10? 20? How many dedicated apps do you want on your phone?<br><br>As for the iPad, sure it&#39;s shiny and pretty and stupidly fast... but so have they all since the M1. The problem is that very very few apps take advantage of that and the operating system actively prevents a lot of possibilities.

Im just 3600$ short rn The video would make sense if it cost $500. @@ronald3836 You CAN buy an iPad for $500 or even less. Lowkey Bro you gotta change your microphone Answering your questions: because you&#39;re a content creator and you need content that could be interesting for as much people as possible. End of history Thin and speed on a useless OS. Nice review.<br>But i ain&#39;t spending 3 grand on a tablet. Nope! Literally buying for the bright screen. In a sunny climate and 1000 nits using outside, practical - rest of the power,  likely wont get used much. Central front camera a must too. Except that the current iPad Pro has the exact same level of brightness. @@mikemccormick6128 but I have the 2018 11 inch pro, so an improvement over that. iPads are good for gaming and drawing. The main reason most people buying them is for drawing. And the people who just want to watch YouTube and Netflix they can buy cheaper models. Pre-ordered the 11inch. Can’t wait my man bought the tablet before I could even know that this YouTube Kids machine even appeared I&#39;m in love with bros writing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=130\">2:10</a> Best tech stack is to buy a cheap phone, get an iPad skip laptop and get an average desktop + good GPU setup. <br><br>Total cost -<br><br>$500 for -Pixel 8a<br>$1000 for iPad <br>$4000 PC + GPU setup. Best performing tech setup with a reasonable price for ehat you&#39;re getting. Because you are a tech reviewer? I just got the latest ipad but now this??!!!!! Let me guess… The revenue from this video will cover the cost of the purchase? $3600 ? holy shit. that&#39;s wayyy too much If iPad would have VSCode, I would move on using ipad instead of laptop/pc Ipad needs Mac OS. sure i will try to make you I Glad 😂😂 Honestly the only reason to get an iPad Pro is for the Apple Pencil but there’s no reason to get the m4 iPad Pro, it’s just to much performance, I understand there’s apps like zbrush but why not get a MacBook for that? Stage Manager still seems an idea that&#39;ll lower your productivity Apple have the opportunity at this WWDC to bring macOS to iPad Pro M4 and make this device skyrocket in sales and have an actual meaningful use.<br>Make it something like DeX by Samsung but the Apple way. Have an icon that you can switch simultaneasly between iPadOS and macOS because the hardware is there, the only real work they have to do is to make macOS touchscreen friendly. We all know they have enough resources to do that, so if they don&#39;t, they are doing it on purpose! So two things I feel like weren&#39;t conveyed properly. First, iPad OS <b>is not</b> MacOS. You literally <b>cannot</b> do many things on the iPad that you could do with a full operating system. If you&#39;re locked in the Apple ecosystem and only need to use the few apps Apple provides for the iPad, then sure, it could replace a MacBook in that narrow use case.<br><br>Second thing is app developers generally treat tablet like the unwanted stepchild. The <b>worst</b> version of most apps shared between phone, tablet, or desktop will be the tablet version (assuming a tablet version even exists, often it will just be a badly stretched phone version). It&#39;s the smallest marketshare so the lowest priority to get right. at least u get 40  bucks off if u trade in ur m2 ipad LOOOOL 3600USD? Unreal insanity! Apple know how to rip you off<br>The title suggests you have to spend 3600USD on this tablet to get all the functions you&#39;re talking about<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=260\">4:20</a> Wow the dude discovered how function and quick keys works..... But you did not buy it, did you? TLDR: For clicks. Bold of you to think Apple will let you replace the macbook with a tablet. Goodluck with that. maybe by year 2060 The ipad power is overwhelming, the ipad system and apps are underwhelming. Ipads are good to consume videos, music, storing sheet music and take notes. My 2014 macbook pro from 2014 still beats any ipad for making music for me due to lack of support for vsts and AU like NI kontakt,EZ drummer and the pletora of effect plugs I have. For writing scientific papers an ipad is hopeless due to similar lack of apps supporting my field. This area is off course also dominated by microsoft programs and templates designed for those. I can still write those papers on a macbook pro from 2014 using the same software as efficent…… Damn only cost me 2500 usd in the USA for the 2 tb model Because you are a aron What was that 3D design software they were using? what is the game at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=435\">7:15</a> ? This review is quite different from MKBHD’s review, or rather view on iPads/tablets in general. 😮<br><br>I suspect Apple will merge the two systems together and have a macOS experience for work with mouse and trackpad connected and a tablet mode for entertainment/relax time. The cringe of super rich youtubers pretending to complain about price. &quot;We have an app for that&quot;. Sure and if it works on my old mobile phone it gets updated and will not. We run Windows 0S for around 10 years and programmes are likely to run on previous versions of Windows and the next version. Android and iOS apps get fixed to shorter update runs of Android. A device gets only one update, more on iPhones and then it is fixed. So having an app comes with &quot;how long will it be before I need to upgrade my phone?&quot; But that is not the only issue. The latest operating system might not allow an older app to run.  You app enabled device then needs an old phone to still use it. As much as it works for you which is great personally I am with MKBH more power, thinner, still not a labtop releasement yet.  Wishing you beautiful wedding. Why you spent that much? Ofcourse, for clout. I like that the thing is so expensive that the guy had to make a video talking about buying it before even receiving the actual thing, haha. Because you love being ripped off Did he really tried to convince himself to buy a 3600$ ipad instead of a 2000$ macbook, to get better designed mobile games ? باختصار الشركة دفعت لك كي تعلن لها. How much money do you get for this commercial? This is probably stupid but what if to make it so you still will buy a Mac, ok hear me out… a inbuilt ai into the next Mac, but the ai would have to have something special to it to entice people like crazy good auto correct or something Keyboard without Backlight casual Apple things <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=741\">12:21</a> hakki Mrwhosetheshill what brand of sweater is he wearing in this video? looks comfy Ultimate psychology His buddy should prank him by bending it 😂 All that is missing, since the switch to &quot;M&quot; chip iPads is the option to Dual Boot between iPadOS and MacOS. There is no technical reason why this can&#39;t be done, it is simply a decision Apple has made. If I had the option to run MacOS on an iPad for some specific use cases and otherwise iPadOS for everything else I would, like you, get rid of my MBP. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=225\">3:45</a> is that a hint that the wedding is coming?

But, like all things Apple, imitate not innovate. average apple fanboy I&#39;m still wondering if its worth it 🤔 Can you make a video about what that iPad can do that an air for about $800 or cheaper cannot do?<br>What do you get for that extra money?<br>I guess a much cheaper iPad can do all the work that the expensive can do I love the idea of this thing.. I wish I had a use for it.  --The author&#39;s 4090 I agree. Ipad apps are easier to use than their pc counterparts, but sometimes lack basic features. gargantuan waste of money Because if you don&#39;t buy it you can&#39;t milk it for content in the next 1 year waste of money, any person with common sense would buy or build a PC for the same price 2 million views..........I think he can buy a few full specs iPad Pro 13inch. 🤣🤣🤣<br><br>Trust me, you don&#39;t need iPad. For $3,600 - Macbook Air 15 inch full specs and still have some spare change left. Plus, Macbook Air battery still last much much longer than iPad. <br><br>I have iPhone 15 Pro Max, Macbook Air 15 full specs and Apple Watch Ultra 2..........why do you really need iPad? I&#39;ve never even owned an apple product and I find this interesting 😂 Samsung &gt; Apple The price is ludicrous. It&#39;s amazing how much you can con people just by good marketing. Of course Apple friendly YouTubers help Dear Apple, to answer the Question; What is a Computer? , Answer: It is an IPad which has Apples version of Samsung DEX featured in the OS😅. This is the answer I think you are still looking for, and I think will satisfy all iPad users.  I mean Samsung has it and the Microsoft surface has this same feature now. So what are you waiting for….?. Ow and if apple is able to pull this off, I think a lot of buyers will choose the iPad over the MacBook Air as their first device in the Ecosystem. Ow pricing….😅😅😅😅😅 what about m3 ? did it jumep over m3 or what? I HATE when a product tells me to use their app. Not everything needs an app. Most are completely unnecessary. &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4&quot;... &quot;because I&#39;m no smart guy&quot; While every other YouTuber is calling the new iPad for what it is - a joke - Arun here, an Apple fanboy, is coming in to rescue this obsolete brand from losing more sales than they already have. Objectively speaking Samsung tablets are way more useful and don&#39;t cost an arm and a leg. Aaron singlehandley funding the economy Are apples prices justified in the year 2024? Because of the hype, I did buy ipad pro 11 1st gen back in 2019, only to be used as a streaming device on my dining table when the family eats. 😂 I Wish That This new ipad pro Had Dynamic Island And it might be worth it Ithink the best thing to buy is the 999 11 inch one cuz if ur not a youtuber why do u need it☠️☠️ Boycott ipad M4😊👍 No matter how overpowered iPad is it is still limited by iPad OS. Until Apple brings in MacOS in it&#39;s iPad, I will stick with my 360 degrees revolving touchscreen laptop. There&#39;s no way I&#39;m gonna pay monthly subscriptions for APPS such as FCP, come on!

Why I spent 3400$ on new iPad Pro M4?<br><br>A: Cause you’re an Apple fanboy and you’ve way too much idle money on your hands!! You should not think Apple uses currency exchange rate. 2800 pounds will be just 2800 euros in Europe and 2800 dollars in US. Fair? No. But that’s what it is. i&#39;m just waiting for jerry rig everything&#39;s video 💀🙏 I think is not worth the price of 2 MacBook Pro I don’t recommend you to buy MacBook and iPad you waste your money the reviews are fake laptop for use  is only windows   Much better in reality Macs are a pc replacement to use pc apps on the go. Ipad is just a bigger phone unless ipad runs macos This is why you don&#39;t have to take the opinion of apple fan boys seriously If any of you have noticed the background during the start to the end it changed from morning to night <br>What a long video!<br>Looks like Arun has spent the entire day just sitting in one position and explaining why is buying the iPad pro M4. Selling &quot;iPad like MacBook&quot; and &quot;Pen&quot; and &quot;smart keyboard&quot;, now why wouldn&#39;t you get this over MacBook.😂 Honestly, if it&#39;s most likely going to be use on a table anyway, why would the weight matter? Slimmer often means easier to break as well. Using an iPad Pro m1 as my secondary device for quite a few years, here what I miss from my Mac :<br>- using the full desktop Notion app (so I could open pages in side peek)<br>- using a full desktop web browser (Arc would be marvellous) =&gt; this would also solve my first issue<br>- using the full desktop Adobe suite.<br><br>For everything else, this m1 iPad is already very capable. Video editing is still better on the Mac obviously, and I would miss my AI auto cut plugins on Final Cut, but with a few software tweaks on iPadOS would help me be totally different in my usages.<br><br>I would trade my MacBook Pro for a Mac Studio, and use macOS only on my sitting main device.<br>My iPad would finally be the perfect secondary device, the one sufficient to do ALL the things I need to do on the go. No need for a MacBook anymore.<br><br>So it’s <b>that</b> close to be perfect but the software is not perfect. I hope to see the light during the WWDC It does not cost $3600 lol <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Rest in peace, Ipad now the tablet is officially dead. Isn&#39;t it just guitarists and kids who play with Ipads. Overall, I think the whole touchscreen hype is cooling off. When even the automakers start bringing back physical buttons, we know that the touch hysteria sings the final verse. Metal and glass slab to be held in one&#39;s hand ... I&#39;m also planning a video on this Apple knows that if they put any price tag, people will still buy it. Even if the product is actually worth 1/4th of its value. Biggest issue is it is still just IPad OS, not full IOS operating system...heavily restricted in any type of advanced functioning. I cannot use a PC where I am unable to do anything advanced that would be a piece of cake on Windows or Linux or IOS. Nope just let ppl install IOS on it (it has the power) and then it would be a game changer. At present its just a faster IPad, def not a game changer. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> yooooooooooooooooooooo You know what I like most about this video. <br><br>There was a visual passage of time.<br><br><br>That was cool. I have a iPad Pro (M1), and a iPad Mini, both have cellular, and I couldn&#39;t dream of having a tablet without it in the future. I am currently waiting for the next mini to be released, as I find I use my mini far more than the pro. Apple is actually trying to kill minis. Haven&#39;t you seen how they &quot;silently&quot; removed the ipod nanos and the iphone minis?<br><br>Yeah definetely they just dumped the mini versions of the ipads too<br><br>next thing you know they&#39;ll drop a backpack to keep all of that stuff that&#39;ll be like $1000 and wont even fit them if you wont buy a bigger $2000 version. <br><br>I just realised the monopoly that apple is.<br><br>Also probably, apple is just ditching EVERY device they can until they have an ultimate device that&#39;s just gonna be the single one. This feels like a social experiment more that a company being greedy.<br><br>Sorry for putting like every shower thought i had from this video. @@AlexMatracaru Sounds like you don&#39;t even know what a monopoly is. No one is forcing anyone to buy an apple product. No one is stopping you from buying a Samsung. A monopoly would be like where I live, my cable company is Spectrum. I am not allowed to get cable service from any other cable company. I either get Spectrum, or I don&#39;t get cable. Period. That&#39;s a monopoly. @@mikemccormick6128 so apparently you didn&#39;t read the whole thing and dont know that was just a random thought i didn&#39;t think of twice before posting @@mikemccormick6128 also you&#39;re a nerd I see that tablets not that important At this point apple should give the I pad macos Considering trading in my current ipad for this, really like the OLED screen as someone who uses the ipad for art Even if I would buy this iPad I don’t think it would replace my reMarkable. No tablet has the “paper feel” it has. Plus, it only does one thing really well, instead of a bunch of things that distract me from note taking. trying to justify $3600 for a pile of metal is crazy ❤ if i would have had that much money i would buy every apple product and try it out myself and not watch this video<br>but since i am broke i am quitting youtube to earn a better living and am not going to watch this video All ipads eventually become a Youtube and Netflix machine if you want to work on something go for a laptop What do you mean by car&#39;s worth of money?? what&#39;s the jumper he&#39;s wearing?

Anyone? People even promoting these heavily nerfed MacBooks need an unsubscribe. Amazing video, as always! not sure how anyone can take this guy serious with videos like this. honestly i think its TOO thin. I would rather it be a bit thicker. Who would of thought that an iPad costs more than the Vision Pro „Full on computer“ but doesn’t have pro apps 🤡 I own a Macbook Pro M1 Pro but the price of this new tablet is just obscene. just adding to your click through rate to laugh at every buyer in the comments Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4 = answer cuz you are paid youtuber The only way I found that I can use an iPad successfully to replace my laptop is to stick to using Safari browser, Google apps do not work as well as their browser versions. For instance, this browser version of Safari allows me to export a single page from a spreadsheet as a PDF. This is not possible in the apps, also, if you are using a keyboard the shortcuts between cells do not work in the app but they do within the browser. <br><br>(I’ve uninstalled all of the apps except for Spotify. Running a iPad Pro with Logitech folio keyboard and trackpad) If anyone has ideas on an alternative method to keeping track of files instead of the default finder let me know. About the pen function , I think Samsung did few year before… If you can run it on MacOS- maybe.  On iPadOS no way.  It&#39;s a big phone unless it&#39;s on MacOS.

The software is way behind.  Put a decent OS on the damn things already.  This would make a great portable dev machine. funfact i am watching your video on ipad pro Yep but like you said it doesn’t have file manager and you cannot install any computer app you may need for school/university file manager is a thing for years now on ipad Please do a giveaway 😅 I can’t buy one. I think people are forgeting that the new generation kids are using tablets more then anything else. These products are hitting their consumers, only that&#39;s not us. You are losing touch dude. The price is ridiculous and you are defending not just an awful company, but justifying consumerism and garbage products. He biggest concern about iPad or IpadOS is: Often using a single performance core only, maybe max. two of them! Hope, this will gone change. Also background activity with attached power supply should be offered. I never ever had any usecase for a Laptop!😅 Using passive cooled PC or iPad pro. We will be surprised about Snapdragon X Elite SoC Performance in a few months! At that price It should be able to run MacOS so that I can do programming with it. And it can run MacOS easily Apple just don&#39;t want to enable it.

Cause you know I&#39;m a tablet guy, I&#39;m a smart watch guy but never been a phone guy :-| Ipad = tech decoration i dont understand the proper use .. like neither i can make serious zoom calls (as i may need to share some urgent files), neither i can play fortnite, neother i can edit videos properly (for professional  use) , downloading asset, putting in files/ videos is too much time consuming... <br><br>like this has nothing to do with processor speed... this is downside of tabs as a whole. i own ipad and android tab both.. like .. mostly for casual task... its not usefull for professional use at all. sorry, but nobody cares about the thinness of a ipad, when they get a battery performence in the other case. Why is this guy speaking like Surface Pro never existed?! Because you are now a fanboy. ❤ Its nice if you are rich you can spend in useless things! None of what you are talking about is new to the latest iPad Pro - at least to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=569\">9:29</a>. Prepare to be disappointed - using an iPad with the Magic Keyboard is nothing at all like using a Mac, and very little of the difference is for the better. I went from an M1 12.9&quot; iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard to an M2 MacBook Air and it is way better. That was while I had (and still have) a 16&quot; M1 Max MacBook Pro. I have had an iPad mini 6 since it launched and I didn&#39;t miss the 12.9&quot; at all when I sold it. I am just about to buy an 11&quot; Pro to replace the mini 6 (for the tandem OLED display), but I won&#39;t be wasting money on a keyboard for it and I will be keeping my M2 Air and my M1 Max 16&quot; When you rich &amp; 18.5 Million subs, you can afford a 4K IPad. 😅 You are going to be massively disappointed if you are for real. I guess everyone&#39;s just gonna allow brushing your teeth like that to slide. when an ipad costs more than the vision pro Click bait, does not actually have it First world problems at its finest. ......coz you gonna make more money making the video with it. can anyone help me with the grey blouse/shirt he&#39;s wearing here? the company/type please? Are we all getting sent an invitation to the wedding?? Not worth the money IME. Macbook can do more and is better. Just 400k away from apple A super thin tablet device sounds so bad when you have someone like me with massive hands I still think that an iPad is absolutely not capable enough to be as good as a real MacBook, just going on safari, open multiple tab .. like open a YouTube video on safari while opening an other … you can’t, you can’t run 2 videos on safari at all, it paused it …. <br><br>App on iPad are good but very locked on what you have to do and you cannot move the needle from “it suppose to do that” to “let do more” like Final Cut .. it’s good but it’s stuck to what it supposed to do .. <br><br>I mean that they’re still things stuck on the fact that it’s still iPadOS … Adobe photoshop<br>Unity<br><br>These two apps can&#39;t find it on IPAD My ipad has completely replaces my tv. I can’t imagine not having a tablet. Man i really wanna order one of these lol just debating if the 1tb is worth it for the additional core Perfect for (rich) ipad kids With the current iPadOS there is nothing exciting about these iPads and they will still be terrible laptops replacements for most people. I&#39;ve tried many times to go iPad only, so I&#39;m completely on board with the idea, but in real life it&#39;s frustrating as hell. Mobile apps are much worse than desktop apps , take basic stuff like Google Docs or MS Office or Lightroom, it&#39;s just worse to use. Yes, editing photos on an iPad is nice and intuitive sometimes, but anyhting with file managment etc is a nightmare. No matter how much Apple spends in advertising through YouTubers to make the iPad feel like Macbook without making any core changing the outcome will be the same. iPad sucks. Apple to you want an advice free of charge? iPad and Macbook nowadays have the same chip so there is no point of making two products with the &quot;same&quot; specs but with different OSs.. and trying to make an iPad to feel like a laptop... Just create a MacBook with these beautiful chip you&#39;ve made, with a detachable keyboard and Mac OS installed and voilà. You have the perfect Laptop iPad and you stop putting so much effort on a laptop like iPad. how much did this guy get paid by apple? ….and why you shouldn’t. That should be the title The &quot;I can neither confirm nor deny...&quot; had me pause😂 Review ❌️ Ad ✅️.   Apple can consider fewer events now. For the storage question: you can have an external m.2 ssd bay, where you put any SSD you want in it. I have a 1TB drive with me like this, so you can easily have a 4TB with you at all times. And because its external, you can connect it with USBC cable to a phone as well I have the 12.9 m1… it really is just a big iPhone… lol I like apple products, but remember apple will do anything to grab you as app store user. They are deliberately slowing new website features and trying you to sell apple device because then they take 30% cut of everything Of course you did. டேப்லட்டே இல்லமாயே டேப்லட் பற்றிய காணொளியா இந்த குரளி வித்தைய நீயும்டா பண்ண ஆரம்பிச்சிடயா? you know what would be perfect? Ipad pro hardware, with the latest android software. The Pro can be great for Graphic Designers, Photo Editors, and Artists. But I do not see someone picking this one up instead of Air easily. It is much more expensive compared to an Air. The screen on the iPad Air is quite good actually. I think a Mac is better for gaming though. I never had problems with indie games. AAA games are extremely boring. The only good thing they have going on is graphics. Imagine spending $3600 on a tablet, only for drawing🥴 another YT video with fake screen image of a PS-ed ipa in handd.. lame Do not get the nano coating.. You will regret it... Cleaning it would be a pain and you&#39;re at risk of it getting scratched easily. Especially since it is a touch screen device. Tosser... thin → fine; fast, powerful → swift; big → great; normal → usual, plain; little bit: pick one; thick → coarse; performance → speed; computer → desktop; PC → Wintel, DT; doesn’t !→ they: 1 != 2 Honestly, imagine what that $3600 tablet <b>really</b> costs Apple for the parts &amp; labour. People aren&#39;t trying to kill themselves at Foxconn cos they&#39;re worried about making too much money, and the difficulty of choosing the best investment options! To make a video and get more revenue <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=520\">8:40</a> game name? Can&#39;t wait to see you edit your videos on the iPad So its not a Laptop? If the ipad is really worth it for your own work then its a win but dont buy tech that isnt useful. I bought ipad for a reason, i use procreate for art, note taking, good performance, 120Hz rate, music making/garageband. Thats why i have ipad, some buy samsung tablet cuz they have their own personal preference. Dont buy something to show off, thats literally a waste of money, buy if you think it will support u for future. “Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.” Cuz I’m rich and money ain’t sh*t and I’ll make 1000x the money back from this video 100 % TRUTH 1. Apple is such a money whore<br>2. Those huge bezels on an iPad Pro should be illegal<br>3. Apple ain’t ever been the same since Steve Jobs died, we need REAL innovation back which tablet has a smaller bezel and how is that more practical? Does that thing has fortnite ?🧐😢 To earn 36000 from the review video? It&#39;s so SAD to see the downfall of your videos.<br>Unpourposfull videos which are only made to cover some costs!

Too bad their internals are slowly dying away. Apple has yet to surpass their iPad Air 2 from 2014, form-factor-wise.<br>It&#39;s like these companies have been trying hard to put insanely powerful chips in more and more uncomfortable to hold (yet extremely instagramable) bodies. Are they making devices for social media instead of humans? Go to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=476\">7:56</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=479\">7:59</a> and look at the cameras. I think there is some photoshopping with the depth sensor. 😏😂 CAUGHT U ARUN. Watching this youtube video with a samsung tablet (galaxy tab S7) 🤓 iPads are undoubtedly very very capable devices and rather impressive pieces of tech BUT, your workflow in iPad OS is where things will be frustrating. <br>I&#39;m on the M1 iPad Pro and there is nothing I throw at it that it could not do well but I still finding myself wanting that efficiency of MacOS.<br><br>Hopefully that will drastically improve with iPadOS 18 later this year. It&#39;s nice , but I have zero interest in having a tablet in my life . Plus apple is a greedy company. I now can comfortably say that this time Apple has copied samsung.... It&#39;s more expensive than the 77in samsung s90c OLED TV What pullover are you wearing??? &lt;3 I still have the ipad 11 inch m1 chip and will never upgrade!!!! maybe ill do that when m5 or m6 chips will introduce! im happy with my ipad, always like thee pencil for art!!! and very useful for editing..... Ooohhh, i know why you spent 3600 on the new iPad! Because for every video, you make at least $30,000 per million views? Yea, that&#39;s probably why. Since you haven’t used an iPad in a while, I’m going to burst your bubble….sorry but you will miss your MacBook. As soon as you try to do things MacOS specific, and there are many of them, you’ll be reaching for that MacBook. Trust me, I’ve tried the last few versions of iPadOS and it just isn’t there yet. I love my iPad Pro but it is definitely a complement to my MacBook, not a replacement, no matter how lite and screen type the iPad is. I do have an iPad but recently just switched to mac as the ipad wasn&#39;t able to run unity and program web site. So you dindt buy it? Haha so apple&#39;s ipad is finally as good as a standard Samsung tablet.<br>cool. welcome to 2020 apple fans.<br>oh, and Samsung tablets have a great file system sitting here on my 4080 g14 that can do literately anything that cost £2500 i dont feel ripped off.. Android phones have had deep black acreens forever 😂😂 What do you do when you crack the screen Ipad could replace Macbook?<br><br>Day by Day, Arun is losing his credibility by becoming a Pro-Apple Fanboy. This guy has a lot to learn from MKBHD!!!!!!!! What a waste. Buying a new iPad Pro is equivalent to buying a Yugo 45 with a turbocharged V8 engine. <br><br>It&#39;s still just a Yugo and drives like shit. Just like an iPad Pro Omega Supreme is still just an oversized iPhone, I mean iPad. <br><br>And the cash grab with increasing the size marginally, just to make old keyboards obsolete and not making the new pen backwards compatible, it&#39;s disgusting. <br><br>Good job Apple, as expected, don&#39;t ever change. 🤦\\u200d♂️ On the next episode of jerryrig everything….iPad breaks when it’s in your backpack and you drop it 20 inches off the ground 🤣🤣🤣 3600!? Man buy a MacBook you’re ridiculous paying that much for an iPad with a new Magic Keyboard…dude you’re crazy Why are apple products so expensive?!?!?!<br>🤦\\u200d♂️ 3600?? rofl How relatable I&#39;m worried. If ipad becomes the main device over laptop or phone, then apple is just having monopoly. no other brand is even close when it comes to tablet improvements. So it&#39;s soo great for Apple to push the &quot; tablets are the best device&quot; narrative Pixel 8a review, please because you can, there is no why. The device is great for creative professionals like architects and VFX artists. It&#39;s also great for note-taking. All that power is essentially for rendering and multi-track playback. Beyond that, it&#39;s still a giant phone for Netflix and YouTube. For software engineers that <b>aren&#39;t</b> WebDevs, iPadOS still isn&#39;t adequate.<br><br>It&#39;s a great non-general-purpose computer for non-techie people. Whenever iPadOS allows access to system files (and not just a siloed-off section of memory that is the equivalent of an empty flash drive), allows for app downloads from third-party websites, allows for compiling of code LOCALLY and natively, along with allowing floating windowed apps vs. only allowing for tiling two to three apps at a time... Only then will it be worth a look for technical folks.<br><br>For the rest of us, we&#39;ll stick with MacBooks! 😄 i saw somewhere that ipads are nerfed macs. even with all that power, it&#39;s still just an ipad. you can&#39;t maximize the hardware because of the limitations of iPadOS. I think tablets are mostly bought by med students. We have apps that can only run in android or ios, so we can&#39;t really buy a pc or mac. But i gotta admit consuming content in a tablet is a whole different feel. But if you have an option, always go for PC. ARUN, WHERE DID YOU BUY THAT GREY SHIRT FROM PLEASE? Can any of you just be frank with me? Is Apple allowing the iPad mini to go extinct or what? So I have the Ipad 9 for Uni and never have I ever thoguht &quot;wow this needs more power than my pc&quot; Time to play PUBG on the M4 pro hahahaha. Terror in the lobby Great review BOSS Here at 1,901,200 views. The amount of cope here... I bet pencil 2 won’t work <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Wild I am a youtuber❤ congrats on your wedding bro 🤟🏼😂🤙🏼 Because you can plain and simple 😂😂 Literally all im seeing is stuff on the Samsung tablet, especially the pen, but the s pen pro even works on the phones as well <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=623\">10:23</a> you can also see your documents offline in google chrome As much as I hate Apple this stuff is pretty darn cool. Can you do a video about the motarola razr 40 ultra Displays are actually Samsung&#39;s and LG&#39;s, so... I&#39;m still waiting born of a real tech blogger, not an Apple fan. The info should be told in the video. It&#39;s not an Apple ad, it&#39;s a kind of review and first look. But is it worth the price? Like Apple prices are just absurd I wonder if Apple is giving you money, you-tuber guys. It is only possible to compare iPad and Mac once or until all apps for which a laptop is used will be optimized for iPad. Even though all PC apps don&#39;t work on Macs yet, they daydream. For the price of one tablet you can get s pc with a 4090 and 7800x3d. Brah This iPad is more than 2x the price of my friends gaming pc with 3080Ti Did you also see the 11 inch one? If yes is there a difference in the display like the 12.9&quot; and the 11&quot; on the older iPad? Short answer “Because I have money” A few days ago I bought a Redmi Pad Se for €210 and compared to my old tablet which was around €110, I have to admit that the price really makes a difference, not always, of course, but in my case yes. Regarding this iPad, I think it&#39;s too expensive even though certainly better than most tablets on the market, but again I would never buy it, I think it&#39;s a waste of money. It’s such a waste not having 2 USBC slots and the ability to run normal apps. It’d be a MacBook Air with an amazing touchscreen. Isn&#39;t that foldable with that thickness I can neither confirm nor deny the location of this particular video… I&#39;d love to see a video from you on the Huawei Pura 70! You said the iPad can&#39;t do 100% what a macbook can, true, but also the mackbook cannot do 100% what an ipad can. So just as between iOS and Android , no one device can do it all. And still no multi-user on iPad. If you need to create a whole video just to convince yourself purchasing this ipad, then you’re not the public for the device. <br>Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great product for professional creatives (designers, illustrators, animators, etc), but a macbook is more oriented for other type of professional public (coders, etc.). In the end if you want it, go ahead and share your experience…. I want to convince myself it’s a good option.<br>Comment sent from an ipad pro 12.9 from 2018 😅😁 <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/Z8MfY8mzLbnovwK5roC4Bg\"></a> The greatest youtube and netflix machine ever madeee.... This is a scam and you should be ashamed of yourself. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEE HERE. All this already existed in 2021 when I bought the M1 iPad. It can’t do anything a MacBook can do. Hell it doesn’t even have a calculator app. <br><br>This guy has been bought off I am curious, do you use the majority of the 8TB on your mac? I&#39;m very much a &quot;get the max options on everything&quot; kind of guy, but when purchasing my Macbook a year or so ago, I ended up limiting myself to only 1TB, and its been great and I&#39;m nowhere close to using it all. Obviously with content creation you will have a ton more files, hence me being curious about how much storage space is truly taken up out of the 8TB. big gigabytes How many of you got a Samsung ad before the start of this video🤣💀 Apple realised that samsung&#39;s s9 series were trending, so they wanted to be on the spotlight The answer to the vid title is: <br><br>So I could make a YouTube video about it, and get the money back instantly from views Me reading the title: &quot;You did WHAT&quot; The new M1 iPad Pros are great devices but the problem has always been the same since the first iPad Pro, the software. Like having the M4 chip which is capable of so much more than iOS can offer. That is why Apple should make the iPad Pro run MacOS so it can have way better apps to utilize its internal specs. Apple wont do this though because they dont want internal competition with the MacBook Air because the air would basically be pointless with the iPad keyboard and the iPad would still be a better deal. I&#39;ll buy a pc with this amount of money At this point over half the video is talking about it because he is too scared to buy it Imagine spending 4k on a tablet....wtf is wrong with people. I feel like there may be a slight increase in battery life for the new iPad Pro based on 2 factors that can be observed during the presentation. The M4 Chip powering the iPad is stated to have 50% more efficiency for a specific amount of power which might help when powering 2 OLED Panels at the same time depending on the workflows you are doing. I think it would be interesting to see a battery life comparison for the M2 and M4 iPads. You spend because doing a review is your job, so constantly you have to upgrade to incite users.,  From next time don&#39;t use such cheesy lines like why I spent this much on that😂 In an earlier video, you mentioned that you could not split screen on mac, this is actually possible by making it no longer full-screen and going to the window tab above They should have made the new pencil compatible with M1 ipads at least. I can finally induce headache with an ipad! the durability tests for this thing are going to be damning... I particularly love the explanation and the way you differentiated a MacBook and iPad, really wish I can get that iPad cos am a student, it gonna go a long way.<br><br>Thanks Mrwhosetheboss There are plenty of devices far cheaper with far more capabilities than the iPad. Honestly, if you&#39;re dead set on an iPad Pro , just buy an M1 iPad second-hand, even that is total overkill This M4 chip tab <br>Has NPU ? <br>of 16 core or more.<br>Because <br>M1 M2 M3 in laptop and in I Mac has 16 Core NPU<br><br>But in I pad of M1 M2 ,  I didn&#39;t know , that NPU is present or not ? <br><br>Please ans <br>And suggest I pad  with NPU Chip <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=601\">10:01</a> absolutely wild statement. I still much prefer not having to install an app. I really could not care less about the thickness. I have my eye on the M3 model now though. WWhen I saw the price, my soul slowly withered. Expense wise, it&#39;s getting right up there with the gaming laptop I want (ROG Asus Strix, pick whatever year cause they&#39;re all expensive). I&#39;ve also been on the fence about getting one at all when my old one still works (Lenovo Legion Y740 I think, forgot the numbers), it just has a terrible battery life and constantly gives static electric shock when you don&#39;t use it on a flat surface. Just seeing the numbers of the new iPad made me realize &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t need anything new when my old ones still work&quot;. You can&#39;t draw on a 1200 laptop most of the time So you pretty much bought an iPod that just happens to be wider and longer and happens to come with a stylus I use the iPad Mini for my flying. It holds my flight manuals, navigational charts and other essential documents, electronic flight bags. Who got Samsung Ads between this video 😂😂 Regarding your storage issue, instead of paying for icloud you could remote connect to a full pc over the ipad and have both a fully granular filesystem and also tons of storage which is expandle if it fills up. Then sync it up to a 95&#39;&#39; oled tv via the apple tv in 4K/8K, then it will be awesome! I hope you were able to convince yourself with your own video. It’s clear you know it’s not worth it at all. But hey, new toys! Dex laughing from the corner At this point you justifying your expense that u never needed It feels like this thin ipad looks very delicate and  might break &amp; also bend when it falls . <br>All money will be gone in one go. Bro why do you have 10 samsung adverts in a this short of a video 😮\\u200d💨 I am watching this in a iPad Pro 5 ( 12.9 inch) If the ipad was ever synced with macOS - it would be an easy, straightforward purchase for me. Even if it ran above two thousand. But if it remains only on iOs, then the mini does perfectly what i need. I feel like this one he was paid by Apple Overpriced. Sadly, the software is not there and never going to be until they make it a true computer Hmm! Think you got swept up by the Apple event, I&#39;d be very surprised if you don&#39;t end up returning this one. How much?... I disagree on the part about the apps working better on mobile. I am actually the complete opposite; if I am doing any extensive work I purposely make sure I work on a pc. Browsers I find work better on pc and I use a lot of engineering/coding apps like MATLAB which have a terrible mobile version. Even the YouTube app is bad, it feels like Google has made it significantly worse performing over the past year. Maybe it is different for creator apps like the photo editing you mentioned. Because your head isn&#39;t cooperating 😂 Just get a pc at this price Obscene is the right word. Replace your phone too brother  😅 With all that power, Apple still did not have courage to put MacOS on iPad. What a disgrace. Still no multi-window feature like Samsung? What kind of productivity is this?? Can I give suggestions for ipad software team? <br>-make a button on keyboard that can on/unlock screen without ever touch ipad if use keyboard<br>-make a software like totally same to powerpoint/word/pdf that can read and edit on it<br>-make gaming accessories for ipad (cause it can showoff its power right?) I know it’s click bait but bro it’s working and why!!!!? Bro paid a semester for it 😮 The cost of it equals to a normal pc please do drop test and bend test too🙂 Yea nah. iOS is so limited The issue remains with iPadOS - even with many improvements over the years you won&#39;t be happy with it in the long run - especially if you in ❤️ with Finder.... and if you need (for your job) a few desktop apps that are still very awkward to use (Excel, Horizon...). Is anybody here who&#39;s life majorly revolves around chrome extensions? Does it solve this problem? Perfect for me to use my boeing fleet app for aircraft maintenance engineering. Okay, this is cool, but when will they make a touchscreen MacBook Pro? What important is not thickness but functional.. in daily task.. 😂😂😂<br>Not like phone bring anywhere and anytime.. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=77\">1:17</a> I use my tablet for art. And we’re millions. I use my M2 12.9’ more than anything. I take it everywhere. My 15PM and M3 Ultra collect dust majority of the day. I do upgrade everything continuously lol No one will never see this. If you use any open source software, then ipadOS is a non-starter as a daily driver Why do I feel outdated with my iPad now 😅 He almost convinced me to buy new iPad until I checked my bank account Same lol 🤣😂🤣😂🤣👍🏽👌🏾 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Same😢 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Yeah, lack of money is the reason I don&#39;t get things too. Womp womp look for convertibles, this new device sounds like a convertible with apples phone os and thinner to me. Convertibles are laptops with a touchscreen where the keyboard can be flipped at the back or removed. The most famous convertible (not the best i think) is the Microsoft Surface series I didn&#39;t even need to check😔 😂😂😂 now stop it we cant be cruel to Bank Managers……actually dont think I have a bank manager its all online lol but until my iPad Pro goes belly up I am not parting with my overdraft for any brilliant pad ………..although I could just go to Apple Store and check it out I mean no harm in that is there??? 😂 @@aria_cyphersniff no that feeling . I think we are not alone a few billion of us at least @@xbelibigermensch3585i have an iPad Pro couple years old forget generation. But I got apple keyboard and love it. Funny thing is I dont seem to take it off keyboard lol which is odd because I always use to use iPad Pro I had before this one as a proper tablet . Me 2😂 same，And I don&#39;t have a job now I&#39;ll stick to my Motorola g70 tablet for now 😂 😂😂😂😂😂 Where&#39;s your sweatshirt from? Why don’t these guys get the actual device and then do the review ! He will do another one when he gets one , yet the thumbnail shows that he has one ! nice review you are right, better than markybrown, maybe time to swith to ipad os, but whiners will whine Tablets😮 Random question, but what was the photoediting app he was using? Is it Pixelmator? Same arguement can be said for smart watch, why use a smart watch when a phone can do almost everything smart watch can do minus the heart rate monitor The most expensive YouTube player I am assured now that tv companies will utilise the dual led screen tech to make new tvs panels. I&#39;m so confused. Everything you mentioned about the new iPads replacing your laptop, the old ones can do ALL the same things except the Pencil Pro, which still is a very niche market compared to standard Apple Pencil (2nd gen) users. <br><br>I don&#39;t get why the M1/M2 iPad couldn&#39;t replace your computer given they function the same (because of the limited non-computer style iOS); meaning it still isn&#39;t a MacBook in any way, still much lighter than your MacBook, and have ZERO difference in performance when you didn&#39;t talk about gaming in your day-to-day lifestyle. The old iPads also never got hot either. That issue was solved when iPad went to &quot;M&quot; chips.<br><br>Truthfully, it just sound like you&#39;re just catching on late, because you didn&#39;t give the previous &quot;M&quot; series a real world chance. These new models are not worth it when you can get an M1/M2 for much less; especially after release of these new iPads.<br><br>End of story. So much power and no designated calculator app, this has to be some kind of inside joke ipad will never replace a laptop . I can move files from my a android phone to my pc The average person does not need that ipad 😅 For that money they better give me mac os and iPad OS iPad Air went from M1 to M2. iPad Pro went from M2 to M4. That is why they were comparing M4 to M2. M3 was skipped over completely for the iPad To be fair M4 chip without 3.5mm jack is still useless for video editing if you&#39;re not an artist or a graphic designer or a massive couch potato, then iPad is the worst device to buy even after coming 10years.<br>Tell me a thing that your iPad can do but not not iPhone, iPad = big iPhone. And this is coming from a former iPad pro user, and I absolutely hated it, its not about hardware its about software limitation. This makes no sense, why when there’s a spec bump (that literally doesn’t matter because it’s already too fast for its software) and it’s just a little bit thinner can it replace your laptop. It’s the same tablet as the year before and the year before that im still waiting to get a new ipad 9th gen for the first time I have had an ipad with cellular service since 2018 and have never regretted it. I have very little issues with connectivity even when going to another country as long as I make the proper plans for the service. I have plenty of video and files stored on the tablet so dead areas never cause me any more than a minor inconvenience. I will say that unfortunately I have had to get used to carrying a messenger bag for the ipad and accessories which does include back up storage. I find it convenient enough and carry it around everywhere. I even use my 12.9 inch iPad for the grocery stores app while shopping. 3600 to watch netflix. OOF That screen buzzle is disgusting Missing cores on lower tier ram options is just deceptive. <br>Should only be one version of the M4. I think we gotta wait to see if iPadOS 18 will take advantage of all this new “power” Swapping my 15 inch M2 MacBook Air 16gb for the 13 inch M4 iPad Pro and keyboard. My photography business runs on a dual monitor Mac Studio setup (with all the speed and screen real estate I need). The iPad will be far more versatile for my mobile and entertainment needs. Welcome to the Dark Side. 😂<br>I live in the Apple ecosphere, happily. <br>Apple IIe owner, even. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=258\">4:18</a> hello apple users samsung DEX exists Why they don&#39;t give anti reflective coting when  they have the technology Is this video sponsored because i couldn&#39;t get the genuinity that arun presents in the this videos Why you got the newest iPad??<br>-“YouTube, Safari and Occasional sketching” Can we open two excel sheets at the same time 😅 can you get me a ds Sooooo....the iPad is just a hobby machine. <br><br>As an architect it amazes me how Apple boasts about being designer friendly while having NO DAMN APP OR PROGRAM that we use work well with their environment.<br><br>But sure, let&#39;s drop $3,600 on a tablet that doesn&#39;t do anything a $1,000 laptop could do. Also, you&#39;ve been talking a lot about the keyboard and the pencil, how much more are those worth? Surely for the exact experience you&#39;re talking about, $3600 falls waaaaaay too short of a price. You didn&#39;t spend, you invested in creating a video on YouTube and then made more money.... Not like your subscribers that will really spend a lot of money for nothing 😂 I will never understand why people let Apple get away with a $1,000 up charge for just 2TB of storage. I hate being forced to install an app. Websites on pc can home a lot more information. Who is there waiting for new version of iPad Mini with new chip and OLED screen? tell me why For me the iPad Pro 2018 is still a great device - specs aren’t as good as this but they are still good enough for many actual users of tablets I use cheap Moto phones and old Dell quad core biz desktops that I get for $60, add a $20 SSD and install Zorin. I design stuff on a pad of graph paper with a pencil. I feel fulfilled. If you gave me a billion dollars, I would not change anything. Overpriced, overhyped piece of E-WASTE. Come on man iPadOS is so limited compared to macOS. It’s literally no comparison at the moment. Not sure how anyone can consider it as a replacement. Free Palestine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=577\">9:37</a><br>He is dancing. Without vaccines. I just wish samsung would make a magic keyboard for their tab ultra line. I’d never even look at an ipad again. The galaxy tab includes the pen, is cheaper, is water resistant, has SD card support, and that 14 inch display is SO much better. Is it waterproof?.. bro bought a $3,600 ipad, and he has many, MANY! exclusive phones, like a $1000 worth of subscriptions, fully maxed out computers, like every phone, the apple vision pro, every macbook, every playstation, nintendo and xbox console and handheld, and bro still has money! dang he must have robbed richie rich Angry birds in oled! Why did you spend $3600 on a iPad? Because you wanted to make a YouTube video and get that cash money duh Umm lol because you have done amazingly well for yourself and can afford to buy one ! Good for you .thats 2 months rent for my 2 bedroom lol .thanx for sharing the experience tho...my daughter wants one lol as if you can use the m4 chip Because HES  RICH… apple makes loser products for losers lol sent from my iPhone Only one reason: you can afford it. Some laptops can have cellular service! Not saying you shouldn&#39;t get one... I have a pro 12.9 from a couple years ago. I mainly use it for CODM. In the US, without accessories, you can spec the Pro 13inch, 2tb, wifi plus cellular, nano texture glass to $2599. I would have ordered the nano textured glass, but I couldn&#39;t stomach the extra $700. I don&#39;t need an extra core or 744GB more storage. I felt like I was way overpaying as it was. $1,883.62 including tax, Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil. Maybe I should have bought the Air instead of the Pro but I made my decision and I&#39;m sticking to it. Veri nice video from Bangladesh watching boss&#39;s videos on 4x speed cuz i got no time but wanna hear the in depth reviews Seriously, I’m all for increasingly better tablets!  I spend most of my time on my tablet, reading news, playing casual games, watching youtube/movies, displaying recipes in my kitchen, working from “anywhere”, etc!  Phones are great, but the screen real estate of a tablet is 10 fold better!  I continuously want a very powerful, responsive, stable tablet so I can continue to do these things with modern content and data speeds without getting frustrated and waiting for “processing to happen”.  Sure, I spend a lot of time on my laptop because it has 2 additional monitors and I can do more work at once when that’s necessary.  I also have my PC for epic fun gaming when I have the time.  But between work and gaming, I’m more on my iPad than any other device for the day to day tasks.  So I say keep’em coming! ^.^<br><br>Edit: ok $3600 is a bit steep, but I would have no issue paying that because I’m confident that will last me through the next decade.  So $3600 for a device that is gonna last as long as that is totally worth it IMHO.  I spent over $5000 on my gaming PC, and I don’t expect that to last more than 3 years before it starts to suck… let&#39;s admit it, iPad Pro is basically overkill in every aspect while apple is limiting its capabilities/iPadOS to stop it from killing the macbook&#39;s market Mmm a 16 minuts 11 second apple advertisement. As to why? Because you can.. And like another person has said: your a tech reviewer, and can afford it. To me its &#39;just a nerfed macbook&#39;. sitting in a coffee shop to sketch something isn&#39;t a thing. Wanting a drawing pad,however, is one. I still think the samsung galaxy tab s9 ultra is the best, I ain&#39;t buying apple That is ridiculous, to spend the price of a used car, on a tablet Most positive vid in the iPad stuff… but it also sounds like you’re new to iPads/only tried a demo of it. Arun made a video to justify his purchase On Remarkable, there&#39;s less distractions <br>On the iPad, I keep meaning to read/draw and i&#39;m somehow 2 hours in youtube and twitter Upcoming video:world lightest gadgets😂😂 macbook pro $999 this nerfed mac tablet $3600 this is for people who have a mac alrdy or for people who dont care about money. get a home nas for like 2800 you can get 96 terabites of storage thats decently fast and a prebuild nas that is small and looks good The other day, my son quietly yelled Android forever in front of a mac store ( opps i meant to say Apple).

So in conclusion awesome product, too expensive Hi Arun, fantastic production as usual mate. colouring amazing. so looking forward to my new products, certified apple fan boy so super excited. Embarrassing A paid commercial. No matter what an iPad will never replace a laptop with its current states. Apple is so expensive and they release the same thing every year!!!!<br><br>Here’s me giving them $4,000 Lets wait for x elite :D I think whatever they do with iPadOS will show us if it will be a laptop killer. For me, it&#39;s a no-go because Premiere Pro and After Effects don&#39;t exist for the iPad, though 😊 people always say “why wouldn’t you just spend that money on a mac?” and you nailed it, THE APPS<br><br>nearly every single one is better on ipad/iphone nothing samsung hasn&#39;t had for years now I would not spend that much on a product that breaks easily. Waiting for JerryRigEverything to do his thing Yikes that’s too far Feels like this is a video for the wife trying to convince her to allow the huge purchase Meanwhile, jerryrigeverything new ipad fold...😂😂😂 You hyped the iPad so much man. It&#39;s software is still lackluster and featureless I went smaller on my newest phone and use my iPad mini for most things. I have the last generation iPadPro with the logitech folio case. It is amazing. I have not used my personal laptop for more than 8 months. In work, whenever I work in remote (like 80% of the time) I use my tablet. Highly recommended! And what do you mean with &quot;work&quot;? How many people do you think that work in the same area that you? It&#39;s a simple question. @@franciscodiaz5778 i am a marine surveyor. I mostly use my table for emails, access to the company sharepoint and for drawing handling (I use pdf versions of the drawings and make notes on the pdf using the apple pen).<br><br>Anyone that is using sharepoint and microsoft applications like teams, onedrive, outlook etc. (which I believe is most of us) can use the iPad Pro instead of the laptop.

Keep it up guys 💪 M4 iPad Pro for $3600? you know its deep when you have to make a video without the item to afford paying for the item Bro telling us broke folk how he just spent his bread to test expensive stuff Waiting for Apple to put M1 in an iPhone lol <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=380\">6:20</a> wait but I squeeze my pencil when I draw Crazy vid, it shows how hard you work as you could see like the outside getting darker! Considering this runs iOS this feels like a paid ad lol It&#39;s like making audience &quot;somehow&quot; convince that this gen iPad is better Some valid points. Most people just need photo managing app, browser and YouTube. That&#39;s why my mom has Chromebook You can’t even play Fortnite on the M4 LOL Anyone know what E-ink tablet he is using? I still can&#39;t use a tablet because of the apple limitations of the actually good tablets. Dudes a shill 3600 dollars for a tablet. Nah I&#39;m good with pc Unless apple opens up things on iPad and we can start running mac apps in some way, iPad will always be of limited use / useless for me For 3600 might as well get a dope pc and a camera This is shilling on another level! Who buys a Mac for Games... I know I never did. They’re people out there that find a lot of value in an iPad but not $3600 worth of value. They should just do what they did with the iPod for a while. Super bulk make it then just leave it there so those who need it can buy it and if demand is really that bad just leave till supply runs out. Is it foldable 🤡🤣 You can still return it I&#39;m a windows user but for tablet, iPad is light years ahead from competitor. Apple already releases M4 Tablet, never seen a single Tablet using X Elite or Core Ultra. Can I have your macbook pro if you don&#39;t want it anymore? ◡̈ I have never had a Mac, always a windows laptop and mid tower. The only apply products I’ve ever had are iPhone and AirPods. I never thought I’d want my next laptop to be an iPad. Without even watching we all know coz you are a Apple fan boy. Whatever that floats your boat brother 😂 Keep buying Chinese stuff and giving your data to the Chinese government It&#39;s definitely mind-blowing how technology continues to evolve, making everything more compact yet more powerful. As a MacBook user, shifting to an iPad as a main device sounds like a bold move. However, with the potential to do better in terms of gaming, photo editing, and even video editing, it could be worth the risk. video editing won&#39;t be good lol imagine 50% slower render 💀 @@KenScepterNah, is not render Speed, Literally there is no other editing video program on iPad than LumaFusion, and FCP 💀💀 I still like a big screen.

Excellent information. I like the questions that you still have remaining. Those are the exact same questions that I’m thinking about at the current time as to whether to update my iPad Pro, which I just purchased in December of last year. But I am going to be doing more YouTube videos And editing possibly. Right now I edit on my windows desktop computer computer. I’m also concerned about the battery life. I get so frustrated sometimes when my battery goes down to like 3% I plug it in for the night and when I come back in the morning, about six or seven hours later it’s not 100% and I’ve been working with the Support team to remove a whole bunch of stuff that I don’t need in order to get a better, longer battery life. And you’re absolutely right why would I need one or 2 TB when I can plug-in, something to have that. I still have a lot of questions. I have cellular on my current iPad. But it doesn’t let me do much. I just can’t answer her phone call if it comes in and my cell phone, which is an iPhone 15 Pro, isn’t by my side. you did answer one question that I had was whether my external magic keyboard works on the new one. I prefer the external one because then I don’t always have to carry it. Well again, or questions. Until I get answers, I’m not going to order a new one. $3600! I think that’s worth more than my car. Chuckling. how does that conversion even ake sense i thought the dollar was equal to a pound now This is the dumbest line up, I WANT ONE!!!! dammm bro 256 gb is enough for me with some 4k video editings but how can you use 8tb of storage and get it full cause you have it? That’s a cool shirt Answer he’s rich Still no calculator 😂 use a thunderbolt SSD for storage, I have a Sabrent Rocket for my Ipad its great, i have a bit of velcro tape on the ipad case and on the ssd to take it on and off and i also have velcro on my desktop and my laptops for when i move the SSD between the 3 devices Nope, I&#39;ve seen this scene before with Apple. Them making a thin device = bendgate 2.0 I wonder how many people even end up using its full power.😂 Need to sell my kidney to buy 😅😅 &quot;my Massive laptop&quot;. Dude. That&#39;s a thin and light laptop. This video is an excuse for a tax write off 😆 Go a Lenovo Yoga tablet,,it&#39;s got a built in handle.. and  dont have to deal with. Apple... Puns are definitely getting worse Your next video should be I bought every Sega console I wanted 15 inch iPads. Question: Would the nano-screen act more paper-like for the pencil as opposed to the glossy screen? I bought the Air 5 just the moment it came out back in 2022 and now im here contemplating if i should sell it and get the new ipad pro 2024. The new pro an amazing piece of tech but i know im only going to be using it for watching movies and writing documents 😅 $FINDME A KOI It&#39;s probably good to read a book on, with its double display and all. It&#39;s much easier to replace a phone with a foldable. That&#39;s why conscious consumers like us have a z fold 4. Imagine buying apple products intentionally though...😅 I usually really like your videos, but this one feels vey much like clickbait, a deadly sin for any serious content creator. 99% of users do not need a configuration that will cost $3,600. You might want that configuration ,but most people do not. I wish you trusted that your content was relevant (because it is) without needing to resort to tactics that really jeopardize a creator’s credibility. I believe you are better than that.

Hell, if i wanted a phone + computer, id get an s24 ultra...which has Samsung dex, or id get a phone and a good computer. This really doesn&#39;t seem loke a smart purchase at all We live in a world where apple charges 400€ for a keyboard and trackpad.<br>I don’t think I even want to know the profit margin on that As an architect, this iPad has been very useful. Having a full 3D model of an office park in your hand is amazing during construction. You got this already??

The M4 iPad Pro has not been released yet. It goes on sale May 15. My Cellular M1 iPad Pro has been my favourite purchase for years now id definitely recommend cellular for those who travel. I think an M4 Pro is in my future. It would be perfect if it can run MacOS but of course Apple wont do that because it will cannibalize Macbook sales and also MacOS is not designed to be touch-friendly. Maybe give it a &quot;Dex&quot; mode? Bought the remarkable tablet to replace paper notebooks. Nothing more, nothing less. Don’t have a laptop, use the iPad Pro M2. Won’t buy the M4 iPad Pro. Not worth the upgrade. The Samsung Galaxy Tab9 Ultra does all of that and has DEX The thing about iPads for me is that, sure, they’re excellent hardware and I love their form factor - but their operating system is so limited. Once I switched from iPhone to Android and my phone and tablet no longer talked properly, it felt like all I had left was essentially a very pretty chromebook with a touchscreen. All the power of an M1 chip, but nothing I do on it feels any faster than it does on a Snapdragon.<br><br>There were a few key features that kept it from being a true laptop replacement for me - things I needed to do that simply were not on the App Store, and because of no sideloading, I couldn’t do them. Points where due, it was my favorite way to do the things I did on my phone up until the moment half of them became impossible for me to do on an Apple-branded tablet, and my only regret was that I spent $900 on a 256gb Air 5 and accessories when I could’ve been happy spending $600 on a 64gb iPad 10 and lower end accessories - but it loses a lot of points for becoming a really nice paperweight the moment the ecosystem disappeared from around it.<br><br>Anyway, I just ordered a Tab S8 Ultra refurbished for $470 to hopefully recapture what the iPad did, as well as what I hoped it would do - be better at doing things I did on my phone when I have it with me, and also do all the things I do on a laptop (every Windows productivity tool I use is available on Android either natively or with a workaround). Bruh, what a pain in the ahh when someone bends it by accident 💀 LOLS...better buy PC than this crap device. we can buy tablet way cheaper than this but also powerful for daily use. This is too much from apple. Crazy but nothing is special on this device lols. be wise on spending... Can&#39;t install macOS on it......... What a piece of <b>**</b> it&#39;s definitely not worth $3,600 just because of that single fact Hopefully with iPad OS18 this new iPad will be more functional.

Already seen MKBHDs take. i feel you both have two different prospective. same mofos buyin new phones and $3.5k tablets every year are the same people complaining about a $500 game console First of all, you have Money. 8T, Arun? Before even watching this video, let’s be real about your thumbnail. “Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4”. You did it because you’re privileged enough to where that kind of money is not an issue to you whatsoever, because it’s a business write off, a clickbaity and engaging title for a new video, and because your line of work pays disproportionally high vs the vast majority of others who put in the same hours into different careers. Movies on ipad pro sucks because aspect ratio means it&#39;s mildly bigger than iPhone max for the size of a macbook air.

No matter how much he tries to say “it’s amazing!” It still just a tablet. Then you want to copy a file somewhere. You&#39;ll find it still sucks on an iPad, not matter how fast and how light and how thin the new shiny thing is. Or try copying or moving a photo [or video] from an Android phone to an iPad; like copying a video clip to edit on an iPad in LumaFusion. 👎🏻No matter how highly you praise an iPad, its limitations are clear.

Almost everybody who has a career that is not content creation and requires a laptop will not be able to replace it with any iPad. The iPad is purposely designed to just be right on the edge to be able to replace a laptop, enough so that you think it will and you buy it but you still also end up buying a laptop anyways. Trust me guys the tab s9 is superior and more fun to use.  One of the best I&#39;ve owned . It comes w s pen in box , is water proof, <br>has micro SD card,  has open operating system etc.  Also apple got that apple pencil idea from Samsung Because you are not smart. if this thing had what the samsung tablets had, and mac app support, then id be worth it at this level of thin, it has to have some kind of endoskeleton. or else it will be bent within a week. you are a pro video editor, how can you be considering replacing a real computer It feels like Apple is really trying to stall as long as they can before finally just making a touch screen MacBook. How long til they make an iPad with a pro level processor, and a sturdy enough keyboard with ports that can just merge the two products? It would be an absolutely amazing, single device. Hmmm. I&#39;ll keep my Amazon HD Tablet. 99 bucks. Perfect. Ipad has a light version of Microsoft office that&#39;s sucks... can&#39;t do VBA can&#39;t have all excel normal function to work like a pro....

Big PC Houses to Desktop PC to Laptops to Ipads. smaler Bro I’m telling this was a bad decision iPads have indeed made significant strides as laptop replacements, and for many, they serve that purpose well. Yet, personally, nothing quite compares to the reliability of a MacBook, with its sturdy hinge and the convenience of an operating system meticulously designed for seamless mouse and keyboard interaction. While the distinction between the two is narrowing, at the moment an iPad is still an iPad for me. i feel him turning into mumbo jumbo NOPE. I guess I’m done with Apple. Why the need to go thinner and thinner. I&#39;d prefer a bit thicker than the last model, leading to a heck more battery life. I have an explanation: stupidity But does it run Fusion the audio sounds bad Give us Mac OS on iPad and I’m in Wow you finally get your first touch screen Mac as an iPad 😂 what a surprise that Apple it’s pushing the iPad as replacement, shocking 😮 Cause you&#39;re not very smart Nice, nice...Can I have ur MacBook anyways? <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a>Most powerful Youtube and Netflix machine. <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a> Bro trying to get featured on the next Apple keynote 😅 I also ordered the maxed spec&#39;d iPad Pro 13&quot;.

I realize that the UK price, converted to US$ is much higher than that, but the title is somewhat misleading. IMO, better to just list the UK price in £ instead. All of this is just a cute spec bump unless iPad OS is updated like it should be this year. Otherwise  unless you have money to burn just buy a used iPad I can’t wait to see Jerryrigeverything fold this in half like a piece of paper Sorry, I&#39;m not spending top shelf desktop money on a tablet. Period. That&#39;s a 4080 almost 4090 perbuilt turf. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the”justification” section of a successful direct marketing campaign; he’s been won over by the device on an emotional level, he’s now sure he wants to make the purchase, but he needs to justify it to himself first by saying “it has great specs, it’s so powerful, it could solve this problem for me, or make that task easier” etc. And when he’s thoroughly convinced himself, he’ll hit “buy”. Apple’s marketing wins again! But in all seriousness this new iPad Pro is a very impressive piece of tech. Especially for those who use their iPads for art purposes. Hope you don’t stress too much 🙄 Why not to make 14.6 inch tablet? @mrwhosetheboss I’m sure they will release at WWDC a software feature that will allow iPad Pro to operate as macOS when docked to the Smart Keyboard.

The screen on it&#39;s own makes we want to upgrade from my old basic iPad just for my super basic iPad use cases. I&#39;m gonna have to disagree on the software front. The locked-down nature of iPadOS is the biggest weakness of the iPad Pro. You did mention the file management, which is huge. On my Android, I use a third party file manager that works super well and is feature rich. Additionally, apps can have access to the file system directly, which is critical for local music players. In terms of games, you need to pay a subscription for most good games. This applies to most software as well, and I really hate renting software. On Mac, and especially Windows and Linux, there is a treasure trove of great free (as in beer AND as in freedom!) software that is focused on the user rather than emptying your wallet. $3,600 😮 Apple don&#39;t actually make their own screens, it&#39;s probably made by Samsung You made several rather strange,  subjective and misinformed comments. Just had to voice this. The fact apple called the new  apple pencil. &quot;Apple pencil &quot;pro&quot;. It&#39;s basically apple pencil 3rd generation I might be missing something but I have kind of been using an tablet like this since 2015. Windows surface has been my travel computer for processing image&#39;s during my world trip. It been my main laptop since then. Uppgraded once. \\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff\\uf8ff Imahine calling 2TB a small amount of storage seriously just get an M4 pro mac mini when it comes out. like u will save so much money and get better performance Hello should I trade my old iPad m3 for the new one With most apps are on web nowdays (google apps, microsoft 365), better portability, and most importantly, can use the same charger as iphone, i would choose ipad as mac replacement. Apple will stop macbook, and sell ipad with separate sell for pencil, keyboard case and trackpad. And just charging cable in the box It&#39;s about time a good executor got released! I wonder how wave is going to be... levi7147 Ok but why is it iOS and not MacOS Who is tablet for ? Didn&#39;t watch the video just saw the title - you&#39;re nuts ! So its a laptop that lacks the adaptability i want from a laptop, plus being a good touch screen i guess? no thanks Waste of money could build a sick PC for that, Apple are a rip off. Damn right. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=477\">7:57</a> realize that the camera changes and reappears 😮 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=477\">7:57</a> $3600.  How much of Steam&#39;s catalog can it run? But he&#39;s going to get so much &quot;gaming utility&quot; out of it. Very cool. In actual reality what do we need an ipad cost of a high end laptop ?<br>I aint spending 2-3 times the budget of my gaming laptop to watch youtube/netflix or ipad kids Don&#39;t do it! Perhaps you could make a review on the best iPad case with all its different user preferences? I would love to see the pro’s and cons between the Logitech combo touch and the apple Magic Keyboard Remarkable needs backlighting and it&#39;s not enough responsive, don&#39;t buy it! answer : &quot;i&#39;m a youtuber with 18.5 million and i love to spend just little money for tempting my audience Why he brush his teeth like that. Not replacing a MacBook as long as iPad OS remains what it is. most expensive ipads... yet Let&#39;s burn money for fun. For me I think WWDC is going to decide if I  get this new one or not. The M2 is more then capable enough. I didn&#39;t see anything during the keynote at least for my  use case that appealed to me. My iPad has pretty much replaced my  need for a laptop. I have a Windows desktop if I need to do some  serious heavy lifting, and my iPad handles everything else. I use DaVinci Resolve and it handles find on my iPad for my needs. My photo work is all done via Darkroom  and  now Lightroom (Capture One was a dumpster fire at launch and I haven&#39;t looked back at it).  Honestly I was really skeptical at first, but the iPad has become my favorite Apple thing. It’s good for reading Nope, iPadOs is different from MacOs. It won&#39;t feel like a MacBook, until developers of the app make it so. Event using canva is different on ipad, better on macbook 😢<br><br>The advantage point of this ipad is, you&#39;ll get a bigger, lighter extra screen for your MacBook From being a big phone to a small laptop, tablets have come a long way They should just add MacOS as a boot feature on the ipad $3600 for half of the performance and less capabilities of an already pricey MacBook. I&#39;ve never seen a video of you that felt like grasping for straws like this one. This really felt like an ad, but i know it isn&#39;t. However, i&#39;m happy you found a product you&#39;re excited about. Pricer than Vision Pro I didn&#39;t see it that way, I saw it as he finally found a tablet that actually fits in his life. How is it half the performance? What about Microsoft surface? of a macbook pro* it exceeds the capabilities of the most recent macbook air. It’s more powerful than MacBooks with m4 its the os that’s limited @@Staralium iPad 1TB, nano texture + pencil pro + keyboard costs $2677 in the US. Vision Pro costs $3900. As M1 iPad Pro user i would never upgrade to any other iPad until they remove virualization restrictions, remove background app restrictions, add launchctl, make Xcode for iPadOS and replace this weird cursor with the normal one. @@jonathanodude6660Other MacBooks have a fan while this doesn’t. @@shahbazfawbushI hate my damn surface it works like absolute shit @@Youtuber-ku4nk It&#39;s not. He doesn&#39;t know what he is talking about. The M4 iPad Pro has higher performance than any MacBook because no MacBook has an M4 yet. All that power to run a mobile OS. Why Apple are still subjecting its hardware to this easy work is beyond me....why aren&#39;t iPads running MacOS? If they&#39;re as powerful as Apple say, then it should be easy. Shut up apple and take ma money More expensive, worse battery life, removed a camera, cant use old accessories... With this amount you can buy an iphone 15, macbook and airpods.  You cant replace laptops or pc it is fhat simple. Yes phones are getting better and tablets but the main gadget for work remains the laptop or pc. You can get the latest inter core ultra or any sort of amd cpu either threadripper or ryzen, 4080 or 4090 and it will be undeniably better. I like the fact that you don&#39;t have an iphone. Don&#39;t get sucked into their closed off ecosystem. Because you are a youtuber and you do reviews Brah that tooth brush scene was suspect lol Uh you literally have a vid on this channel from only a few years ago about how the previous iPad model is so amazing and efficient and is invaluable to you at work, and now you&#39;re suddenly &quot;not a tablet guy&quot; and the thought of buying a tablet is weird to you? The price is way too much, in the current economic environment, you have all the tech and too much money at your disposal to judge these things accurately, apple need badly calling out for their walled garden practices, user freedom impingement, lack of control over their own data within the apple ecosystem, and you have a responsibility to do this on behalf of consumers. As you deleted my comment <br>I will be unsubscribing Why did you delete my comment? <br>About can&#39;t wait until you drop it what things in videos that you have reviewed as random/ cheap tech but actually use daily or often!!! @Mrwhosetheboss I wouldn’t buy Apple just wait the price would come down Apple is a greedy company Apple is trying to copy Samsung DeX which is far better experience even with a Samsung phone.<br>People will still buy this for status and not functionality. How the hell is this more expensive than the AVP? I’m watching this knowing I will never have anything expensive $3600? Foolishness... so true you are spitting straight facts mkbhd A 16 mins video just to justify himself in his mind why he wants to spend that amount of money. It&#39;s cos you can afford, due to the hard work you put in over the years. And that&#39;s awesome, and well deserved, 100%!! 😎🙌👊<br><br>Buttttt, on the flip side no one working regular jobs can justify this at all. Nothing is moving me away from Linux! I know that’s what I thought while watching (about the battery life) iPad already looks bent in the thumbnail 😭 As a medical student who replaced my laptop with an iPad (m2) permanently, I do have some serious takes on this. Just as advise. The new iPad pro’s and the old ones have the hardware of a laptop, which is incredible, but there is no way to utilise it properly, since there is not a single app on the iPad available that pushes the CPU and GPU to its max. Besides that, all the apps on the iPad are the phone versions, except for the webbrowsers. Which for me as a student is a huge disadvantage. I miss so many functions in apps like word and excel which are programs I have to use on a day to day basis. With projects I hit a wall very quick because I don’t have all the features you would have on a desktop. And the availability of apps is far more limited on the iPad than on a MacBook or windows laptop. This could be fixed if apple enabled side loading on the iPad, but they already made clear this will likely never happen. I need so many programs for school that the App Store just doesn’t support. It really is a dealbreaker sometimes. I do love the iPad for note taking and studying though. I am much more productive when it comes to studying than I would be if I had a laptop. Goodnotes is a goated app which is my entire file explorer/note taking place. It is so easy so write things down and make incredibly visual summaries. It works so smooth too and I can get a lot more out of studying this way. <br><br>Also I have the Logitech combo touch, and not the Magic Keyboard. And there are 3 key features that make the Logitech case superior for me than the Magic Keyboard. Firstly, the Logitech case offers way more protection, which you would want if you carry a tablet of 1200 euro’s around. Secondly, the keys on the Logitech keyboard are lighter, which I find more pleasant to type on. On days where I have to type a lot, I wouldn’t want my fingers to get tired of the typing. And lastly, you can detach the keyboard from the case magnetically which is SUCH A HANDY feature. I can’t address this enough. You can just snap the keyboard of just like that, while maintaining the protection of the case mostly and you get the kickstand with it. That is so useful. No keyboard in the way and a kickstand. There are countless times where I just snap the keyboard off to showcase something really quick to a classmate or to watch a movie without a keyboard in the way. I do believe that because of that feature it maintains the ‘tablet vibe’ of the combination. If you have your tablet in a keyboard case all day long it is surprisingly easy to forget that it is a tablet and not a desktop. Being able to remove the keyboard just makes it easy to switch to ‘tablet mode’ to put it like that. Also the Logitech keyboard is a lot cheaper.<br><br>I do think that a keyboard case on the iPad is tricky. The Magic Keyboard really makes you believe your iPad is a laptop. Which ofcourse can do similar tasks, but it is easy to forget that touch screen controls will ALWAYS be superior than controlling the iPad via a keyboard and trackpad. That is what a tablet is designed for. The trackpad is very useful, I can’t deny that, but there are plenty of times where I just snap the iPad from the keyboard and use it as a tablet because it is just easier and makes the experience actually more fun. <br><br>The passthrough charging on the case doesn’t really matter to me. I carry an adapter with me at all times, because I need to connect my iPad to an external drive or a monitor quite frequently. The adapter that I have also has a slot for charging the iPad while the adapter is plugged in, so I wouldn’t get much use out of the passthrough charging.<br><br>Be careful with replacing your desktops with an iPad people. It has serious advantages, but also disadvantages that don’t get adressed enough. An iPad is ofcourse very useful and cool, but I think in most cases you would be better off with a laptop. Yet another overpriced piece of crap, which maybe houses some horsepower, but will not be used for anything worth it. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=602\">10:02</a> No, I don’t prefer to download an app for every website/restaurant I visit. Jesus, this is the complete opposite of what I want. Does it have a calculator? Bc ur rich and it’s tax deductible Meh it&#39;s expensive,,,too expensive The video does not make a convincing argument to justify the price. Yes it’s powerful, but almost no apps that utilize that power. Bro, rip remarkable. Oh my guy. You really got me thinking. I was gonna, then after keynote, naw. Now, Hmmmm. Why does it say 3600,<br>It said 4000$ before how much did you spend Looks amazing, I&#39;m the opposite of App first, maybe more than that? On my new MBP M3 Pro, I try to install with brew as much as I can. I&#39;m still eyeing these things though. 😉 another 3600$ paid promotion But it still doesn’t have a built in calculator, right? I hate the title of this video lmao. We get it you got money. Fr The quality of your sweatshirts are insane!!!! Come put me on!! The M1 iPad and Magic Keyboard gives pretty much the same experience. Not sure why people would pay this much for a marginally better experience. Go figure. LOL<br>dude there no way this ipad can do 50% of what your mac book pro can do. sounds like you dpnt utilize your  laptop more then wedbrowsing or youre just too excited. its just another ipad. Watching this video made want one😂 Carry on boys and girls, keeps the shareholders happy. I note that only kings had flush toilets 200 years ago but technological, engineering and manufacturing improvements mean that every bugger has one now. Same with this toy. Meanwhile buy an A4 notepad and take a picture of it to work on later at home on your 30&quot; pc screen. Also Intel hardware is fine, you don&#39;t have to buy Apple. The US dollar is worth less than the pound?..... damn our country is f**ked, lol Ios apps are not better in 3d.....<br>There is no blender or cad? Only fools will buy and shill for such an expensive content consumption device. Greed has it&#39;s limits. $350 for a keyboard. $2000 for an anti reflective coating. Lol. Hey at least $2000 gets you a polishing cloth for free I-Glad? we&#39;re not broken, just bent and we can learn to love again, 😅😅😅 i think it&#39;s too thin It has to be that thin and light because most will put it in a case to protect their investment. Cool Disliked the video as it seems pointless. What&#39;s the app used in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=385\">6:25</a>? i can&#39;t unsee that @ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">00:43</a> I prefer Samsung’s Tab S9 Ultra all day Who was here when we switched to remarkable to focus and cut down on distractions they want to sell a laptop without a keyboard and sell you a keyboard to make it as a laptop Why bro why u can use nas for storage Everything you can do on that, I can do on my basic iPad with a keyboard case and Apple Pencil and I’ll save 3k. Again who’s this aimed at? Stupid gullible people I guess 🤷🏾\\u200d♂️ Google docs? On my Mac I can open five docs at the same time and three next to each other and on the iPad I can maximum two and it&#39;s much more finally and uncomfortable. Ridiculous pricing again by apple ! So good youll still need a mac book pro to use all its feature. So goooooooooddd. You did it because you have money to waste. This dude really spent $3600 on an iPad Dude just hyping everything on iPad right now while forgetting that it&#39;s all literally copied from Android tablets😂😂😂😂😂😂<br><br>Isheep from cave 😂😂😂 I would be interested if it could even do half the things I need on my Mac. I use my Mac for game design, web coding, and open source software. Which to my knowledge isn&#39;t on any iPad. I clicked on this..to say...I DON&#39;T CARE. AN M1 ipad would be good for many years.... Once iPadOS and MacOS are interchangeable and we can use the benefits of these new chips and it full on replaces the laptop THEN it will be a game changer, but to me a 2010 iPad is a 2024 iPad, what&#39;s the difference? It&#39;s usually iPadOs, it&#39;s using apps, it&#39;s using a keyboard and a pencil, it&#39;s a tablet, there&#39;s no reason to own a new iPad if you already own one.<br><br>I think it will be 2026 before anyone actually would &quot;need&quot; an iPad for work or college, until then..enjoy spending £2600 when you could get an M3 MacBook Air probably for the same price. I&#39;m hearing stories that ipad is at last replacement of the laptop for at least 5 years or even more. <br>Now it became best way to identify that video is sponsored by Apple, because they desperately want people to use it not just for watching yt videos and drawing sketches We&#39;re 400,000 subscribers away from the Giant iPhone build video let&#39;s goooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Its all fun and games until you want to run some docker containers. The answer to your question is very simple...<br><br>You are monetizing the contents. You&#39;ll be in for a disappointment when (quickly) learning the limitations of iPad. Hardware in iPad Pro M4 is magnificent. I would trade my (way more powerful) MacBook Pro to iPad Pro if it was just about HW.\\xa0<br><br>Unfortunately apps and OS are just way too limited to ever leave the house without MacBook Pro if you expect to get work done.\\xa0<br><br>Furthermore, Remarkable has a killer feature that iPad can never copy: It does very little. Thus, there are no distractions. Every hyping slim iPad as if that wasn&#39;t on Samsung since beginning of time 😂😂😂😂 Yeah the whole tech thing is really important, but where did you get that sweatshirt from? Love it!!! . OH MY GOD CAN WE STOP COMPARING IPADS TO MAC LAPTOPS!!! It’s not even close, it’ll NEVER be close! I have both a ipad and a MacBook. YouTubers keep insulting our intelligence by comparing iPadOS to a full desktop experience. It’s this a way to justify spending MacBook prices on a tablet. I LOVE iPad but $3000 for iPadOS because that’s what you’re buying,  is just dumb or flexing. Why are you paying all this money for this new iPad Pro M4. Because you have 18.5 million subscribers!! Why would you want to use an Apple product? Could be me, but I don&#39;t see a need for it to be that thin. I like things having thickness. Then it feels like it has worth. Because you know how to waste your money! The hardware is cool and all... but I suppose my issue is, the line between laptop and &quot;big phone&quot; is just an artificial boundary created by Apple. iPads have been powerful enough to literally just run MacOS for years now - there is no technical limitation preventing them from creating a device that does this. They haven&#39;t allowed it because it would cannibalise MacBook sales, so they&#39;ve kept the two user experiences separate. This whole narrative of &quot;it can now do everything a laptop can do!&quot; falls a bit flat for me because... of course it can. If they wanted to, Apple could literally have built a hybrid device that runs iPad OS with it&#39;s not got a keyboard attached, and MacOS when it does. The hardware is all there. Its cool that the iPad experience is getting closer and closer to a true &quot;laptop&quot; experience, but I have yet to see a compelling reason from Apple that explains WHY we are &quot;getting closer&quot;, instead of &quot;already there&quot;, at all. What I can do with iPad, can be done with my phone Bro hates docters bc it&#39;s your job? sounds like the last missing piece to real life star trek datapads is to make them foldable :D Thinnest device ever? What about the polishing cloth? If you like this , then you don&#39;t have any idea that  where samsung tab S9 ultra takes you too and enable you to what extent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=855\">14:15</a> Did you forget you can use your phone as a hotspot? True a cell can be a hotspot. My provider throttles the hotspot speed. Then I need to make sure that I enable the hotspot whenever I want to use my iPad. Or, I can just get 5G goodness on the iPad so that I can open it and use it at any time without having to do anything else. It is a different experience. @@martyscholes119 I didn’t say it wasn’t a completely different experience. But in my opinion, they’re not different enough to justify paying for another data plan. Once they integrate the ability to side load apps then I&#39;ll consider it. you dont have time to use ipad. no point in buying I buy it to read my manga😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=268\">4:28</a> this is just not true...iPads are terrible when it comes to multitasking. Tab s9 feels the same for me, here samsung sells it with the keyboard cover at the box, and is a wonderful kit. Much more cheap than apple, but high quality. OLED display, ip68, portable, high resolution pen, and now a lot of good apps. Yep. I couldn&#39;t see anything mentioned that my S9 tablet can&#39;t already do.🤷\\u200d♀️ exactly and its literally just as thin so I never got the crazy apple hype on that Yup, watching this on my s9 ultra looking at the pen like &quot;y&#39;all didn&#39;t have a button??&quot; S9 is better \\u200b@@FlyingSaucerD Apple users often have no idea that their technology is way behind other brands.🙄😂 @@GeeEee75ah yes, missing a button = behind in technology. \\u200b@aoming6398  If you knew what the functions of that button were, you wouldn&#39;t be confused. You must be an Apple user, because they don&#39;t know about any technology that isn&#39;t in their Apple devices. @@GeeEee75 so what if I’m an Apple user? I like their products. I’m just saying that missing a button doesn’t make them behind in technology completely. @@aoming6398 Ha ha, yeah, you keep using those Apple products, living in happy ignorance. @@GeeEee75 yeah, i’ll keep using them and i’ll keep being “ignorant”. One button missing isn’t going to make me reconsider.<br><br>I’ll be an iSheep for as long as i like their products😄 Didn&#39;t you say you loved your writing pad because it did only one thing and minimises distractions? Why would you want to replace that with an iPad? I stick to my Samsung Galaxy Tablet.<br>It&#39;s 5️⃣ X cheaper! What about a Macbook Pro with a touchscreen? for what i use my laptop for, i can do it all on my Samsung tablet. the magic keyboard (despite it being pretty expensive) would basically be all i would ever need. But using the apple pencil to turn it into a note taking device and pretty interesting. also multitasking on tablets is a great experience imo. I mainly use my tablet and laptop for media consumption and emails/light word processing. The pro would be WAY over kill for me but maybe the air or even the base ipad (especially at the new price) would fit my needs better. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=476\">7:56</a> lol There are a lot of reviews of the new iPads already posted.  Yours sticks out for your presentation which is top notch.  Super informative and well edited and clearly on a quick turnaround.  Nicely done. The e-ink unit will not disturb you while you work with notifications and social media. Seriously. Who in the right mind buys this over a beast pc. You could even buy a motorcycle with that money. 500 bucks is the limit for an iPad imo… I&#39;m not going to spend that much on an iPad. N e v e r. As an artist and architect I have to say a tablet goes a long ways in work processes. It’s definitely becoming a niche product for professionals. 400k until you catch up to apple.... Just get a surface pro instead, it is such a good tablet, many people forget to compare it to other tablets, and it ends up being compared to laptops more often than tablets. I feel like you could have done this video 3 years ago... Not much new here and really not worth the high end price for the 1 and 2 GB models. You can use Sidecar with a Macbook and 13 inch iPad Air. That way you have a slick 2 screen setup on the go, a real laptop, and the touch screen and pen features for creative work on the iPad when you need it. Plus you could buy both a Macbook Pro and a 13 inch iPad Air for the same $3600 price tag. He will ship it to me 😊, thank you @mrwhosetheboss iPadOS is soooo much worse then macOS Whats the song at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=350\">5:50</a>? I just cannot believe somebody would actually pay $3,600 for an ipad. <br>Now I understand why Warren Buffett sold Apple. <br>This company will be losing business 14 inch tablet is better.  I accidentally warmed up with Samsung and I sold all my Apple stuff it is literally better tablet my iPad pro 12.9 because you&#39;re loaded? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Because you are rich 🤷 The idea to just only using mobile OS is not for me. Coding for example is not easy on ipad iPads has been great for Art so thats my angle, they also do great in comparisons stacked-up against Wacom/Huion in this space and can offer more being a standalone. Not a fan of them starting off so expensive for the Pro models but its Apple right? they have made a lot of good changes to iPad Os to allow for less constraints but there is always room for more freedom/support here. Good thing there is not a MacBook 360 or this ipad would NOT sell. Unfortunately pad OS is bottlenecking the ipad so tragicly $3600 dollars for a tablet!? I could&#39;ve bought a PC which probably would have been much more worth it 😭 nice background music I sheep 4 times the average salary in slovakia and still no calculator :) in Canada it is almost 4k Youtube machine Ipad OS ruins the experience. Our 5 year old tab s4 has more software features. Dex is one of the favorites. <br><br>The thickness is very impressive on the pro! <b>People don&#39;t understand that the prices of things are never going back down. This inflation is deeper than we think. Those buying groceries are well aware that the real inflation is much over 10%. The increments don&#39;t match our income, yet certain invstors still earn over $365,000 in stocks and assets. Wish I could accomplish that</b> I have an ipad pro 6th gen, M2. I never use it. The only time I use it is when I feel bad for not using it. Or, when I use it for my survey work but that is to make my job easier and rare. Other than that it hardly gets used. It is already pretty thin. Im not sure it needs to be any thinner. <br>Personally if it is just a screen and faster chip then I wouldnt bother unless you want the fastest netflix device. Instagram doesnt even work properly, the app is shrunk down into a rectangle. The battery is terrrrrible as well. As I am getting further into the video......is this the first time in a while Arun has used an ipad pro. It is the same as the previous versions. Crapple is Garbage 🗑️ Apple: Spend in R&amp;D to catch up with the competition❌ Spend money to make thin products✅ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=239\">3:59</a> you will. $3600 is daylight robbery. Overcharging for devices has always been Apple&#39;s strategy but gotta wonder where they want to be with almost 165 billion in cash and over a trillion dollar in stocks. Greed and concentration of money. There’s nauseating materialism… and then there’s MrWhoseTheBoss nauseating materialism! Wait till you open the Instagram app Now your brainrot ads can load faster Bruh you have unlimited money just buy the damn ipad 💀 5.8K I just purchased one on PayPal credit, I have 4 months to pay 😢 Tablets need PC/Laptop OS, not a Phone OS. Then we can talk. It&#39;s so expensive, you can buy the most expensive gaming PC and still have enough to buy the rest that you need like monitor, mouse, keyboard etc. For the price, it&#39;s just pointless unless you ABSOLUTELY need it for like that 1 or 2 apps. But if you need to other accessories, then buy a mac. If they made a Mac with an Apple Pencil, the iPad will just vanish. To answer the clickbait…My guess, you have the money and needed some good content? (Could be wrong) Apple takes a dump on their consumers every year and their loyalists eat it up every time. Samsung wins the tablet market just for allowing their tablets to become PCs using DEX. Thinner and more powerful, definitely priorities. And of course make it more expensive, just what we need in this day and age. As an Apple fan I feel they’re out of touch with reality and what most people want. Wouldn’t be surprised if down the line cheaper competitors keep taking more and more of their market share. What is even the point in owning an iPod nano 7th gen in 2024 when it&#39;s no longer Apple&#39;s thinnest device?! 😉😛 3600... really? Apple treating its consumers: 🤡 Why is this guy always flexing over how much money he can spend? I’ve only seen a few videos, but all are like that. Not digging it, going to watch another channel for a review that is insightful instead of watching an inflated ego. It’s bullshit how much these cost I don’t care how good it is, it’s over priced as hell. Bro got sponsored from apple !???🍎 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=121\">2:01</a> why using remarkable when you can write on S24 ultra Yeah i would have gone an asus g14 with a 4070 instead It’s not $3,600<br>I just bought one with all the options maxed, with AppleCare, keyboard, and Pen and it came to $3,246.00 Pause Ipad pro for sure seems like an expensive toy. Even my ipad pro gen 2 seems way overpowered for what ipad OS can do. The new screen is nice sounding, but Ipad OS needs a lot of work before i care at all about improvements in compute power. I do love my ipad pro gen 2, but i am searching for a reason to want to upgrade. I use my iPad every day, all day but I must admit. It&#39;s not the tech that lets it down. It&#39;s iOS. It just isn&#39;t up to the capability of OSX. This is made particularly apparent when using programs such as Keynote which are dumbed down almost unusable compared to the OSX version. Even simple things like dragging attachments from one email to another can be a nightmare. On the plus side, my iPad has never crashed or overheated so there&#39;s that but iOS leaves a ton to be desired. Because you&#39;ll make more than the cost by simply making a video about it? And you can write it off as a work expense? I could think of a couple different reasons why you bought it. XD All we&#39;ve asked for is a decent ipad mini that gets updated... 2k or a bare minimum 1080p upscaled 120 hz <b>atleast</b> oled screen (no liquid retina or w.e apple calls them), an overclocked processor that is better than or rivals samsung, some amenities from the higher end lineups i.e centered-camera/productivity seamless ecosystem features ect, an apple pencil support that should work just as well as it does on the ipad pro with the edition of pro apps you&#39;d find on the pro as well (alot of people get apple products for the pro/apps and the mini is one of apple&#39;s best selling products so what are we doing here?) + the newer hardware-based ray tracing *self explanatory\\xa0<br><br><br>And for the love of God can we get a better multitasking/customization &amp; a pc like desktop mode considering the chipset and ram is enough Bro you literally are turning into an apple shill. It runs ipadOS and everyone knows many MANY programs do not work on it and you know this lol. The OS holds it back so much (even though the hardware is pretty fire) so to replace your macbook pro? Please stop Let’s see your review two months after using it instead of your Mac? It still runs iPadOS..... happy birthday to me 8/5/2024 big redesign huh? meanwhile everyone else: &quot;its still an ipad&quot; Bro just called me broke in 1,000 ways U were going deep with that smart tooth brush haha 😂 When will Arun create the phone that will be better than the iPhone i mean you could just buy a 13 macbook air. after buying all the accessories and keyboard and shiz its such a rip. 😂 this is the funniest justification of spending a ridiculous amount of money on something he doesnt need even a little bit.  Great youtuber but 6 months from now he will be thinking wtf was i thinking. It is a really light paperweight most days. Should I buy this as an first &quot;mac&quot;? Man called me broke in 40 different ways 💀 dont feel bad, even people who could afford them, wouldn&#39;t buy it because it&#39;s financially irresponsible to do such a stupid overpriced purchase arun did you change the title of the video I hate that everything needs an app and an account.  I much preferred a browser based world. the ipads will never be a laptop replacement, macbooks are just more versatile, you have macOS, which supports third party apps, more support for apps and more control with the help of your keyboard, unless ipads get MacOS support, i believe that it will never be a full on replacement. Yeah..all that is not worth the money. Another overpriced tech that doesnt bring much new to the table...usual Apple thing 8k cocomellon lol Aruunnnnnnnn! <br>Please don&#39;t use ads at the starting of video! <br>I like your videos a lot but there&#39;s one problem! <br>Every video is filled with ads! It&#39;s necessary but add  both the ads after the video starts! <br>The moment I click on the video ads pop up! Unskippable 30 sec ads! <br>I just restarted this video 5 times just to stop an ad! Buy YT premium like everyone else. Doesn’t your cable on tv has commercials?? @@astrostoyspace nope i don&#39;t use cable!  Never had one.  I&#39;m not bothered by ads in between videos, I&#39;m just annoyed by starting a video with an ad! <br>And you can buy it for me if you&#39;re really bothered by whatever I commented because I&#39;m not going to pay for something I do to just kill time. @@ashiitothao5878 well most people I know YouTube has to see ads at the start of videos. The hinge for the case is definitely an annoyance, as well as not adding a holder for the pencil…. Waiting for the bend test from JerryRigEverything... Bro has to buy an trampolin castle full of polsters so it dosen&#39;t imidieatly break cant lie ps remote play is fantastic on ipad when travelling Arun. Explain yourself. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=41\">0:41</a> Over priced products You know if no one bought that bish in the first 2 weeks of it coming out they would drop the price. Thats how much power we have if we just come together. This thing isn’t worth that price and they know it. But they also know that we are dumb and will just give them our money for the same thing every year lol. The title should have been &quot;I spent 3600$ on the iPad Pro M4 so you don&#39;t have to&quot; Because I have 18m subscribers, because I can , so I create content on it and not feel a dent in my bank account. That’s why. No hate though good for him 😂 \\u200b@JamieAyling  subscribers mean nothing. views matter more. &#39;Hi, hipeotech here. I wasted 4k on a ipad pro silver balls, no chicklet keyboard edition. Why? so you don&#39;t have to&#39; Well it isnt for the average consumer ouht And sheepol would still buy Well technically he apparently spent $2000  of the $3600 on the Nano Coating 😳 *because it’s a business expense 😂 @@JamieAyling Are you Arun&#39;s girlfriend? Or iPad Pro M4 Commercial @@JamieAylingyou dont have 18m subscribers imagine how fsr we could have developed when its not all about money I hope no one buys this. I am a big time Apple user but this is stupid and too expensive. Here is an idea, sell an M1 iPad 13&quot; for $300. You would still make profit and folks would be set for life with that tablet. My dream of playing cyberpunk on just the iPad alone still isn&#39;t here yet 😮\\u200d💨 Tech for the gullible, finding excuses to waste £3k on a tablet.<br>Surely if it is a pro , you’d expect a keyboard and pen in the box. im on opera gx hallo iPad is much faster to get stolen since it&#39;s huge If only it ran MacOS... until then, hard pass. I have that ipad I switched to an iPad Pro from a MacBook a year ago and wouldn’t go back. I prefer using Apps on the iPad to the Mac and for my job have a windows RDS environment to give me a windows experience .. all in a very portable form factor definitely going to update to M4 soon Somebody tell me 5 things for which people use ipad ? Because you rich?! does this allow airplay with home  pod ? does it have nfc feature ? @samcerulean1412<br>0 seconds ago<br>That was a whole lot of justifying. I feel like no one really competes with Apple on the technology they provide. The engineering level is unmatched which I think is a shame.<br><br>Almost all of their products feel like they need to be justified on price. Wish previous apple pencil had ‘find my’ i have not been able to find it for months. It could be in my car, or underneath my bed, sofa. Waste of money <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=250\">4:10</a> one thing that I really like this keyboard is that you can pick it up with the iPad with one hand and it stays in position. Most other keyboards for tablets such as the Microsoft surface aren’t the same and you have you lift it with 2  hands and it just feels a lot more flimsy. The battery life sucksss, try playing a game and streaming it, your battery will go down even while plugged in. not having 120hz display on ipad air is disappointing . I can’t wait to watch jerryrigeverything punishing this new iPad to see how more bendy than the last iPads is NGL this is just another useless apple product because you’re rich and this video will make you richer Glad to see such a large tech YouTuber talking about what iPad Pro fans have been talking about since the M1. They still are not complete replacements for full pc’s. There are definitely several use cases that do not work on iPad, but for people that don’t need those use cases, like myself, the iPads are everything you need and then some. Honestly, in september, you should buy the iPhone 16. Copium brother im sorry it would be cool if the vibration motor would make the pen act like a real one and feed in light vibration to emulate the way a pen feels on paper😂 I wonder if the 2D battery will have a soft update to 3D like a puffer fish when subject to stress... Because that’s what it costs No Mac OS means lack real softwares for these M4 iPad Pro. Useless It hasn&#39;t even been a day lol Many of the things you missed were already on Windows laptops. Like the simcard. in short, not worth it literally just look at their pricing for the storage and it&#39;s obvious, $200 for $22 worth of storage (guarantee its even cheaper for them to produce). &quot;i was so surprised how similar it was to a mac&quot; yet more expensive, less power, and without the same versions of the &quot;pro&quot; apps. you could spec out the best laptop/pc possible for the same price. More overpriced trash Apple just went too far with the price Softwarewise. Ipad still not even close to a Mac...unfortunately.<br>And the old pen has a button. You can type 2 timer on the bottom side. Because you got $$$$ They should put handles on these like steam decks at this point 😂 yada yada tl;dr<br><br>the question is: can you bend it? can you do a review on brand new fax machines please? I&#39;m worried when my 20 year old machine fails i won&#39;t be able to get a new one Everyday I&#39;m throttling... din din din din ding din - ding di ding din din ding din I look forward to your follow up video titled “Turns out the IPad is not a replacement for my laptop” This functions are what samsung had years back, iphone always make it seem like its new and big deal🤣🤣🤣 anyone else thinks background on it is ugly? I love my iPad Pro. I won’t be upgrading for years, but I wouldn’t be without one for sure. I suffer severe migraines… a heavy laptop is too heavy to take to bed with me, the phone is not big enough for movies, and so the iPad just suits me so much. I can lay whatever position I need to, and still have a decent screen with decent sound. I also love using Procreate on it as I’m ordinarily a pencil artist, but my migraines can often prevent me from sitting up to draw on paper. Same here. I have my first and only ipad, the M1 ipad pro and I’ll never upgrade it in my life, I’ll keep using it as long as it works. Just like ipad serves almost all my daily functions and requirements, at the same time I don’t feel any need to change or upgrade it in future. So I think that it was a well made investment and just hope it functions the way it does for many more years to come. Mr. WTB: &quot;Smart toothbrush.&quot;<br>Editor: 😈 I have a clip for that. cause im a tech YouTuber I don&#39;t care about your wedding/new home/business - just tell me about the tech i use a tablet for university and it is very good for it, i&#39;m learning to be a pharmacist, so i learn a lot of chemistry and using the tablets pencil is essential, but i can use my keyboard when i have to write longer I do in fact dislike using &quot;the app&quot; of a service. I want as few apps on my devices as possible. TLDR he spent $3k because it&#39;s a shiny new toy. Doesn&#39;t do anything better than a PC, laptop or phone for what their advantages are, it&#39;s just neat to play around with. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but doesn&#39;t the M1 iPad already do the vast majority of what Arun is talking about? I have one and I can&#39;t see a ton of extra benefits aside from faster speed, and I never max the M1 out on iPad. Samsung tab s9 ultra&gt;&gt; better price for amazing product Not worth it at all <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=532\">8:52</a> Mobile apps are the future for most people esp kids now will be more familiar with mobile than PC or laptop.<br><br>Apple just needs to fix their file management in iPad OS without having an opening for piracy. And most if not all capabilities of Mac OS but for touch 4+ minutes in.. nothing your dedication to your craft is really inspiring! i remember thid having 27 comments all that power and its STILL JUST an ipad! we need a proper OS and then this woud actually be a game changer Why Apple cannot port Mac Os on ipad is a mystery. Two in one, with keyboard is in mac os, once detached it turns in ipad os... It makes the vision pro look affordable The new iPad is the cost of the Vision Pro, think about that, you get much more value with the Vision Pro. Yes, my man 😍 I aint spending literally thousands of dollars for a overpriced tray holder. The price for this is ridiculous. I bet sales for that m4 tablet is gonna disappoint Apple. Get a xioami pad 6 or pad 6 pro bro 😅   with hyper os they are the best for the price to value ratio I am currently watching this on an iPad gen 10 Jerryrigeverythign is gonna have fun bending this with 2 fingers!!!! I like trains 🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃 Your in for a very bad surprise😢 Why brother I’m about to buy too. Sorry that price is just being stupid for a tablet come onnn this is triple the price of my computer I purchased it too.  But I’m not happy that they haven’t included a macOS option when connected to the ipad magic keyboard.  Maybe WWDC? Things that he will notice upon buying it<br><br>It is a powerful device powered by a silly os, not simple.<br><br>IPhone apps don&#39;t work on iPad,  they can&#39;t scale on their own Writing with your hands is very niche idea to me. Keyboards are way faster, and macbooks have more capability in terms of functionality. Its not a professional machine, you still can&#39;t use desktop apps (which is the purpose of CPU strength in pcs), can&#39;t code, can&#39;t download outside App Store, and a keyboard is 350 dollars.. Not buying a macbook instead is just so pointless. Is there a way to have direct physical connection to ethernet with one of these?  Or can you only use wifi? A tablet can never replace a laptop. If you just want to type notes, watch videos, use social media. It&#39;s ok to buy a tablet. But when you want lots of resources, CPU, RAM, upgrade RAM... Van to cold up the CPU, a tablet is not the one to buy. I have apple watch o and a iPad Pro 2020 and a iPhone 12 mini and a make book 2020 and they all work great I use them all for different things like my Mack I use for photo shop and illustrator and video editing as it&#39;s better and quicker on a make but editing photo I do on my iPad and taking photos and messaging I do on my phone and gaming I do on my phone and iPad and my watch I use to track my steps and sleep and use \\uf8ff pay on it to I just think app le do thing other companies do but a year or more later then them but they release it later to make it better apple products are the best product ever Almost there to catch up with MKBHD in terms of subscribers 🍏 🐑🐑🐑 As long as these run iPadOS (just iOS in disguise) I ain&#39;t getting near that thing As someone who wants to switch over to an iPad for the thinness and streamlined apps (I don’t do anything power intensive), I was interested in getting the 13”. Then I saw the prices. At that price point just get a MacBook. Chanel is getting boring now ,he should go back to the basics Tablets are worthless (for me) bro, a laptop is already a filthy casual <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> caught me off gaurd tho 😂 How is &quot;thin&quot; even a selling point anymore. Its not 2015. Tech influencers trying to convince you that “this new ipad is different” I&#39;d rather get a gaming computer.  Honestly, everything Apple is overpriced. Cause it’s your job and for<br>Clicks… Gotta pay the bills somehow, 😂. 3600 dollars either buy a stupidly fast and wasted energy on an iPad or on a stupidly heavy smart scuba gear so basically it&#39;s a laptop with a detachable monitor that becomes a touch screen. Your review makes me the 2024 iPad feel like it is a brand new product and the M1&amp;M2/ older iPads didn’t exist before.<br><br>Also all the accessories people bought can’t work with the 2024 iPad. Remember sitting on a tablet and having it broken screen afterwards? When you sit on this laptop it will probably evaporate. xD 1. Because you have shitload of disposable money?<br>2. Because you gonna earn back on the views and marketing?<br>3. Because you are apple fanboy?<br>4. Out of sheer curiosity to see how it fares short and long term. Mostly because it will bring you enough views Made the same decision you did for similar reasons.  Will be selling my MBP 14 and old iPad Pro. a god gaming pc is 2000 how is a iPad $3600 ? Waste of money The iPad pro is certainly amazing however Apple themselves will tell you that their “pro” devices (iPad Pro, Macbook Pro and Mac Pro) aren’t meant for everyone.<br><br>Most can get away with the lower end devices like the Air (iPad and Macbook) or iMac/Mac Mini… <br><br>One thing I’ve noticed a lot with technology is that people are really sold on the marketing specifically that of Potential… If only someone could magic a way to load MacOS onto the iPad..... Bc you&#39;re rich and this is a fun purchase looks like this will run mac os and ios.. i still use iphone 6 from 2014, hasn&#39;t bent So....a macbook, keyboard sold separately. Are they really making the M4s debut in an iPad? The most Apple thing to do with this new release is making the existing product lines incompatible... The new Pencil looks great, but won&#39;t work with the 6th Gen Pro, and the Magic Keyboard finally having that function key row - But not working with any of the previous models... It&#39;s quite frustrating, but very typically Apple. I&#39;ll keep using their stuff though; it lasts a long time and is powerful (cries in wanting new stuff because it&#39;s new) Mrwhosetheboss spent lots of hours just to let us know about the iPad pro. Just look at his windows. Amazing For the first time the video felt a little biased towards apple, I mean a very small (can&#39;t stress this point enough) a really really small amount of people carry a laptop alongside a pad that feels like paper but isn&#39;t. The new ipad seems a great product for digital artists or people working around similar professions. The airtag is thinner and definately constitutes a device. Yeah no. Look I am buying a 12 inch one to replace my 2018 iPad Pro but 3600 on this thing is absolutely brain dead. I had a apple pencil<br>(i have no clue where it is now, i lst it somewhere) Honestly, this is robbery at this point You almost have ME convinced and I still use my Samsung Galaxy Tab A from like 2015 precisely BECAUSE of price.  I am eagerly looking forward to the in-depth follow up review! Do what I did. I replaced my Samsung tablet with a second hand iPad Air 4th gen that I found in perfect condition for 270 usd on eBay. I am loving this thing, it flies and just makes my previous Samsung S7 (which is two years newer) feel like a dinosaur. As someone who entire dumped the MacBook line once the iPad Pro and magic keyboard was released… this was the future I saw early and jumped on and have not regretted it once. Welcome to the club Yet you still need Mac or windows to download certain things. I&#39;m exactly on the opposite side. Bought an iPad Pro a couple of years ago and sold it 5 months later. I already have a smartphone AND a laptop AND a Mac Mini. 0 need for an iPad. I&#39;d only switch if they add MacOS, but I doubt it&#39;s ever going to happen. You are gonna be very disappointed thinking this will replace your Mac.  It is terrible to actually do productive stuff with.  Great for Youtube and Netflix.  Not great for much else Nothing about that ipad is a &#39;redesign&#39;! Nothing In 6 months: &quot;Why I am returning my IPad Pro&quot; You don&#39;t really need it, nobody &quot;needs&quot; it, and you certainly don&#39;t need the top spec maxed out version, but It&#39;s around one day of income for you. It&#39;s the equivalent of a regular person paying £150 for something. Having used an iPad for the last three years, I can assure you that I will never buy an apple tablet again. This whole video is you convincing yourself to push the buy button - I have this exact same conversation with  friends and family before I buy a tech toy I don&#39;t need - but &quot;totally need&quot;  :P   Love your videos So this is basically a video of Arun trying to decide whether he should buy the new ipad pro or not🤦🏻\\u200d♂️ Because it&#39;s a tax write off. Please do video about samsung a55 Pls  mi aipad mini pliiis me imim I&#39;m wondering, how much apple pays for this advert? Worlds most powerful Youtube and Netflix machine Damn, I could have used that $3600 better lol Just because because the cost price of entry into ipad pros is higher doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s overpriced. <br>They are 10x better than Android tablet trash such as the galaxy tabs who try to charge the same prices without even being half as good.  <br>Apple is giving TWO OLED panel display and M4 without even raising the starting price had it been gimmicky Android guys they would overcharge the heck out of it. <br>Take the galaxy fold for example. wait untill they drop the m4 comp He is evil. god no! if an app directs me to an app instead of a website that&#39;s the quickest way to get me to return it. that means it has tons of features locked down that should be part of it and it won&#39;t let you make it work with other things which it should be able to<br><br>not to mention it also means they&#39;re going to charge you more after the facts because they still have control over your device and how you use it instead of you. Buy samsung s9 ultra and compare them please iPad screen ratio is not design for watching video and iPad doesn&#39;t have full MS suite features. MacBook has both advantages <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=236\">3:56</a> I&#39;ll take it off your hands if you don&#39;t need it my guy As an Android user (Samsung / Motorola) what killed the tablets for me was the desktop modes (DeX / Moto Connect) in the flagship lines (S / Edge). I use it daily since 2019. The smartphones become Chromebooks! You just lost a bunch of credibility with this video… how much did Apple pay you for this?? I mean I guess if you don’t work on your own videos anymore, but just because they have an iPad Final Cut I still don’t think it can replace my Mac. And i know that you don’t genuinely think so either. Bro what, kids will still make it look like they found it in the toilet Imagine spending $3600 just to watch skibbidi toilet What game is that though? That&#39;s a lot of money for Peyton to spend on babysitting devices for Skylar, Anhalo, and Thaddeus. i couldnt handle those smudges and that big touch screen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=67\">1:07</a> Poor vision. Best reason for an iPad. With a decent back I bet it will feel more substantial. BTW, ever visit an Apple facility? Way more people of color in their advertising. who noticed him using his smart toothbrush Looks like a bit of a stumble to me. I&#39;m sorry, how much?? I guess I&#39;m not the only one who is tired about the TABLET - LAPTOP &quot;conspiracy&quot;? why can&#39;t I touch stuff on my MacBooks screen? what happened to those amazing touchscreen laptops from back in the day, they are just forcing us to buy 2 different devices when what we all need is a tablet like the new iPad m4 but able to handle all the software that comes for the laptop world. <br><br>In that specific case I wouldn&#39;t feel robbed when getting the expensive keyboard or an expensive pen, right?<br><br>Too conservative, they could do it. <br>I know all they care is revenew but are they doing the math right? Ya, something so slim And you know you&#39;re going to put a case on it...<br>Makes it kinda pointless Limited to one user.   ..  ugh Xiaomi pad 6? I have no interest in this product and still watched it, great work Don&#39;t switch jet, wait for the next generation. Arun when are u getting married &quot;the one thing that i really struggle to wrasp is tablets [...] i take this remarkable writing tablet with me, almost, wherever i go&quot; ...because you have the money? I almost bought the Galaxy tab S9 to figure it out the S10 date will be announced in the summer. I&#39;ll wait but I don&#39;t want to spend a lot of money for unnecessary extra&#39;s the tablet will be with. Idk what will be but I have my hopes up. Also waiting for accessories for that tablet will be long. The wallpaper they use when advertising the new iPads looks like abstract Dynamic Islands. So... for 3 times the cost of a superior galaxy tablet that does more, better quality, and doesnt insist upon itself, you can get the ipads answer to that, and then spend more to get the inferior pen? So the iPad air is pointless @DIYPerks they(apple) stole your double OLED idea sue them 😂 I agree on every point, but: Can I run my own code? On pc it&#39;s easier to pirate stuff. So if I&#39;m going the legal route I get lesser of a service because I ohmygaaaawd maybemaybe PiRaTe StUfF. I rather pirate and get unrestricted access whenever wherever I still own a 2016 iPad, and just pulled the trigger on the 11in. These tablets last long, and will stay with you a long time. i still have a 2013 ipad The iPad Pro could basically be a Macbook replacement, if using multiple apps simultaneously was implemented better. Whether you&#39;re talking about slide-over, split screen or stage manager, iPadOS still has some problems with which app is &#39;active&#39;. When watching a video and taking notes at the same time it still happens way too often that the keyboard refuses to type into the notes app, but types into the browser instead. Stuff like that make it sometimes completely unusable. If they fixed that, it&#39;d be damn near perfect.<br><br>Selecting text is also quite fussy, even with a trackpad. It&#39;s just less precise than on a Mac somehow. They over designed it with fancy animations and it just doesn&#39;t feel good.<br><br>But it&#39;s really close. Much closer than most tech reviewers seem to suggest. The OS is really nearly identical to MacOS nowadays really - when using Stage Manager in particular, iPad is basically the same as Mac. Except for those active window bugs.<br><br>It&#39;s mostly some power-user apps that are missing. But then again, you do get a lot of very polished apps back in return. Imagine spending a pc worth of money on a tablet just to find a kid watching yt kids on it can i have one? jk Because you have money 😜 Don’t buy. Just go to the next food bank! Apple kinda falling off. Interested to see the sales of this. Vision pro v2? Yoo I am still confused... Should I go for iOS or Android??? Why would you ever do that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=576\">9:36</a> bro has become the filthy casual and doesn&#39;t even realise it 💀 Very heavy laptop? :D Why I say I spent $3600 instead of £ when I live in the UK <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=920\">15:20</a> hopefully with apps sideloading coming to iOS we can finally get BitTorrent systems so we can do backups and have our own personal icloud. 🏆 you spend that money to make more money, not because its a great tool. Wtf its just other stuff to waste life away for 3600 bucks. If you can shit money its for you. bro help me with a laptop, i want to learn web development still better than spending $3,500 on the vision pro God, I love watching Apple people try to justify Apple products. i love ipads but WHY would u spend $3600 on one when u can get an M3 max MacBook Pro that has like 4-5x the power Watching this on my BRAND NEW Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra! Price: $1619.99 watched the Apple iPad event on my Samsung Galaxy smart Monitor 43&quot; Price: $599.99 WATCHING APPLE EVENTS ON MY SAMSUNG GALAXY DEVICES Price: PRICELESS!!!😅😂😅😂 i feel sorry for samsung the father of tablet&#39;s with a free Smart pen and oled since 2014 yet they never get any praise. Is this video sponsored by apple? Only issue with the ipad is that you cant use it to do what a computer can do, which defeats the whole purpose of the thing. Just put a video editing software on it and allow it to be able to code and you would have the most amazing machine, alas one that would also compete with apple&#39;s own other lineup namely the macbooks, so they dont do it. I would never be able to replace my Macbook with an Ipad until  the day the full iOS gets on the pad, till then the computer is worth the heft. This is the start of the title &quot;Macbook Killer&quot; ¡Erria! just following samsung ways , some apps will work better on the tablets , but &quot;processor contracts&quot; prevents them to use better CPUs/GPU.      ps: Tandem OLED exists since 2014 its nothing new , but a very expensive way of putting more brightness per pixel , mantaining temperature and efficiency. Because you have too much money to spend to create YT videos. :D I really dont know why its such a shock. There are apps now that take advantage of the ipad pro. I have the second gen of it. I use Procreate, Adobe Illustrator and Nomad 3D. And honestly Im on it more than i am my desktop. Its super powerful, productive, and portable. I dont know when i would need an M4 processor. Not once has it choked or bogged down. So although its exciting, I dont need it yet. Which is nice to know! Desktops get bogged down much quicker. Oh and I make choice not to use it for entertainment. Its a workhorse. First world problems This video theme is fire 🔥🔥🔥 The feel of an iPad with the keyboard and track pad does often feel like a Mac. But after a short time of using iPadOS, I still find myself rushing back to my Macbook. iPadOS is still the major drawback. You can get a fully kitted out 14&quot; MacBook Pro for $700 less ! PLEASE HEART THIS Imagine, an iPad as expensive as the most powerful consumer end pc in the world... The amount of effort put into this video is amazing Arun, glad to see your opinion on the new iPad Pro, which I feel everyday how you do about Mac and IPad It’s not the computing power, it is the Software that doesn’t let it become a laptop replacement. And there is no reason for Apple to let this hindrance go away to cannibalise its Macbook sales. As a student, I would not care about 10K multi thread score and fanciest ML capabilities when I can’t even use Excel and Word’s full versions and it is way too expensive and overkill for simple note taking and studying. Simple. I worked as an intern in a skin clinic where we used the iPad Pro 6th gen for basically everything from documenting to taking very sharp before and after pictures. And thinking about wanting that same system for myself when I have my own clinic, and comparing the specs from that iPad to the new one I think I still might go with the 6th gen. The price is cheaper (still more expensive than I would like for an iPad) and specs wise the 6th gen would benefit me more. Perhaps if the battery life is increased with the new one I might contemplate getting the new one but for now I&#39;m still going for the 6th gen. Also why is there one microphone less on the new one? And removing the ultra wide lens what is that about?? ill enjoy my galaxy tab s9 ultra Is it me,but it seems like he just found out that you can get an iPad that uses a SIM card? I wonder if he knows you can also buy laptops use a SIM card too? Chrome books, android tablets etc Absolute Waste of Money. They could just have attached the screen to MacBook and make it detachable wtf. It blows my mind that people fall for dumb products that look amazing... This guy is just an advert nowadays Apple just trapping people in their pathetic ecosystem looting money And the question left unanswered... ;) Bro image buying a a pencil when the slogan is bring new pencil experiance like bro what does that mean The iPad isn’t worth it IMO. The UI is not good enough. I saw Samsung ad on this video. Sorry, but still, it&#39;s no full Notebook like experience. It&#39;s just Ipad OS.. I bought an iPad Pro 3 years ago when my mac laptop died and I use it daily. There are some things I like about it, but many things that require me to use my Mac Mini via Jump/VNC. It is 2024 and we still don&#39;t have XCode for IPad. Fingers crossed the next update to iPadOS significantly improves things. it&#39;s a touch screen laptop.... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=1075\">17:55</a> I use 128 GB on my PC 🥲 I feel that students thrive from iPad the most, especially base model iPad, it’s just so easy to write notes on, Mac  would be best for college and work in my opinion anyway if you’re worried about BendGate 2.0, just make sure you don’t carry your iPad around in your back pocket. Should be fine. I mean this isn&#39;t a good look lol I want it To answer the title of the video: Because you can. 🤷\\u200d♂️ I just bought the iPad Pro 6th generation AND NOW THIS COMES OUT LIKE BRO WHAT WHY RIGHT AFTER. At least now you can write it off as a business expense... lol a 13 inch tablet for the price of a really good gaming pc. Good luck with that one. For half the price you could buy a mid range laptop with a GPU instead. The fact this is more expensive than the vision pro is absolutely mental <br>And it pains me to know that it&#39;s only being used to watch Skibidi toilet on youtube It’s only the maxed out specifications of the iPad Pro only when it’s maxed out it cost as much as a Vision Pro Your channel is much better than MKHBD I added every bell and whislte and could not get to the $3,600 figure. But why would you need to add all those things to watch YouTube videos on your iPad? This is... no.. please no.. dont swap your laptop for tablets.. The amount of programs you can no longer download, the amount of games you can no longer play, how can you possibly sit there and say app games are better? The hell. Even using mac instead of Windows is criminal for a tech guy. Why you spent? Because you&#39;re a multi-millionaire and $3,600 to you is the equivalent of most of us finding a quarter in the couch cushions. I use an iPad air 2 and it&#39;s indispensable. ipad os is very underrated. if you have an ipad leave social media, youtube behind for a while, find something else to do with it and you&#39;ll start to see the value. I have fixed it twice already and with it helping me with work, it&#39;s also paid itself off. I have my eyes set on one of the older iPad pros with the home button on it, they&#39;re still good and they still run ios 17 Nothing screams rich or stupid like a 3600 dollar iPad Let&#39;s be honest, he just wanted a touchscreen MacBook. So ......i dont need a laptop anymore ?.......woooow Answer of title: because I dumb 😂😂 Because you make $20k from every video you release. Thats why. Watching it like I can afford it 🤡 I just want a new iPad mini with at least M1 chip. Don’t really need a big iPad might as well carry my MacBook instead. Also iPad Pro with new keyboard and pen cost way too much and there is no need for a iPad Air lol honestly tablets should be under 300 dollars. If i get 10k likes Arun will buy me the same ipad. The iPad is a device that would be great to use if it was a 2 in 1 laptop. The iPad has only one non thunderbolt USB-c port and the RAM is too inadequate for development not to mention no way to build apps I am simple, I need ram. Intergrating any apple device in your life makes things more complicated. Sticking to pc, android, and google workspace is way better. Apple is just scamming people all the time. It&#39;s still severely limited by IOS. This is one of the reasons I got a Surface Pro. I wanted the portability of a tablet with a pen that was still a good productivity computer. Since the Surface Pro uses an actual computer OS, I&#39;ve had no issues with it. Granted Windows link with the phone isn&#39;t the best.<br><br>I would find it interesting if he did a long-term review of a Surface Pro vs the new iPad. Would that even be a fair comparison? Until iPads can play audio from two apps at the same time, they are not ready to replace laptops. You would be paying more money for an iPad Pro than for a MacBook Air, for a more powerful processor, but unable to take advantage of that extra power.<br><br>Here&#39;s hoping Apple updates iPad OS soon! No, iPads are not Macbooks. No matter how much apple try to convince us. iPad OS is in diapers compared to MacOS I did not appreciate that toothbrushing b-roll 😬 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=718\">11:58</a> This video now looks like an ad 😹😹 Fr😂 Because you&#39;re rich, that&#39;s why. FileBrowser Pro was a game changer for me with files. No tablet is worth more than 200 As an artist/designer I’m so excited for Art, animation, and 3d design. <br><br>I want the Apple Pencil pro too. It’s sad that it’s not compatible with the M1 iPad Pro…. <br><br>When they mentioned Zbrush I was like no way. I like how your videos have got (I think) more serious and less frenetic over the last year or so. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> AYO 🤨📸 Old pen? &quot;Gone, not compatible&quot;. &quot;Old keyboard? Sorry, 11 vs. 10.9 buy a new one&quot;. The royal scam company is at it again. It&#39;s absolutely mind-blowing the stuff Apple is allowed to get away with. How stupid can people be? Really. &quot;Why I spent $3600 on the iPad Pro M4.&quot; because you got dollars stacked up through your roof? I would never in my life spend this much on a tablet that isn&#39;t even a real pc. Will it run next gen Crysis? Very excited to upgrade my old M1 iPad Pro which I paid almost $2000 for and have only used to watch YouTube and Netflix 😇 And that temporary effort in art on procreate and affinity iPad can never replace a laptop if you can&#39;t run full-fat software and are limited to the App store. Now if Apple lets you do full on development (i.e. gives you full Unix functionality, Terminal, ability to install IDEs, use the file system, install any software from anywhere on the internet...) then it&#39;s a true replacement. I&#39;ll wait for your recap and revisit I’m disappointed they didn’t just make the bezels much thinner if even at all. Would’ve been nice if they did and kept the footprint the same to be compatible with the previous magic keyboards Where is mrwhosetheboss did he move house If you are an editor / a music maker/ a gamer who plays games that have really realistic graphics it’s a good idea. Go to iPad Pro but if you are a person that needs something for school, probably a good idea togo with the iPad Air. if you’re just a casual Joe who doesn’t really need a big iPad but you still want something for Notes go with the iPad mini or if you want you can always get a refurbished iPad. If you didnt watch, heres the summary:<br><br>If you&#39;re rich, and love apple, buy the new ipad The current iPad Pro is already very thin. The difference in thickeness between the last gen and this ipad is 1.3mm.<br>iPad Pro 12.9&quot; - 6.4mm<br>iPad Pro 13&quot;    - 5.1mm Wait! Are we gonna ignore that he mentioned about him getting married? Congrats 👏 Nope. Not hoing to! ‘I’m an 8TB guy’ 😂 Me too. Just can’t afford it. When I think of Jerry rig everything I’m thinking this is up his alley No MacOS for $3,600? Mrwhosetheboss gave spoiler of moving to a new home so new studio tour video is coming soon..... I got a apple ad lol I still feel the S9 Ultra is a way ahead of this... I own an iPad pro gen 3 and it is basically an iPhone experience on steroids but you don&#39;t have the same flexibility as a laptop because you are restricted to apps that are available on ipad, it&#39;s great but you can&#39;t utilise the M4 processor at all Tbh I have a first gen iPad Pro with a logitech folio keyboard case and a gen 1 apple pencil along with a 2018 Mac Pro, and I have tried bluetooth mice with my Ipad when I&#39;m at home (cause the folio case has a keyboard but no trackpad), and when Im at college and tbh the Mac just works all the time, I constantly feel like oooo maybe the iPad will be better since it has a good keyboard (better than my mac cause the 2018 mac has a shit keyboard) and it can draw which can sometimes be useful when copying stuff off the teachers board, but tbh the mac just works better as an all in one. If you need to do work processing it is just better and the cursor because it is designed for touch is just simply less accurate and i constantly find myself using my finger when i have bought my iPad to college instead of my mac which is very annoying when you have clammy hands or you have just eaten. The new iPad Pro looks good but from my experience, nothing beats the simplicity of a Mac, it will always just work and seems to have a much better battery life too. But that is just my experience, I think Apple wants you to think that it could replace your Mac in order to try and get you to buy an iPad Pro but it just simply can&#39;t - they want you to double up on a Mac and iPad but it just isn&#39;t a replacement. Its one of them things which you think would be a good idea but isn&#39;t. Its kinda a decision you have to experience for yourself since I know for some it can be a replacement but even my mate who has an iPad Pro and Mac agrees. Petition for Arun to get the Pura 70 ultra Why do you keep bringing your wedding into the tech videos..? That&#39;s literally $5000 Canadian. 😵\\u200d💫😵\\u200d💫😵\\u200d💫 Oh boy watch when jerryrig get his hands on that 😂 They can keep it. This crap is for entertainment. My S23 Ultra works great for mobile and nothing apple provides out-of-box will handle my workload. this is what a biased yt channel look like Rich folk devices... many people struggle to pay for groceries. Ill start by saying i bought an iPad pro M1 about a couple of years ago and haven’t touched my MacBook pro since. Its an amazing product. Surfing the net, watching YouTube and i dont mind watching Netflix and such on it (actually enjoy it a lot). That being said, i would take a closer look at apps that you plan to use. Im a designer &amp; a photographer and the main programs that you would want, the app versions are not up to par. For example The Photoshop app is a joke! Its useless as a professional tool and infuriating considering the amount of money they want for in their subscription. I looked long and hard to try to find a good alternative and found one (affinity photo. What PS should be on ipad) but there was a long learning curve… its hard teaching an old dog new tricks😂. I will say lightroom is totally good enough as a professional tool on ipad. My personal opinion is that if the apps were full versions as in desktops, i would never touch a laptop again. The ipads are super intuitive and fun. Its $999.....<br>Stop trying to shame apple by choosing their highest specs, which is will end up being around $2399 even with the nano glass and 2TB storage. you spend it because you have the money to buy it or you may get it for free.who else buys a ipad for 3600$ You really seem to have had very low expectations of current tablet technology Would never spend that kind of money on a tablet or even a laptop Answer: you&#39;re an isheep, we all know how much you love apple and all their revolutionary products Hot, but imo bad take. It&#39;s still an iPad, as soon as you actually see the current software limits and experience the throwback compared to the macbook you&#39;ll probably at least miss the mac i was the same when they put an M1 chip in the iPad pro, ultimately, they are never going to make your iPad a laptop or a MacBook. Because it effects their bottom line. The Ipad&#39;s are held back solely by apple themselves. They will always be big phones, or small on the go entrainment devices. Just hoping it’s not another note 7 situation You can fix your storage issue with a nas system. Basically your own cloud. It can&#39;t replace a laptop. I&#39;ll say it again. Wake me up when I can run docker and compile programs on an iPad Pro. Watching this on my iPad I can&#39;t justify upgrade to this device when I can&#39;t fine a reason to use my current iPad pro. Ipad is not for programmers. I love this guy but this sounds like a LOT of copium 🥲 Hi how are you today mines on order too... Try to grasp the Apple Vision Pro ... been using mine for a few weeks now and im still confused. Make a video about ipad, ipad paid for. Sorry but you can use all the words in the world to promote it but for that money only brainwashed apple fanboys will buy it I&#39;ve been wanting to dip my toes back into the apple eco after being in google for ages but one of the big downsides for me in a tablet form is that I use my tablet to read on an app that is android exclusive. MF god scammed I absolutely do not prefer an app when a webpage will suffice. The browser has much better features (PWs, search) and works on a PC or anywhere. I hate downloading millions of apps to get something trivial done <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=340\">5:40</a> I don&#39;t why I laughed so hard. 😂 For 3600 that thing better runs 10 pc games at once on 120 fps and still have manageable battery life without overheating u haven&#39;t used files lol.its terrible n no safe eject still...<br>the is hold it back I have purchased a 13 inch Pro and over the next couple of years I’m sure it will be well worth it with the software changes coming. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> zesty ahh way to brush your teeth WWDC will either make the ipad useful or useless. Same crap.  Stick with a Mac. lol, apple tax is insane. Lumafusion beats Final Cut pro anyday on ipad editing , just saying ;)   lovin my m1 12,9 ipad still &lt;3 just buy a galaxy tab... way better iPad 10 best bang for the buck. Almost 1 1/2 yrs now, still perform great. There is like 29 iPads in that room give them some credit about pairing lol No, it will not replace your laptop..... Hmmm…. $3600 on an iPad Pro with \\uf8ffM4, and then there is the $3499 \\uf8ffVision Pro with \\uf8ffM2+R1, both basically run iPadOS, \\uf8ffVP also runs VisionOS…<br><br>\\uf8ffVision Pro should have shipped with the \\uf8ffM3 chip at the least… 🤷\\u200d♂️<br><br>🤔<br><br>🤔 how is Netflix better on the phone? come on Compare 1 min 10 sek when MrWTB reject tablet idea with 2 min 09 sek (59 sek, not even a whole minute 😂) where he admits to having his monochrome tablet at hand almost at all times 🤣🤣🤣<br>Priceless and just great. <br>Greetings to all. you got paid for this shit.... no way you didn&#39;t shit on it within the first 10 minutes because for some bizarre reason we all pay you to I hate to be a fanboy but every quality in the realm of &quot;laptop replacement&quot; on this New ipad was done better in the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra And still, they just cant make calculator app Anyway it is amazing new toy. Enjoy 🍀🍀🍀 I never understood why people want to swap their well-built laptops for tablets with keyboards. It&#39;s not better. You can get 360 foldable touchscreen ultrabooks for sub-$2,000. It&#39;s like reinventing the wheel. Yeah it is capable enough but what does it do what a Laptop can do? Except or artists, Where do I do complex excel tasks, Where do I run VM to run other stuff like poweBI,  Except for multimedia consumption thats it. It kind of sucks to look at a powerful and beautiful device but it can&#39;t do anything? I will keep my MacBook pro 14 36/1TB  for now,  was thinking of returning for the ipad but it just cant be used enough. When a 1 TB  ipad with only 16gb of ram costs the same as my MacBook and does WAAYYYY LESS. Yeah I also prefer that You can buy a car, high end gaming pc, three 55 inch oled tv.....etc for 3600 dollars. Apple is living in fantasy land with the current economy no body can literally afford their products anymore. 😂 I kinda miss the funny parts of your Videos.. It feels more and more like a documentation not a Youtube Video One thing about the Remarkable is that using it is a distraction-free experience. You&#39;ll lose that with the iPad. Yoooo!!! So I love your videos. But…did Apple pay you to make this video? You are tech king you and Marques but…everything you are wowing over isn’t new. I have the M1 Pro and all of the features you are wowing over have been in place since then. Except for the function keys. And then sure the M4 is super fast but why? There is literally nothing that uses that power. There aren’t even apps that use the potential of my M1 Mac. Try actually editing a video with Final Cut luma fusion or Resolve. It’s horrible. No plugins and you will be frustrated and go back to your Mac. I’m an Apple fanboy but your review of this iPad is almost 4 years out of date. I’m tired of the “it needs to run MacOS” crowd… they just need to keep improving iPadOS and bring over more pro apps. Many good points made in this video.  My M2 Pro is still overkill… the camera placement is actually enough for me to sidegrade (dropping down from 12.9 back to 11, since the screens are the same) - video calls and meetings are an all-day affair for me, so that’s huge.<br><br>Wallet stings for a second… here’s hoping WWDC helps justify it even more I love your vids keep it up Look forward to the follow-up video! Hey Aaron can you please test the Samsung Galaxy tab s9 Ultra? Please and thank you if you do🙂 I&#39;m more of an iPad mini person. For me, that 8.3&quot; thing is the bridge between doing stuff while on the move on my phone and doing actual work on my 13&quot; MBP. People watching this on the ipad pro m4 fully maxed out I would have  preferred a  smaller and faster iPad , over thinner. I guess I will have to wait for iPad mini pro! 😢 I really like the new iPad, but man I must tell you I absolutely love the Shirt you are wearing. (Where can I buy it? lol) I think they just put everything into their iPads cuz they have money and for will. Can people please just stop talking about it Why is there a gun inside of my iPad? AYOOOOO that smart toothbrush scene needed to be edited out haha lawd have mercy I am still using an samsung galaxy tab s6 lite from 2022 and I must say that for me its more than enough . Calling someone apple fanboy is the most npc thing ever Let us keeep it very simple. This is an overhyped device. If you really need an ipad get the air! &#39;I&#39;m an 8TB kind of guy&#39;<br><br>Looks at my 256 GB 🤣 Is it just me or it kinda feels like Arun has gotten a bit serious in his videos.<br>Just a doubt. I already have iPad pro and apple pencil M2 i don’t think i need this one I might sound stupid now, but why can&#39;t I use an iPad as a phone :P? I really want a bigger phone with good battery life. The iPad could be just that. Probably looks stupid when I&#39;m using an iPad to pay for things...well, nothing is perfect :D. But the 10.9 inch iPad or the magic keyboard I see you love that toothbrush 😮 My dad always tells me he wants an ipad pro, but knows nothing of the hardware or software. He just likes the screen size.. lol, absolutely never getting him a pro model just to watch youtube and browse facebook. Hes faired just fine with the standard model from a few years back My guess, iPad revenue will continue to decline yoy. Most families bought many devices already during COVID, with inflation and high price like this iPad, I don&#39;t see massive people coming out to upgrade unnecessary. <br><br>Watching this on Galaxy tab 9 ultra which cost less than $500 when I bought it, works awesome For your storage get Linus from LTT to make you a NAS system. If you drop it , screen replacement will cost 10k So scummy to make a new tablet which looks exactly like the old one, but takes only a new redesigned magic keyboard which looks exactly like the old one, and a new pen etc...apple really maxed out on how to re-release items to sell it again for profit. just waiting for all the breaks due to the thinness of this. waayyy overpriced apple stuff once again. How did the Apple Pencil feel on the nano texture screen compared to the ReMarkable 2? Laptops are for producing. iPads are for consuming. You cannot generate anything useful from an iPad. The fact it doesn&#39;t have file support makes it absolutely useless. Add as many colors, flowers, rainbows as you want but still will never be as useful as a PC until they solve the file system issue <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> Arun, we see what you did there 🧐 No floating- not even tiling windows. It&#39;s still useless and it will not replace a computer. 2800£ iPad 64GB + 400 Keyboard+ 300 Pen 😮 Reading anything is superior on the tablet, but doing work is still great on laptop. I haven&#39;t tried typing a whole paper on tablet lately. I always thought the hybrid with detachable tablet is a great idea  but hasn&#39;t been perfected. I don’t see why apple doesn’t combine the macbook air and ipad pro basically making a lenovo yoga allowing you to fold the keyboard back and adding a touchscreen. I&#39;ll be living vicariously through you, brother, because there is no way in hell that I&#39;m paying $3600 for an iPad normal people should wait and see what new capabilities can be done before they spend that kind ofmoney …to be honest seems like a routine spec bump Hardware is top notch but they need to up the OS. Can you delve deeper into exploring integration in professional settings? we are entering a new era of desktop-hybrid devices.. ipad+keyboard setup is a new imac You can get really decent gaming laptop for that kinda money Not worth it since base 10th gen ipad or ipad air can do the same way cheaper and plus they might as well market it as a macbook air replacement im watching this on a ipad air 3 the real answer:<br>because you are STOOOOBID! guys i own an imac from 2017 which works pretty good but i need a portable device so what should i get between the ipad pro 13 inch and the macbook air 15 inch? considering i own an imac Answering the question: because you have to make this video... 3600 😂😂😂?? this guy is so god damn fake. I did this transition from macbook to iPad in 2020 (iPad Air + Pencil + Magic Keyboard), but came back running for a mac in 2022 because iPadOS sucks so much. Good luck though! To answer the question in the title... It&#39;s because he&#39;s rich and he can. So, we got a foldable iPad now? If I imagine what this money could buy me: a super powerfull number crunching Laptop/Workstation for AI Dev. and Computer Vision I get absolutely dizzy. I have a doubt. As a lot of smartphones these days are performing better than Apple, why can’t Apple put their fastest chips (M2,M4 etc) in their phones to make them the fastest?? Really makes me wonder why they haven’t put macOS on iPad. What&#39;s that saying??? A fool and their money are easily parted. The apple pencil for me is the biggest piss take. Use ya fingers way cheaper.<br><br>Also the Ipad at this point is an outdated overpriced gimmick. I see no point to them at all apart from when people give it to the kids to watch peppa pig on youtube. Also almost £3000 with a pencil and keyboard. The mark ups from what it cost them to make to selling no wonder they make a bazillion quid year on year. Just because it has a powerful chip doesn&#39;t mean it can do everything. It doesn&#39;t even have the same passive heat dissipation system of MacBook because no apps can utilize the SoC at full potential. This thing only allows short bursts of calculation/processing for a short period of time. Also ipas os limits how much background apps it can run at the same time unlike macOS without any limitations. Apps also need to use less memory because only certain types of apps can utilize much at a time.<br><br>It should be like surface 2in1 detachable screen laptop I mean simply a MacBook or Mac pad with full performance but then how could apple sell more devices?<br><br>Hence they&#39;re trying everything to limit it and make a different product line.<br>Want something to write? Get an ipad! Want something to do exclusive processing? Get a MacBook. <br><br>So basically users are most likely to buy both devices.<br><br><br>I am waiting for the snapdragon based 2in1 detachable laptop which can solve this issue once and for all. Maybe Microsoft could&#39;ve done better if not killed android apps support. With that they could&#39;ve provided better touch screen apps, many android apps now work with foldable/tablet UI due to scaling capabilities like a desktop app. There&#39;s also an app window resize features like freeform windows.

So they reinvented a laptop but worse This is such a good insight to knoww Phil would have definitely got it ignoring the cost of Small critique, but maybe the font size on the iPad could have been set higher, because it’s hard to read a lot of what’s on the screen (intro). I can already imagine the wedding &quot;Mrwhosetheboss, do you take this iPad to be your wife, to live together in matrimony, to love her, to honor her....&quot; For a moment I was afraid that You spend that money because you have the money. ..😂 . The even better news is that the visualizations and add-ons for this video it will make much more money...🎉 . So why not?? Anyway, nice video and analysis! Takes about 5 minutes of research and maths to say that the M4 is about 25% faster than the M3.<br>M3 was about 20% faster than M2. M4 is about 50% faster than M2.<br><br>1.2*M2*x=1.5*M2<br>x=(1.5*M2)/(1.2*M2)<br>x=1.25 If Apple can improve iPadOS at WWDC, then the iPad would become an easy replacement for many people&#39;s Macs. Without an OS improvement, the iPad is objectively worse than the Mac. Don’t buy iPad Pro base model come with 9 processors 1T byte come with 10 processor apple is ripping off ppl .😢😢😢 Would love to hear what you think about the textured glass decision after living with it for a bit. People made a big deal out of the Steam Deck OLED doing this and how it would affect contrast, and that ended up being effectively a non-issue. The iPad appears to have a much more matte finish, though. I just saw the title and I was like maybe you have a channel on YouTube that you review them?🤭 You said last year you had the other device to sort of free yourself from the device that can do “everything”… so what’s changed? Consider carefully when getting iPad. If you getting iPad, don’t YouTube on it cause your iPhone also do YouTube Most of it sounds like copium. You can do it all on the M1 ipads minus most of the costs. Nice contrasting perspective to MKBHD&#39;s view that powerful tablets are unnecessary. Ur a multi-millionaire, big vro. You know it’s not really gonna matter. 3600 to you is 360 to most ppl, and that’s being conservative. But I get your point in a sense, since you are trying to make a YouTube video, and that creates a more compelling story. Besides niche use cases the price it is not justified. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=184\">3:04</a> iPad bought in Rome, Italy... Cellular connectivity on the iPad is incredible especially for $20 a month… Remember the MS surface pro. 10 years ago.. And the new one has the pen inside the cover. 2700 all in. With core i7 i also use a smart toothbrush Bro what do you do on 8 tb ☠️ Isn&#39;t it weird all ipads still only have 12mp Camara So, I decided to stick to Windows 🙂 When you want wool from sheep Cos you can afford it easily? I&#39;m curious what the durability of that nanocoating will be like. Wouldn&#39;t a better solution be to get a matte screen protector? Much easier to replace if/once it wears out. With the launch of the new iPads, we can expect the prices of the last gen to be slashed. So can you make a video on if we should go for the iPad Pro M2 or iPad Air M2 No terminal! 💩💩 needs macos to be worth that. Mrwhosetheboss or anyone else who can answer this question, what MacBook would you recommend I buy? I’m thinking of purchasing a MacBook for gaming and schoolwork so I want one that has lots of space, very fast, and can handle like high graphic, high quality type games like HSR, GTA5, or Roblox. Any recommendations? Apple sucks. That is all. Me rocking my 9th gen iPad I moved from ipad to Samsung due to the OS ... Samsung OS is night and day ahead of ios!! I definitely do not love being redirected to an app. I LIKE having ONE browser app, as opposed to 1300 individual apps for every single thing I need access to. Apple stopped innovating. It&#39;s sad. I have the iPad Pro M1 with a Magic Keyboard and it isn’t. iPadOS is sadly still the limiting factor in my opinion. MacBooks are just much nicer to work on could two monitors be connected to it to use like a mini mac which is not yet with M4 chip Which sweatshirt are you wearing? It looks really cool and nice! @Mrwhosetheboss Where is your jumper from? . . . Dude,  I guess this time you made a review on a very narrow user frame. I guess most people don&#39;t use ipads instead of their computers, but together. That makes sense for designers, for sure, but also for studying, for making presentations, reading, making notes, watching videos portably, reading sheets on the piano,  even as an extra screen close to the computer for productivity, etc. Nothing justifies a 3k tablet in my opinion, but to reduce using possibilities of tablets to big phones or notebooks of the future is a bit narrow minded in my opinion. I understand why you don&#39;t think it is the best product for your routine, but there are many ways in which tablets are useful on everyday life. I carry my Ipad on a shouderbag almost everywhere I go. No notebook or cellphone will cover that. Repent and believe in the gospel of Jesus and you will be saved 😄 16mins of Arun convincing him self that is not a waste of money to have this tablet :D Bro the iPad kids gonna be going wild😂 bro needs to get a chromebook I could tell you &quot;why&quot; but you tube would cancel me... As Marqus said iPad is an iPad, new Windows tablets are coming with more powerful ARM SoC, I will rather wait. When Apple decide to run MacOS in an iPad I may rethink. Those look too thin in my opinion….i would rather them put more money into the build quality and durability to make it LAST! Rather than cut out .5 ounces here and there. Bro the way I see it, the iPad is an overpriced gimmick and a failed alternative to a Laptop. Like seriously all that M4 juice just to watch Netflix or play PUBG. Now people will defend it by saying you can edit videos and photos on it with peak level of performance but that&#39;s a very small usecase compared to what u get on a full fledged Laptop/Desktop. Like seriously what you&#39;re gonna do with the M4 if it&#39;s paired with the iPad OS, can u run Blender on it or do high level coding or Machine Learning. This would be great product only if they had provided full laptop level compatibility on the software side  rather than sticking 300$ keyboard and trackpad. Well that’s a bit harsh and the majority disagree - for certain people yes that is very true but in reality both have their benefits and disadvantages. If you had an iPad and got used to it you might see the countless benefits but your core point is somewhat justified. I am an iPad user though so I do mostly disagree with you. @@kianandtheviolin I respect your opinion bro !!! you may be enjoying your iPad experience as it fully meets your use-case which may be true for the majority but the thing is that if I&#39;m paying that much money in the name of Laptop Alternative or Laptop replacement, then I expect it to be able do anything a laptop can even if it&#39;s out of my use-case. It&#39;s the same logic why some software engineers tend to buy gaming laptops (windows) even if they don&#39;t game that much. Because as a developer or a designer, it&#39;s always good to have that power and capability in ur hand. Otherwise just don&#39;t sell it as a laptop replacement by putting a M4 level chip and charging 3000$ @@sarthakshukla7217 Thanks for the respect! It’s nice to know there’s not only strongly opinionated and stubborn people with opinions nowadays. For developing of course the way to go is windows or mac because you aren’t making apps on an iPad XD - also it was mentioned in the video that most apps for iPad are better, but I actually disagree with that in lots of cases and agree with you - like I do music tech and compose, and although I have Logic Pro for iPad, I am never going to replace my mac version with that. Mac and Windows are just more versatile for high-performance use cases, and unless you are on the go and use a lot of iPad apps, Mac/Windows is definitely the way to go. The iPad Pro is a device I carry with me all day and can do some but not all of what a laptop can do. My MacBook stays docked on my desk, connected to three external monitors, and can do some but not all of what my iPad can do. Meh And I have been a Pencil user. It will always be shit. For the masses, the macbook air is probably the most utility per dollar you can get by spending on an Apple product iPad needs macos otherwise it is nothing more than a YouTube machine Well there are great apps built for iPad with more features on iPad. Some sort of MacOS support would be good though - like maybe being able to sync it with your Mac account and be able to use a cut down version of MacOS? two panels but OLED to post it on youtube and have adsense rain? I watched on iPad We just need better apps, more pro apps, but even so....  I&#39;m very tempted Only recently been using a Remarkable2. It&#39;s an Apple vs. Orange comparison, mate. Remarkable is designed for a different universe. 5.1K Why? Rich person that&#39;s why <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=476\">7:56</a> what. happened to the camer? you make very good video&#39;s i like them a lot thanks This is basically me trying to justify my last buy that I do not really need 😄 The day I spend that much money on a tablet is the day I book myself into the looney bin, seriously wtf is apple thinking??? Have you had a sneaky Apple sponsorship deal recently? highly doubt you&#39;ll replace a Mac with this... def not for me “Cause I can” end of the video. I usually think of my tablet as a basically infinite notebook. I usually use it for drawing and taking notes in classes, and it&#39;s pretty good for that... But as someone who&#39;s learning IT, I still need my laptop for programming and other heavier tasks, I can&#39;t see myself switching to a tablet, even if there would be a similar quality android tablet. iPad just doesn&#39;t makes any sense for the professional use apart from graphic designers and 2D animators. It&#39;s file organisation system is very poor, it doesn&#39;t have nearly as many softwares a PC or MAC has. It&#39;s very restricted from every department as much as I initially hated on MAC for not being even near as pirate friendly or open to Windows, I started appreciating the heck out of MAC after using the iPad. On top of it, it&#39;s costs as much as a MacBook. Really pointless! his parents had to disown him by now BUT, it is limited , to using iPad OS.... M2 Pro is still the best choice for average users. I don&#39;t like tables, my arm gets tired holding them when I put it on my belly. Notebooks don&#39;t just fall over. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=434\">7:14</a> what is that game called ?😅 Diablo immortal Cant wait for Jerry to Bend that thing in Half 😂😂😂😂😂 Apple junk wait till it goes on the Fritz then get ready to pay a chunk of change to repair it .😡 Did they manage to fix the static build up on the screen? Still Ipad OS so you can&#39;t edit like on your Mac. why was he gawking on the tooth brush like that Just put macos on it, Jesus. I have an iPad Pro and I just don&#39;t get the love for it. Gaming laptop is better at everything besides YouTube. Looks like you are making a good use case for yourself to buy one, no salute at the end😝 still no calculator.... Apple = anti-consumer You know for 3600 you can a make a powerful pc Because you can afford it. End of. If you need storag just get a 2 Terabyte MicroSD™ and insert it into the extendable storage Can&#39;t wait to pick one up for $500 in 3 years For an iPad, seriously? Still a ridiculously overpriced tablet which can never become a full on PC replacement Jerry Rig Everything be like &quot;I&#39;ll have fun with this one!&quot; pls make a vid on realme p1 pro Wow, I think Apple is doing the Balenciaga strategy and testing how dumb their costumers are... The only reason would be because you CAN buy one. No other reason. Who use Tablet nows a day. Its a waste of money. crazy how they all complained abt the price of apple vision pro but are happily paying this much for an ipad I&#39;m hoping that nano coating will come to the iPhones. Amazing how Apple manages to impress even when it was so obvious what they were bringing to the table, I’m eager to see teardowns, drop tests and bend test on this crazy thing and absurdly powerful device. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=22\">0:22</a> me when the soup is too hot because you are a rich youtuber and you dont give a fuck The surface pro left the chat Only The Apple nerds will only Buy this ipad. Out of which 80%(Probably) are Show offs. Who are actually poorer. 😂. At the same time. Real Creators/Designers even if they own one, doesn&#39;t even use much. Bcs the productivity experience what they have doesnt seems convenient for them to use. With the same price, they can do or buy better. It’s not needed to be that thin and the battery could be 20 hours by adding a millimeter. And i‘d put it in a case which has probably them same thickness as the tablet. Did you try to bend it? I suspect there will also be thermal issues as SRAM scaling is over. So that’s the definition of a Tablet. And this falling to the ground will be instant dead. And also its still crippled by not having macOS it makes it not worth it again.. thats a perfect amount of slimness. Now i can add a case without it being BULKY I&#39;m cool with a phone and a MacBook pro Breaking a bone is cheaper than breaking the iPad That&#39;s why my 13 y\\\\o cousin was crying BC she bent her iPad lol Love the sunset effects in the background.. oh .. wait. iGlad indeed. What!!! theres something comforting watching this while not being willing to upgrade to any post 2017 apple product true, its interesting to see what the next generation of devices are capable of doing... but 2017 tech is more than enough for current day to day use @@alexlun4464 yeah at some point theres no visible difference in performance to the average user and anyone who upgrades to a new device with features meant for pros will have to suffer from the sacrifices made for those pro features that they never were planning to use you can&#39;t manage files that well on tablet as on pc Arun, you are definitely one of my favorite tech reviewers, but your presentations are above and beyond everyone else! Thank you for your hard work and dedication! To sum it up, he’s rich You’re using the toothbrush wrong The amount of lies and contradictions this video has is disgusting. Great vid!👏👏....keep it up Team Mrwhosetheboss!💪 Because you are rich.  No other reason. I am watching this on a M1 iPad Pro. Performance still snappy and oled screen still nice. A used M1 iPad is $450. I’d totally recommend to anyone. Bro just bought a Macbooh, but worse I pretty much use my iPad Pro as a laptop and it works real well.  I have a PC desktop that I use for everything else (gaming, development, rendering, etc).  Wish I could justify getting the new iPad Pro but my old IPP is a tank and just won&#39;t quit. try using some of the windows surface products. i for example habe a surface pro 7 and its basicly a tablet and laptop in one (+ not really expensive). its great for school/ work Let me get this straight, apple is good at iPads think again theres a lenovo thinkpad yoga thats better and it have anything like normal pc omg! are you kidding me ? How can people compare iPad to Macbook? Oh yeah if you are only watching YT Plot twist: Samsung makes Apple screens😂😂😂 Once I&#39;ve heard a kid say &quot;money comes, money goes&quot; You guys killed this review I watched over 20 and your review is by far the best great job Only got past the first 6 mins of this video but im kind of disappointed how sold Arun is on this overpriced tablet for people with disposable money.  Apple has a way of $making$ its current users think they need the next best thing. “I’m a very exited man right now” Crazy how parents are gonna buy this just to give it to their toddler Ill save you the time its because he is rich…..your welcome So pretty much like my iPad Air 4th Generation in terms of weights and portability. If you are a software developer or need to work anywhere near that arena - iPads don&#39;t cut it. So you have to have both a MacBook Pro and an iPad. Same goes for video editing - both Davinci Resolve and Final Cut Pro are crippled on the iPad.<br>The iPad will never be a MacBook replacement for professionals.. And oh - also, once you add the iPad keyboard - the combination becomes heavier than a MacBook Air. If you have the money - then yeah, knock yourself out. But it still no where close to a serious device. Better off with MacBook and the most cost effective iPad you can find - and it is still good enough to replace your electronic paper device. That&#39;s like 12 month of rent where i live omg,, im an artist and i know apple tablet are nice. It&#39;s just gonna be my another whishlist someday ill be so rich i will consider getting it . ;-; 3600 usd is soo soo much God nerfed me with money cuz he knew I&#39;d be unstoppable if i had such things lmao but hey,, 🥹🙏🏻 Americans are gonna like the M4 chip for sure. Arun, we are REALLY close to overtaking Apple in subscribers. Just 300,000 to go<br>Let&#39;s do this!🎉🎉🎉 13&quot; iPad Pro with absolutely everything (inclusive AppleCare+, pencil, keyboard) costs $4197 here in Sweden. Outrageous. Apple knows kids are growing up with iPads the same way our parents grew up with Walkmans and desktops, the same way we grew up with laptops and smartphones. These are not for us, but for the next generation of consumers. Money simple Why are your videos dark now? Now I am guarantee getting the iPad 13inch pro 🎉 after this video. apple needs to discontinue either the macbook or the ipad! they are just running out of reasons to distinguish between the two! migrate mac os to ipads or include touch screen functionality on a mac! You know what would actually make the iPad a real deal breaker. It would be if they added a desktop profile that behaves exactly like macOS, kinda like saying &quot;I wish the iPad had both iPadOS and macOS&quot;. Ever since the M1 ipad pro I&#39;ve kinda been annoyed at how the thing looks like it could be Like A Laptop but it really isn&#39;t.  Stage Manager on M1 never seemed to quite work properly for me, either. Get ready to be disappointed as a laptop replacement the OS needs a serious update. for a tablet to cost me so much it needs to do A LOT more. especially already owning an iPad Pro, there&#39;s no reason at all to update. still no mac exchange since file folder and management is still very bad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> what that mouth do ;) Why Apples market cap is over $2trillion lol I would like to state that i dont like to see tablet drifting into the luxury market and apple seems to be pushing this more and more especially because they often underspec cheaper alternatives namely the normal ipad and they overcharge for the ipad air, Sure it&#39;s useful for video/photo editing or even documents. But still pretty useless for software developers. When Visual Studio comes out for it and lets me write full dotnet apps, I may change my mind.  For me, it&#39;s mostly just an entertainment device and doesn&#39;t really need much power for that. I have to say though that im not a big fan of too thin devices, in a thicker one you could theoretically house bigger speakers a better cooling solution for the processor and a bigger battery plus you acheive far more stability. I wouldn&#39;t use it in a magic keyboard to be honest normally logitech builds high quality accessories but im a samsung tab user so what do i know. When someone is so rich that you can&#39;t relate if u wanna write just carry a notebook bruv and write on paper with a normal pen For us minority who use the Lidar a lot, with apps like Recon-3D and Sitescape, the extra muscle is nice. Also watching 3D models of complex buildings without staggering. Did this man just use ... mobile gaming .... as an example of an improved gaming experience.....<br><br>lmao<br><br>We have different use cases, but imo the mobile experience is almost never better than a desktop class app. I own a regular Ipad and the only thing I prefer to do on it is draw with procreate.  I would much rather edit photos, research, write, design in CAD, game, or do pretty much anything on a big monitor and with a pc that is more powerful for half the cost than this Bendgate 2 Pro. Sure if you have plenty of money to throw away, and dont have that demanding of a workload the weight advantage is nice, but used car money for a tablet is hilarious. With all the accessories i suppose this overtakes the vision pro as the most expensive netflix machine. Sorry, you lost me when you praised how simple and &quot;better&quot; it was to photo edit on it but glossed over the 50% longer times to do super intensive things (you know, the kind of stuff you would want a MacBook for but want to replace with an iPad). TLDW - he did it for the clicks on YouTube I don&#39;t agree at all with the &quot;apps are better on mobile then on pc&quot;, but I might not be the mainstream user that uses Apple stuff or even worse, Windows Is no one still gonna mention the fact that the iPad Pro only has 1 camera instead of 2? Now internet I&#39;m gonna expect you to be mature with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> and not do anything rash. You are all better than that, right? The nice thing about the m# macbooks, you can already run the iPad apps... Because you gonna return it right after the multiple videos you gonna make of it I tried the same but at the end, the missing file explorer makes it hard for people who need it. Why? he says it&#39;s better when a product asks you to use their app. I actually hate that, having to install a separate for every thing that i want to do only once or twice. Have to mention how soft the talking to camera shot is. The colours and contrast are also off.<br><br>Your eyes. The most important thing to get right with this kind of video... Look like dolls eyes.<br><br>Has to be shot on a phone. The pixel quality on phones isn&#39;t good enough yet for this to look good or even acceptable. Sorry. <br><br>You should probably stick with larger sensor, dedicated video cameras... I&#39;ve got a 12 year old iPad and it still works perfectly. They are great things - and the screen is still brilliant. Imagine getting green line 🤪😜 I ordered one but the low spec.  But can it replace my &quot;real&quot; computers?  No.  Because if iPadOS.  The hardware is way beyond what the OS is capable of.  Maybe they&#39;ll fix that some day... But probably not. paying almost as much for the new apple pencil as you paid for the e-ink tablet says it all. At this prices, I will expect my devices to fly or is it too much to ask Shoutout to the Remarkable Tablet. I have one for work. Love it. When is apple making a touch screen macbook pro Only real Mr whose the boss fans would like this If the new ipad ran standard macOS it would be an amazing laptop replacement.  If youre a dev, ipadOS 17 is not usable Did they finally make this MacOS or is it still IOS?  Nooooooooooooooo.  We have Tablet windows devices dropping this year, Apple screwed up again. M4? Its not a bmw lol I see Your money, your choice bro. Its understandable, from a content creator standpoint. Tablets needed a massive revamp, in terms of software and hardware, which wasnt really happening all these years. I see the usecase in M4, and developers need to use the potential of M4 to unlock its true power in new apps. Thankfully, lightining is removed. I want to know more about that ink notebook 😄 name, brand, price? Looks goood Aaaaaah.....rich people issues. Do I spend $3600 on a plate of glass, or not?

It will be around 9 lakh in Pakistan When you get your new iPad Pro, you should challenge your editors to use the updated iPad Final Cut Pro to see if an iPad can really replace a Mac. Previous versions still take 10 times longer to use than Mac&#39;s Final Cut Pro. So this new guy to technology never saw iPad before and this seems to be first time using it with the keyboard or hold it for the first time. Someone tell this new guy that laptop cannot be replaced otherwise apple would stop making Macbooks. There&#39;s no excuse to this. You can get a M3 pro mac for this price, what a joke. Someone should help me with ipad please😢 i will appreciate an model 😭🙏 Where was Rick Astley!!! Did I miss him 🤔 TLDR, because he&#39;s got more money than sense. lol So... you would be exchanging you laptop for a tablet that you will add extras to in order to essentially make it into a laptop... lol why? there they know how country where you came from made a deal of loss by setting up iphone assembly facility The title changed from £3k to 3.6k This is what 90% of iPad users went through in 2018 😂 I’m sorry, HOW MUCH??? Why I don’t spend $3600 on an iPad Apple ruining hardware by not updating software for older devices. Anti consumer, greedy and no support and no innovation. Gaming laptop &gt; 3500$ iPad 🤣 Apart from the fact that the Apple&#39;s OS has always been shit in literally all of their devices, clearly including the rather yearly &quot;updated&quot; iphone, it&#39;s simply no surprise. The restrictive nature of apple is obvious in their OS and you simply can&#39;t do crap; compared to other devices from different brands. I had apple for years, and I decided to stop buying their scammy little woke shit products. Stop funding this load of scammers that try to create a standard when in reality they are controlling and restricting you to hell with devices that have hardware that is not worth it compared to other option in the market, and an OS that is the literal definition of &quot;shitty restrictiveness&quot;. Free yourself from this crap. Being positive to pay 3600 for an iPad that is nowhere near MacBook on performance nor in applications. My M1 just working fine. I&#39;ve got an iPad Air M1 and I love writing my notes on it. However, its hard to find the appeal in upgrading when the spec bumps won&#39;t get utilized for my workflow. Also the most annoying thing about the iPad rn for me is just how unresponsive the &quot;mouse&quot; interface feels. It has a very noticeable delay that just makes things feel slow and not worth doing on the iPad rather than macbook or pc for long tasks. Navigating through text using the keyboard is also somehow slow. I&#39;m holding off on upgrading until the software gets alot better (hoping for great software updates to the ipad in WWDC). I just take the moment and embrace the fact MrWho is getting married, congratulations in advance brother.<br>Hitting the pinnacle of life. Oh get a WiFi and cellular connection iPad Pro M4. Well..simple, buy a non pro iPad and let the pro buy those because they are actually for the pro. Yes I can buy pc…mac or windows…but can I take it to the park and work, on the plane, anywhere, backyard….it’s just common sense. Trashing this product when you have better suited product for your needs. reminds me of a better performing Surface Pro @mrwhosetheboss you should make a video about Galaxy tabs9 vs the new Ipad and show each one`s capabilities, otherwise it sounds like you`re biased towards Apple, considering Samsung has been doing everything you said so far in this video, for years, speacially considering the Dex Mode (the old one not the new one) They fixed the iPad MacBook cannibalization problem simply by raising the prices on the iPad 😂 Apple users are such mugs 😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=600\">10:00</a> - I disagree.

Where will we be attending the wedding from?😅 Now why do we need a mac😂 I see no problem on replacing my laptop with a tablet. I actually plan to do so, when I need to use some desktop stuff I can ssh to my workstation and problem solved I live in the US, and I am more excited about the new government lawsuit than I am about the new iPad, lol. Oh and I have that Keyboard, lol. bro didnt buy the ipad, didnt spend $3600, got 1.2 million veiws practically for free as the videa didnt need as much editing or anything, kind of disappointing, i used to like ur videos now they are bad I know it&#39;s a first impression video, but it kinda feels like a review😅 I spent 10 years as a world travel photographer with just a iPhone &amp; Ipad and a bag of Nikons. I now have a collection of iPads about 20 deep. It will change your life if you let it… but you’re gonna need an iPhone too. Sorry.. but welcome. well, you bought it because reviewing it is your job lol Now just put Macos on it.<br><br>That would get me to buy Really Need an ipad, scared to ask my parents though. Buy the 2 TB version just because you can 😊 The new ipad pros also missing one camera. Surprising that nobody talks this. In UK 🇬🇧 and European 🇪🇺 iPad costs 1000$ more in top spec and we don&#39;t get the wall charger in the box 😑 😢 this should be illegal 😂 I absolutely disagree when it comes to apps vs websites. Usually things are buried in apps. Menus in menus in menus. On desktop, it&#39;s vastly easier to navigate. Dude needs to Google surface pro haha.  They did this years ago I prefer website every time. I&#39;m uninstalling as many apps as possible as there&#39;s typically no control over them through a mobile OS. With a website I can block ads, trackers, fingerprinting, sensors... much easier. Bruv, my brother bought an iphone 14 pro, just for him to be on youtube and instagram all day <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> BRO WTF?😂 I’ll buy it from you when you’re done with it 😂 Apple losing their mind, laptops went from 1.5k to 3k+ apple vision 3k+ and now ipad is 3k+ if the next iphone goes up in price, im going android Guys, remember the Iphone 6 bendgate? 😂 Such a better review then Marques, better thought out and explained I felt and told me more about what I thought this iPad could possibly do. It’s not just a spec bump but an entire redesign in a way. Thank you. In fairness, neither of these are reviews. One’s a hands on first impression and the other is an optimistic perspective on how this iPad could replace his current setup. Besides, it literally only got announced yesterday 😂 @@alwinetc exactly Apple should give all their products for free with your free propaganda 😊 No thank you. The Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra is huge and really good for WAY less <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=570\">9:30</a> Can’t wait to hack your blinds and 👻<br>make you think there’s a ghost in the house! where it falls short is external display support, a lot of apps just flat out break when ipad attached to studio display (or a 4k monitor) I&#39;m still waiting for XCode to be on iPad. Blessings🙏🏾 , I  live in Barbados 🇧🇧.  Can I come to your wedding, I&#39;m trying to sort out, renew my   British passport, see my mum and family as the main objective, sorry to use you to change my life. I&#39;ll do a song with you to make up for it.  Big up bro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=220\">3:40</a>  wedding, again 😮? ipad will not replace macbook in short future. apple wants you to buy them all Plus remember a lot of iPad users are female, making it lighter makes it so much easier for them to work it. Which is awesome. writing this on my tab s9 ultra What’s the writing tablet that he had? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=124\">2:04</a> E ink? ReMarkable tablet Hi boss &quot;I really struggle to grasp tablets .... however, I take this reMarkable tablet everywhere I go&quot; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=600\">10:00</a> hard disagree. Who wants to download another shitty App just harvesting all your Data when you can just use a Website? Remember how he promised to make the best phone in the world when he passed apple in subscribers?<br>He dipped on us 😢 for storage solution, try a good NAS(Network-attached storage) with a good 10gbyte port into a wifi6 router and u have unlimited storage in your local network, and with some more configs external network aswell. for nas try QNAP or Synologis brands, and with u like to inovate ugreen is lauching one aswell You spent it because you have no sense of judgement and maybe have too much money as well. Basically tablest are the Meduim option in a fastfood place The crazy thing is that in Brazil that is more than most people&#39;s annual salary Nice If someone gave me one of these, I would love to use it. I would never buy one in 2024 when laptop ultra books fill that niche. Why video quality is bad !? The reason the iPad uses the M series is because the M series is an ARM but ipadOS is really not ideal for a work station... I wish Apple could just allow us to use MacOS on it 2877欧元＝3600美元？？？？are you kidding me？ So does this mean that samsung&#39;s New tablet will have intel core ultra chip or the new snapdragon x elite? If that will be true then competition in this market is gonna rise rapidly. This is a wannabe mac book air with a touchscreen 😂😂 to create content. Small car? Not in America. That won&#39;t even buy you a decent motorcycle Just buy an iPad with an older M chip and save your money. It will not replace your laptop. Just got a Tab S9 Ultra last week and was considering returning it in favour of the new iPad Pro. But the larger screen on the Samsung is genuinely very useful, and the iPad Pro with the keyboard would cost about 80% more than the Tab S9 Ultra with the trackpad keyboard here in the UK - about £800 more (~$1000). I definitely don&#39;t need the extra performance of the iPad, plus the Samsung has expandable storage via MicroSD, and it&#39;s also waterproof. If the next iPad is 14.6&quot;+ then it might change things, but until then... Samsung it is! Kudos to your s24 Ultra! ❤ I am not a &quot;tablet&quot; user in the conventional sense. I use a Surface Pro, which is a &quot;tablet&quot; but does things that a tablet can not. Mostly access to work sites and programs that tablets do not support. Atleast for now. The other reason why I use a Surface Pro and not a phone or laptop is for the pen and supported programs. I take ALOT of hand written notes or use the pen for note taking in briefings or while on the go. Phones are too small for this purpose and most laptops are too heavy to use in a tablet format. So, Surface Pro it is. <b>great post.</b> been on the fence about getting an older (but not ancient) Surface Pro. I just want to know if reads/writes to external media at acceptable speeds. I have a Samsung Tab S6 which works well, but file xfer via any USB still never seems to throughput at speeds, whether flash thumb drives, or external SSD&#39;s, or M2 in USB-enclosure drives, I would have thought transfers would have been faster than it turns out they are... Looking into Surface Pro, this is one of the things I&#39;m concerned about, to be able to swap files between devices from external media sources, I always use up internal drive available space rather quickly and inevitably have to resort to several TB&#39;s &amp; TB&#39;s of external media. @@jimthrowaway One of my work tasks is the reimaging of computers. As I am sure you know, reimaging typically requires gigs of data. My typical image is about 35GBs. I use a Surface Pro 7 on external NVME drives. When a new image is released, transferring the image from the SP to a thumb drive can take about 20 minutes, if memory serves correct. The same transfer to an external NVME drive can take about 10.<br><br>The upside of getting a Surface Pro 8 or 9 is the internal storage can be upgraded easily, as the internal drive is replaceable. They use the M.2 2230 drive size. These used to be hard to come by, but can currently be found on Newegg easily and 1TB drives are running at or below $100 USD. @@SgtSeth I have 2 m.2 drives in USB enclosures right now, a1TB &amp; 2TB. One is a Samsung 980 Pro the other is a generic brand. I don&#39;t work in or specialize in data recovery or reimaging,  I am familiar with backup imaging, and I advocate it over A/V software. I abandoned A/V software over the years eventually in favor of keeping clean virus-free backups of updated OS&#39;es with my software apps freshly installed but not used. <br><br>I have external drives (multiple) containing virus-free installer-kits of all my software apps, plus installation product keys, activation keys, purchase verification details, etc. I have standalone offline &quot;near identical twin&quot; computers I keep to install new apps onto then immediately create backups kept at different storage media for risk management. This is an example of what I described earlier about having multiple TB&#39;s of data. Unlike yours my backup imaging files are <b>far more</b> bare bones and I&#39;ve never had one over 100GB, most in range between 35-50GB.   <br><br>The speeds you mentioned about the Surface Pro are much more to my liking than the Tab 6. Tab 6 mind you btw imo is not a bad device, I like it well for certain things. But my needs are diverse and I&#39;m always looking for good fit options that compliment what I have while adding to it. <br><br>Thanks for all ur info !!! 😎😎 This is ridiculously stupid. All of it. It would be interesting if this Ipad laptop replacement can work, but if it was my friend asking, Id say &quot;dont do it!&quot; this guy &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marqass brownlie I love the effort that you and your team put into your videos. But I have a small remark, I think that you review this device so positively because it helps you work more efficiently. Personally when I look at the price I could never see myself buy it unless if it would improve my work output. So I would suggest you say something along those lines in your video. Because as a consumer this is not a product that you should buy unless it is for work. I&#39;m a little confused, <br><br>no tablets cause he doesn&#39;t see the point because he has a phone<br><br>continues to talk on about the usefulness of the tablet and how sometimes he just needs it <br><br><br><br><br><br>bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh I&#39;m a little confused, <br><br>no tablets cause he doesn&#39;t see the point because he has a phone<br><br>continues to talk on about the usefulness of the tablet and how sometimes he just needs it <br><br><br><br><br><br>bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh lighting for this video is really sweet. a welcomed change. Youtube and netflix never looked better does it bend like the iPhone 6? This guy feels like a paid Apple sponsor. Literally says nothing bad about anything. 😂 You also have Netflix app on Windows laptops which allow you to download :P YOUR A 8 TERABYTE TYPE OF GUY? I have 500 GB and i&#39;ve only used 64! This is why I veer away from the iPads. The iPad Pros are CRAZY expensive now. The only ones who would benefit from all of that would be the influencers, creators, celebrities, and rich people. However, phones spoiled me too much that I can&#39;t look at the iPad Air - probably the best among the iPads for everyone - without my eyes telling me that it&#39;s just a 60Hz LCD screen.<br><br>That&#39;s why I got the Galaxy Tab S9+. Yes, Android is HORRIBLE on tablets, and they just become good enough thanks to Samsung&#39;s DeX - and own ecosystem - as a laptop replacement. It does what I want it to do, it&#39;s not crazy expensive (but still VERY expensive), and has a beautiful screen. Had the iPad Air launched with a 120Hz Mini-LED screen, I would buy it instead since it&#39;ll pair well with my MacBook Air.<br><br>In essence, I wouldn&#39;t buy a $2000 tablet, knowing I have a $1000 MacBook that does things I do everyday better thanks to the MacOS&#39; superiority over any desktop OS (and the iPadOS), and a $1000 tablet that&#39;s half the size of the iPad Pro, that doesn&#39;t touch its performance, but it doesn&#39;t need to because I don&#39;t do influencer and creative stuff anyway. Ive never been into laptops because of the keyboard space so i love ipads! They finally added the function keys to Magic Keyboard I love how it got progressively darker as the video went on It&#39;s almost as if the sun was going down. @@GeeEee75 Thanks captain obvious lol \\u200b@@elliottrogozinski You too! Arun, you can&#39;t play WoW or FFXIV on an iPad (yet).  Keep your laptop! “Filthy Casuals” that&#39;s a wild thing to say 😂😂😂 New Term unlocked 🔓 For NOW... Lets wait and see what Nvidia will cook in their ARM cpu segment. Finally, someone who doesn&#39;t crap all over every new Apple announcement just to get clicks.  Good job.  A major issue with replacing a Macbook Pro with an iPad Pro is the much shorter battery life (as well as the limited high end storage options and iPad OS / Mac OS app issues that you mentioned).  Apple should allow the iPad to immediately switch to Mac OS as soon as a keyboard is connected, or even better, pop up a prompt to either do that or not.  But I don&#39;t know if that will ever happen as long as Apple feels they can get more revenue by selling both products.  But maybe if they do it, they might actually sell <b>MORE</b> hardware! <b>100% right</b> about auto-switching OS upon auto-detect of attached external keypad/keyboard device. That it doesn&#39;t is just another example of power-tripping corporate <b>greed</b> to suck every single penny out of consumers they think they possibly can.... they&#39;ll empty our lint-ridden pants pockets and look under every couch cushion for every penny they can take !!! ....their sense of entitlement is absolutely sickening <i>IMHO</i> ..... 😎😎😎😎😎😎 And the Calculator 😂 It most likely WON’T be as quick as you might be used to while working on your laptop BUT, it is MUCH more convenient….Also, if you ever use more than one monitor at a time when using your laptop, you won’t be able to do that with an ipad. It can handle one extra monitor, but not 2. HOWEVER, one kind of neat thing, is that when you have your ipad close to your laptop, it can be set up to automatically become accessible to your laptop, meaning you’ll only need one interface at that point to access both devices. <br><br>Honestly? If you’re not too familiar with tablets, I think it’s going to be a bit of a learning curve, but not a big one. I suspect that because of the convenience, you’ll likely appreciate more than what you’re presently using. That’s my two cents/P’s worth at any rate. 😊 Apple’s taking Nvidia’s place again… Wait just noticed they already had nvidias place with the iPhones. Imagine 2TB being not enough storage. Samsung is much better than CrApple :) of course you won&#39;t use samsung tablets after all you are a apple fanboy and one of those paid iSheep content creator😂 Welcome back to bendgate, everybody how is the Ipad air , is it actually worth buying ? Watching this on my ipad pro. Its the best gadget i own. I’d much rather have a thick iPad with double the battery First things first, its Apple, its expensive, im not a Fan of the company and its shenanigans, but i have to admit this product looks very nice, and in general seems like it could be a real asset to professional designers and such. it actually seems well thought out and good overall. that said, its not a device for me, as i prefer more open and fair platforms Bro you are getting in the territory of a spoilt reviewer. I understand it&#39;s your job to review new products but now it seems you are trying to hard to explain your upgrades and also influence our lives.<br>Thanks. I’m honestly disappointed in these new iPads I’m still keeping my M2 iPad Pro and my 2nd Gen Pencil these new ones really not that different and have features I don’t need. Man Apple is genius at making people think they need to keep spending more and more money for the same crap😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Uh... You look like you are really enjoying that smart toothbrush too. LOL 🤣 He is brushing his uvula. kids dont get phones they get iPad Pro M4 The Samsung Galaxy tab s9 ultra is 5.5mm thin and has android. just try a samsung tablet... <br>try the tab s9 ultra or wait for the new tab series, but its so unsatisfying that u always test only apple products.. samsung can offer u at least the same performance and experience. As a 4th gen iPad Pro owner, this thing has never lagged or couldn’t handle anything I’ve needed it for. These iPad are all the same product for the average user m1, m2, m3… My 2nd Gens were great until Apple nerfed the software Thinner iPads with larger screens, what could possibly go wrong 😂 Bend gate coming 😂 I see his point though and I kinda agree with it. I would like for there to be some variety. But lol at your comment. Throwback if it happens Software sucks yet😢 Try use a Samsung phone in the Apple Store and see if they kick you out 😂 Imagine supporting the massacre on the Congolese by buying an Apple product 😒 meh All that to just play cocomelon videos thanks for ipad ad i pad os is fucking shit. If they were going to make a pro device they should have gone all the way. Bigger battery, more io, comes with a keyboard. Nobody cares about it being that thin Yeah I mostly agree although I think we could have both. I kind of like that it’s so thin, it does make sense for note taking and whatnot, which is a big reason why I use tablets what were you doing to that toothbrush??? You lost me at &quot;I feel way better when a product tells me to use their app, than when they direct me to a website&quot;.<br>I absolutely despise services that do not have a functional website and instead use apps, like recently I was gonna receive a parcel and the delivery company did <b>not</b> support doing any sort of tracking through anything other than their app, which coincidentally happened to require signing up for an account to even begin using :| Omg yes really good comment<br>I hate when they force you to get on the app I only just noticed this but when you watched these videos on an iPhone the ratio is so good that you don’t lose any video and you still can’t see the notch. I love arun One day, that battery&#39;s gonna die... At this point Apple should trade mark the word &quot;PRO&quot; 😂😂😂😂 pencil PRO? Like Seriously?😊 So. Basically it&#39;s the touch screen MacBook people been asking for years for. But in a way that makes Apple able to get even more money out of you. With added ability to leave some features out of iPad os so you still have to buy a MacBook anyway. Brilliant. Because you are rich Like your background choice <br>Love the way it slowly got dark as the video progressed I am still using a 12.9 inch iPad Pro from 2018. It’s still very responsive but I have to charge it more often. I probably will go with the new 13 inch Air this time. how do you use 8tb But iPad still a iPad , cannot even get some office work done 😂😂 I say only &quot;Jerry rig everything&quot; In ten years all companies will be on board with the tablet. Most likely won&#39;t be apple though. Ayo that toothbrush b-roll Had to pause at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=256\">4:16</a>, thought,  so they want people to ditch the laptop and spend a fortune on a tablet, then another fortune on the case / keyboard to basically create what looks like a laptop, oh and then spend yet more dosh on a pen, er no! I hate apple No matter how much powerfull a tablet gets you always need a laptop Then 3 months later, why I returned the iPad Pro. Thing is, you don&#39;t really need it. Trust me, happened to me. Wow, that was a long rant. Talking of being laughable, you&#39;d never believe that Google tried to relaunch their Pixel tablet yesterday too 🤣😂 Hi, can you tell me or recommend the e-ink writing tab and where to buy it.  Thanks Laptop &#39;quality&#39; processor, that won&#39;t perform the same. Why? You also can&#39;t do the same things as a laptop. While most people will be wasting money for this tablet, since they do little to use the &#39;improved&#39; processor. It is also not a tablet if you&#39;re using the keyboard cover. It is basically modular laptop.  Use case, all apps and not much else is a waste of the processor power and a waste of money. The &#39;pro&#39; use case is not there for the iPad Pro. It will be a while before everything on laptop is available for iPad. As an app and media device, no one needs to be paying $3000, or even $1000. As a professional device, it&#39;s too expensive for not being there yet. really that price??? Eagerly waiting for Jerry&#39;s review of the new iPad 🌚 All that with no keyboard is a scam So this thin ultra expensive ipad is almost as thin as my ancient Xperia 4 tablet. Unless you can play pc games on the iPad, it will never replace the Mac bro recovers the double of the price of that tablet in just one YouTube video lol (if not more) My last iPad Pro suddenly died couple years ago, since then i haven&#39;t get a &quot;new&quot; one, this one seems the perfect one to get. I missed procreate😫 Yo Arun brushing the theeth looks kinda sus☠️ Bro made a video of him buying the tablet to cover the cost. 😮😮 This is the most high tech chip in the world😂😂 Googles sheets is ass on an iPad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=603\">10:03</a> I couldn&#39;t agree less with this point. I despise having to download an app for every single product/company/service under the planet. Every one requiring permissions and access to my phone, more and more crap being installed, more and more chance of data leaks etc. A lot of apps are just a reskinned webpage anyway. I&#39;ve been to restaurants that don&#39;t have Menu&#39;s anymore and you instead have to scan a QR code that takes you to an app....to order a meal in a restaurant.... I hate it. nah that toothbrush part was crazy😂😂 because you don&#39;t know what else to do with your money? nope. Ipad sucks . I want ipad to be good but honestly the holy grail tablet is the hp x11 chromebook . As a developer this chromebook can do tablet stuff but can also run linux apps including vscode.  Ipad is just a bigger iphone . Ipad could be so much more. not gonna lie the moment I saw the magic keyboard being i immediately thought they have now made a second macbook and the apple pencil now has a model with the word&quot;pro&quot;attached to it which sadly was kind of predictable😅 Where is rick Astley? Being a tech youtuber is basically making a whole video in order to justify your purchase. What about that Macs you can install any dmg / pkg and on an iPad you are limited to the store (for now) But can you do development I mean coding on the New ipad?? Who is the better Samsung or IPhone I look at tablets now as a better e-reader. I mainly use my tablets as e-readers with more options and uses than regular e-readers. My 2014 27&quot; imac still works great! I have the iPad Pro12.9 maxed out (from eBay - what a buy) and you haven&#39;t said anything that would make me want to upgrade. This is a 16 minute video of you justifying spending $3600 on a tablet. Which is insane. Oh i love my reMarkable In some ways you lose some pc functionality or apps. But for another you gain thousands of apps that you haven&#39;t had on your PC. You have now a much portable device, which can game better, multimedia better, weights less and do more. That&#39;s why I traded an iphone 12 for an iPad air 4. Oh and if you&#39;re going on bus or walking in a bit insecure area you&#39;re not carrying an expensive phone with you all the time. I&#39;ve got myself a capable but cheap older flagship and keep my iPad at home most of the time where is safe and end up using it more than my phone. what was he doing with toothbrush 💀 iOS 17.5 is only going to extend life to products that don’t have neural cores like the A10X Ipad Pro 10.5.<br><br>The lowest neural core iPad is the A12X and Z iPad Pro models with 8 neural cores. Who knows what iOS 18 has available for all iPads with neural cores. What Camera did you use to record this video? Your face looks dark i honestly feel arun needs a reason to buy the ipad that&#39;s why he&#39;s making thid video and highlighting its &quot;perks&quot;..   just like MKBHD he won&#39;t be able to go more than a month with that glorified tablet, at the end of the day.. its just a glorified tablet! try Samsung tab bro this guy completely lost any common human sense, trying to justify a tablet for 4k get out of here @mrwhosetheboss you for sure use the toothbrush in a different way Its overpriced af It&#39;s criminal what apple charges for storage on devices with a high starting point. The iPad is basically becoming the Microsoft surface with apples on it instead Why can&#39;t  it be $360? Lmao. You can spend $3600 on a bag of chips and we wouldn’t be surprised. You’ll make 10x that amount from your YouTube video. We all know you spend money to make way more money so just making the title “I bought the new iPad” is sufficient. People will watch and you’ll earn your money back and some. pls honor 90 I can see the 6 month review already... &quot;Why I switched back to a MacBook Pro!&quot; I still not buy it. Im sure you&#39;ve bought a macbook pro m1 that you don&#39;t get use out of. Arun, what would i have to do to convince you to send it to me for my creative work. I&#39;ll do..... ANYTHING If you beat Apple(18.9M) at subscriber count, You&#39;d also beat MKBHD(18.8M) and become the no.1 Tech youtuber. Coincidence??<br>PS- everyone please don&#39;t remind me of TechGuruji or Unbox Therapy. Funny how this review is the exact opposite of MKBHD’s opinion. If you carry airpods with you, you can just basically get rid of your phone too<br><br>You can just bring the airport out of the pocket instead of your phone to take calls<br><br>And that will help you reduce screen time and you&#39;ll only do important and necessary work. Insightful. The “golden age” of desktop PCs have come &amp; gone. The “golden age” of the laptop may be coming to an end, and the age of the tablet may be starting. If they make a “bridge” app that gives the look and feel of a laptop, then that’s the point I will be ready to go all in on a tablet. can&#39;t switch from my MacBook Pro unless they build Final Cut Pro and Topaz Video ai for iPad. Even then I wonder if it&#39;ll be powerful enough for Topaz. my current MacBook Pro m3 max still seems to struggle rendering the video in topaz. As a macbook pro user i think id have a better experience and cheaper with a base macbook air 🤷 Can you please buy me an ipad 9 gen and an apple pencil? i spent $2500 on a custom PC. 100x better than a $3600 ipad. will<br>last me 10+ years compared to an ipad. unless they announce a total revamp of the iPad OS, you&#39;ll still have an overpowered tablet held back by the OS and apps. Okay cool vid but the fact that the view from your window moves from morning to night as the video progresses is pretty cool too. Word processing using Word and Google Docs is HORRENDOUS on iPad With our bad economy now a day. Do people really need this? Let&#39;s see, $3600 iPad Pro. $129 pen. $349 keyboard. ($4078) not including tax and recycling fees. WOW! Haha I am always watching you on the ipad-pro not on my Ultra 😂😂 You cannot code on iPads, so I will think of switching, once that happens :). Bro when you spent $3600 plus more money on a pencil plus break the bank again for the keyboard youre not replacing your laptop. You&#39;ve spent laptop money to make an IPAD LOOK like a laptop. If he makes a video he can write this off as tax deductible so he gets a discount via his accountant. Common creater loop hole. Vacuous. But you know that. Many apps are not well designed to run on an ipad...... Games, and design/editing apps, yes, but many many others are not Honestly, most people will put a case on it, so the thin factor just makes the thing way more prone to bending for no reason. Yes it is lighter but what is the point... Yeah but if something is wrong with your iPad, you would have to replace it whole. They don&#39;t fix individual parts.  Interesting for a company that waves about mother nature every single time they get and even film a promotional video with &quot;mother nature&quot; in it right?  As if mother nature would be impressed by them lol M4 for YouTube and what else it’s too expensive might as well buy a pc or stick with my 2022 iPad Pro Hey boss can i have it? Struggling creative with a very old crappy computer having 8tb is ridiculous, just have a NAS drive Nahh not for me unless they remove ipad OS. just put Mac OS.simple I think that the bendgate is coming back 😂 It&#39;s kinda meh , just buy a mac and a iphone , if you really want a tablet for media consumption get the tab s9 ultra . How are you going to grip it  it will just slide out of your hand 😮 Why buy the iPad when there is a Samsung tab 9 ultra No no, i want arun to physically move his current home to a new location instead of moving to a new home 😌😌😌. You can do it buddy 💪💪 It&#39;ll be the iphone 6 bendgate all over again. I feel like people are forgetting, these new iPads are just the first part of the story. They went into as much detail as they could before June, but come wwdc watch a lot more make sense. Take the new Apple Pencil pro, it’s a okay update, people scoff at the new barrel roll gesture. But read between the lines, a gyroscope allows the pencil to recognize its place in space and addition that will work really well with Vision Pro! They needed the hardware in place before they tell us the second part of the story! What’s the big deal about it being thinner? Or thinnest so far? Most people’s gonna have a case over it 3 words: Galaxy Tab S9 lol, The iGlad Is The Worst One Yet! Keep Em Coming Arun! BENDGATE 2.0 LET’S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=730\">12:10</a> did that camera guy touch the ass of what look like marques brownlee in the background or is my 3 hours of sleep are kicking in again? &quot;while samsung tablets are still using mobile chips&quot; i think you&#39;re forgetting that M series are mobile chips arun just because apple puts them in their laptops doesn&#39;t make it a computer chip Can someone do a video Samsung Dex whats with the audio quality the only thing holding ipads back is ipad OS Hm i can say that that &quot; paper&quot;  tablet to brain storm ideas i could help but think &gt;&gt; Hm.... i do all my thumbnail and everything rest under shower and than then just write it on my Mi pad 5 &lt;&lt; that even thout its old design and not something ultra good pro ++ it is still beast for waht i use it . But boss i need to say for these and all past videos ........  WOW bangers!! KEEP IT UP!!!! Keyboard accessory has the same price as a high-end android tablet with it’s own keyboard😁. No lol a high end Samsung galaxy tab s 9 ultra with keyboard will cost you around $1700 for the 1 tb model 3600$$$$???????? What? I don’t have a good phone (both are used and have bad batteries) so I just use my 1st gen 12.9 inch iPad Pro (what I’m watching on), and I hold it with my forearm like a giant watch and it fits almost perfectly and doesn’t feel too heavy. this is how i behave under 10 beers...justifying my apple purchases into oblivion 🤣 &quot;... Man the screen on the iPad are more fragile than my ego and the cost to replace them will cost more than ur marriage...&quot;  Idk which YouTuber who said these but man when I saw the screen these were the things that were occupying my brain Almost 3.5K for an IPad, a cover with a keyboard, and a pen....<br><br>While I&#39;m just here having paid 1K for a samsung tablet that came with all of these things. On top of which the pen charges on the back wirelessly, and the cover taken into consideration the pen giving a good place to keep safe and not lose it.... Remarkable i really need but it is too costly i can&#39;t afford it😢 100% useless try a windows or linux pc for gaming but what if you wait for the m4 macbook tho?

Duh. I like the idea of a tablet workhorse.  I guess it depends on how you work.  Took me about a year to figure out what software works best, but I got there.  I also like mobile software because it&#39;s constantly updated for bugs, features, design. 😁why you spent 3600$ ? ... because youtube drowns you in money 5 years ago I&#39;ve bought a used VW Polo for the same price 😂😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> ayoooooo Well, given that you&#39;re probably going to need to buy an example for testing at some point, might as well throw in a bit more money to get an upgraded model and use it for personal and business needs after the fact. Then you can find out if it&#39;ll actually be as useful for your workflow as you hoped it would be, or if you still benefit from discrete devices for their specialized roles. Personally, I&#39;ve always been terribly fond of the idea of tablets, but as soon as I actually own one, the interest fades because they&#39;re just an inconvenient form factor compared to phones or laptops. They&#39;re more cumbersome to hold than a phone and they don&#39;t work as well on your lap. Maybe the new iPad Pro with the upgraded magic keyboard case and its much lighter weight compared to previous models will mitigate a lot of those concerns. Wow. Ipads are garbage. More money than sense imo<br>But i suppose all this garbage ad money will pay for it with views eh <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=709\">11:49</a> My Premium YouTube account and my Netflix account both allow me to download equally well videos on my laptop, to be viewed offline,(Windows 11) as with mobile devices.

A device that thin with a new Oled Tech is a big NO NO for first buyers.  I&#39;ll wait if this device can be stored safely and get no image retention with that brightness.  Oh!!! I forgot to mention with a M4 and still uses Ipad OS with no AI, It should have IOs  like a Macbook.  But still, M4 this year is a clear message for Qualcom and Intel. Still way too expensive for what it offers, maybe in a few years. For 3600 you would get an insane desktop or a lot better laptop.

What a load of expensive nonsense Apple is dieing That’s not justifiable for the price point. For that money you can get a high end gaming laptop or PC I farted. I stopped being a big tablet person ever since I got my new phone, which is a lot bigger than my old one, but sometimes, I just need a big screen As a developer, an iPad is kinda useless for me in that regard. No code execution, no console, no good IDE :( wheres the ipad pro m3? Samsung note app and stylus is the reason why i still use tab... Samsung tab is my best friend 😄 It feels like it is more than you could ever use in an ipad. Jerry Rig is gonna have a field day with this one 😂 When something feels like its at a tipping point it usually means its a generation or two away from the actual tipping point. Deffo My thoughts exactly. It&#39;s exciting, but I doubt we&#39;re there quiteeee yet Yep. Unless there are some iPad OS fundamental changes his childlike enthusiasm is going to peter off in a few months of purchase and he’ll be making a video entitled “why I went back to my MacBook and dumped my iPad.”<br><br>I predict it will be a middle ground and he’ll end up using his iPad mostly as a second screen for his MacBook. This video just feels like another ad from Apple I DESPISE ipadOS. Even android on tablets isn&#39;t that good. I can&#39;t imagine doing anything on there besides watching Netflix(yes I own an ipad). Then again, I don&#39;t use my laptop for stuff most people do. Also, can we talk about the lack of apks on ipadOS? It sucks. I watched the reveal...gotta say there was a lot of CGI that was noticeable when people were &quot;interacting&quot; with the tablet Wait until you actually you use it. And connect a mouse. And start to scroll… ↕ And connect a screen. Connect a screen and close your iPad in your Keyboad. Or you want to plug in a HDMI cable. Or want to skip an ad but somehow you Magic Keyboard trackpad doesn’t do the click anymore so the next 30 sec ad starts playing.  Nah, I have my iPad Pro 12.9 (the one before M1) for a few years and tried a few times to actually use it, but it’s just to much of a hassle. I love watching this guy lose his mind over technology getting slightly better when you dont really need this much stuff As someone with an iPad from 2019, there&#39;s no way that this is even close to worth it. I have a mac mini and a macbook that I do work on. iPads are glorified streaming screens. And trust me, I love my little streaming screen, but it can&#39;t replace your macbook for most normal work. Bro is starting a new era - the peak of iPad kids (maybe adults too now?) Eeeh someone lost touch with the common man here I keep forgetting just how much apple bias this guy has. This TABLET costs as much as the damn Vision Pro and and can&#39;t even perform as good as a laptop at half the cost and can&#39;t even do nearly the same amount of things as said laptop. The price on this makes this absolutely hilarious and seeing people like you justify it makes me realize just how much you guys don&#39;t know how the average consumer lives. Being there, done that. Came back to my MBP after one year. Everything he said it is true on theory but they don&#39;t work as you expect them to. Limitations start to creep up on multitasking and the terrible file management when moving files between apps. Me too had a workflow that could fit in the iPad Pro but after the honey moon phase ended (about 1 month after I started) I was constantly annoyed about all the limitations of the OS. For me, the iPad is now my entertaining machine, and serves its work propose when light traveling and don&#39;t want to carry my 16 inch with me; for everything else, I use my MBP. Time for a stress test from JerryRigEverything. Just get a iPad 7 I don’t like that Logic Pro 2 didn’t come out with it. I got the 13” pro version cause I needed a new computer. I hope the software update makes it more laptop like functions.

Yes, it’s thin (and probably bendy or too breakable), and the camera is finally in the right place, the screen is sexy, but…nearly 4 grand? I love my Apple products, but for people like me, who squeak by each month on a pathetically parsimonious fixed income, Apple is pricing their products so ridiculously high that they’re squeezing normal ‘un-rich’ customers right out of the market. Add to it, their gouging tactic of forcing customers to buy cables, bricks, and pencils just to use their overpriced products merely adds to the dissatisfaction that’s beginning to burn in a significant way. Over hype to the max...if ai pins are trash hows is this justifiable at this price point. Literally allows apple to sell laptop priced tablet sales now absolutely no real innovative tech but a ridiculously over powdered tablet. People are jokes no wonder Warren sold off apple stocks the writing is on the wall. The hopium, is strong with this one. Jerry rig eats the new ipad for breakfast Omg its an iphone product.what do u expect.helllloooo I&#39;m an iPad pro M1 user and Im disappointed that Apple has crippled it. Just giving it a proper full fledged MacOS only can solve it.<br>Otherwise its just a powerful Youtube and Netflix machine that no one needs 😊 It&#39;s not worth it !!! I use a MacBook Pro and an Android phone .. there is a free program called Syncthings that allows me to sync specific folders from my phone to my laptop. I HIGHLY recommend this app for anyone that doesn&#39;t live fully inside the Apple ecosystem Hi Razor thin devices, fattest profit margins 😁 Surely 70-80% profit on the $3000 iPad I’ve Been iPad Pro and Samsung phone only since 2018 (no laptop), I can definitely do all the things I need to do on my iPad and I’m super used to it by now. I would like to use a Samsung tablet but I need procreate for my job (I know there’s alternatives but this is the standard in my industry and if I change it gets more complicated)<br>I reaaaally hated when they took Fortnite off the App Store, I’m still very salty about it. Fortnite on the iPad Pro + Xbox controller was such a golden combo, even better than on console and definitely miles better than what the Nintendo switch was offering. I wish more games would become mobile. Gaming on an iPad with a controller makes so much sense. I read 3000 as 300 and I was like &quot;finally, an iPad I can afford&quot; Bro, replace a laptop? Does it run Microsoft excel?

What sweatshirt is this?! why is he defending a $3600 phone... Nah, this needs to run proper PC games and apps and have good file organisation for me to consider it. If I just want a tablet I&#39;d get an ipad air All that raw M4 power to watch Netflix &amp; YouTube… pass Sorry but nope. Until the ipad changes to a fully fledged macos like experience with an accessible file system, it is a huge NOPE. But Arun, iPad will always be an iPad. It’s  kept in its own niche for a reason and apple will never enable it to be capable enough to replace a MacBook. Because you’re rich. That’s why. 😂😂😂 I’ve had both iPads and MacBooks in the past. I love the iPad. But at some point the software will limit, frustrate and annoy you more then you think…<br><br>If they would put macOS on the iPad or even make them have both OSes and you can swap, that would be the perfect device.

I am planning on editing videos with mine for the first time, and will be hoping some of you YouTube guys keep us up to date on your experience with that. I chose the 11&quot; because of light weight and the ease of dropping that size into a handbag, tote or backpack. I&#39;ve been traveling and attending meetings with my 11&quot; just that way for years. 13&quot; isn&#39;t as easy a fit. As for cellular, all of my iPads have had it. I love being able to take and make calls on my iPad while I&#39;m working. It will let you scroll through documents, notes, etc., and talk on the phone, with both hands free to work. No juggling multiple devices. Please let us know if you decide this is doing the job well enough to replace your laptop. just feels like a way to make more money why would someone buy a $3600 tablet? Are no one concerned about burn in? Laptop bag smashable Why doesn&#39;t he add energy to his videos anymore?😭 Its ok Arun. We get it.

I&#39;d love to get ahold of a new ipad with at least an m series chip to just kinda tryout for a week or two. Nothing better than a alienware laptop with slapped linux distro ubuntu Business expense written off against the Youtube channel revenue.

Samsung phones use ARM-processors, which is what the whole Apple M-series of chips <i>was originally inspired from.</i> Go ahead, look up the evolution of where M4 &amp; M-series chips in general originated from. ARM-processors, which yes are used in Samsung phones. An Apple M4 is the latest version of its predecessor the M1 which is when apple decided to switch its MacBook Pro&#39;s regular cpu processors for what now is called M-series, which is effectively Apple&#39;s proprietary own in-house version of ARM-processor technology. I think ur comparison between 16gb Samsung to 4gb Apple would be more applicable if it were referring to Windows using INTEL or AMD pentium cpu based 11-22nm architectures  vs Apple&#39;s M-series processors which have continuously gotten smaller &amp; smaller 5nm 3nm... that&#39;s where ur ratio&#39;s were correct in 4:1 more efficient but it&#39;s not between Samsung phones and M-series, it&#39;s between nm-architecture sizes between conventional X86/X64 chips that use larger &amp; more complicated instruction sets which runs slower versus ARM-chips which break down instruction sets into smaller simpler pieces, ARM processes each much faster while generating far less heat, and requires less nm-architecture space to do it. Only exceptionally high-end complex equation math in specially made computers, in fields like aerospace engineering or high-tech medical molecular-level scientific study, justifies the use of complicated-instruction-set processing larger nm-architecture, it was determined. Even what seems like demanding apps like gaming or video-editing can be done much faster with simple-instruction-set instead of complicated-instruction-set processing. It&#39;s smaller, faster, less heat, it&#39;s a cpu-processing technology, not a Samsung phone vs any Apple product.

I’m not very invested in this whole economy so thanks for being the only one that explained it formally :) @@chrisak49I know right! If the price scares you, it’s not made for you, there are Samsung tablets at your level. Bro bought an Apple iPad💀💀💀💀💀💀 Why are you wearing eyeliner Arun? I love this style of video. This is literally what I do in my head every time I want to buy a new tech product, so it&#39;s kind of nice to see someone else go through the same motions. Very relatable and gives a lot of good points. <br>As a side note: When I was choosing a laptop a few years ago, I made a pros and cons list. I feel like that helped me get my thoughts together, and I would recommend trying it if you are crippled with indecision like I always am XD Don&#39;t get an iPad. Get a Brompton folding bike instead (P-class, non-electric) The economy is so bad people have to buy iPads for 4000 dollars. I’ve got the M2 iPad Pro and it is brilliant. I will not pay more than 300 on an iPad until: a) it has a proper filesystem, b) it can work with attachments without making me lose my $hit, and c) it has a proper chromium based browser that supports extensions. Without these three things it will NEVER be a laptop replacement - for me at least. I asked my girl to marry me and she said yes Why he brush his teeth like that I thought my Tab S9 Ultra is thin enough Basic Pen &amp; Paper never looked so attractive. Arun is getting worse everyday, it&#39;s like he didn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s talking about😂. For example, the keyboards feature already exists few years ago💀 Amazing video… I love it every second watching it… and I agree absolutely with everything you said, I guess WWDC it’s the key for the future of iPads. I have an M1 with 2tb that’s it’s actually more capable than my MacBook Pro … I’m excited for the near future i am sri lankan i m poor pls give me lap or pc i cant get pc i am poo<br>r Basically the ipad is behind all the windows tablets that are both tablets and laptops….. minisforum Amd tablet , surface , asus rog z13, some run up to 165hz and have 4k res…..why are people acting amazed for this tech …m4 is still as useless as the m2 on a ipad… great build quality, reliable echo system,  powerful (borderline useless for most things)… don’t ignore the ipad is still playing “catch up” … What is the game that he keeps showing on this? you can draw in 10000 FPS but game in 10 FPS You know you can double tap your regular Apple Pen to change tools or other actions, right? I really do not know😂! How stupid. Just trying to show he has money Found myself in the same boat yesterday... definitely wasn&#39;t planning on buying one but oh well... damn you Tim Cook! ;) Zero point in making this video because you are 100% aware that you are going to buy a Mac when it comes out at WWDC and then your also going to buy the newest iPhone,tablet,and every MacBook or Mac pro in the future. So it’s pointless for this whole video. Explain to me how you plan to replace a Macbook (or any PC) with a tablet that has software that you should just light on fire from how nonsensical it is?  Define ipados as a &quot;simple&quot; system. I define it as neutered.<br>All the reasons you explained as to why you are spending a fortune on this iPad are all excuses. You wanted the big, beautiful tablet and you buy it. You&#39;re not going to replace your Mac with it and you&#39;re not going to stop using that nice, comfortable 400-gram tablet. You do well, you can afford it and you buy it, but tell me you want to do the one that has it bigger I respect you more. Instead you pulled a 16-minute video out of it trying to legitimize your choice. No need, do whatever you want.<br>I will probably buy this iPad pro too. Do I need it? No. Will I replace my M1 Mac (for goodness sake I hate it) or the PC (❤)? NO. Will I like it? Yes. I will buy it. GG. Fool an their money easily parted as they say Well made video and very interesting. You should know you twice said you are planning a new home and “exact same” is redundant. Thank you. Yes Apple… release the new iPad a week after I buy the old one… THIS IS 3 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MY PC!!!! it is just a little more powerful and bigger phone that costs way more than a top tier Windows laptop. Sounds like a big 👎🏻 to me This doesn&#39;t seem like a sincere opinion. Who is making the “I’m a very excited man right now” meme? It&#39;s so simple for me just having a laptop with tablet screen that you can detach One, I&#39;m old I will never watch anything past an Instagram reel on a phone. I have 2 iPads, the M1 iPad Pro and the iPad Mini, that I use mini for my camera stuff. My\\xa0M1 Pad as I call it is what a take unless I going to be gone more than a few days. And to be honest it still does everything I need it to do. I order the M4 because my grandchild needs a update before heading to college. Apple is and has been obsessed with thin and well no one is perfect! I learned years ago that my life works better if I stay in only one ecosystem, so all I have is Apple. My DJI controller and my YoloBox are Android but they are closed systems that I don&#39;t really have to deal with. FYI you want a much cheaper video monitor thats great - use the Accsoon SeeMo and your iPad verses an overpriced monitor. I do love the iPad and a few Apple products, but I really want to understand Apple&#39;s fetish for making everything extremely super thin. Just dreaming about, i forgot 😂 Watching this on a 300$ ipad9😮😅 Imagine replacing your desktop and laptop with just a tablet that you can plug into monitors at your desk, and replacing your phone with a smartwatch that can be connected to your tablet. If you can call with both your tablet and watch, what would you need a phone for? You just went from 2,5kg to 600g and 400g to 100g, and unified all your files onto one device instead of having to send or AirDrop. <br><br>Think about it, what functionality would you lose? You paid 3000k because you could afford it. I am from Malawi and yes I love ipad but as a medical doctor, that&#39;s maybe 8 months of my salary... 300 usd pm I like how you can see the sun slowly set throughout the video! I have a iPad mini 6. It’s one of the greatest devices I’ve ever had. It’s insanely fast never lags like my 15 pro has crazy storage. The screen resolution is amazing. I’m still blown away when I change from low quality to super high on YouTube videos. I couldn’t image the m4 iPad. I would literally just not use it for watching things could have bought 3 gaming PCs Glad u r still using the Samsung Galaxy 24 ultra! It is pretty sick!  Definitely annoying being so locked in with apple cuz essentially u just want to enjoy a cool new phone &amp; it shouldn&#39;t b so difficult to mesh with other brands. This year I spent 1000£ on a Samsung tablet that can do anything. <br>Ended up watching YouTube and twitch on it 95% of my free time.<br>Nothing better to work or gaming on like big fat PC. Image Brawl stars on a 3600 dollar tablet Imagine a kid owning this ipad, just to watch youtube😅 The most expensive recipe book. 80% of my iPad use is to look up recipes in the kitchen when I’m cooking I think iPad is where tech enthusiasts and technologists reach a disagreement. I place iPad and Chromebooks in a similar category. With a ton of workarounds, they can do pretty much anything, but then why not just use a PC? I think they have everything most people need, but if you are a developer, sysadmin, infosec  professional, data analyst, etc the iPad wouldn&#39;t replace your PC. Samsung S8 Ultra 2022 still better than this even with Dex way much better. Still using flawlessly. Zach is gonna have a field day with this one. Tim Cooks happy days ... Job well done !! No matter what you cant justify the price while comparing it even with Macbook bruh the whole Mac functionality with iPad works with all the shortcuts and gestures even with a Logitech keyboard folio and a regular iPad. Nothing new. Same old story.  Nothing exciting about the new iPad Pro. Samsung tablets are the best. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=320\">5:20</a> same price as iPad 10😳 I still can‘t run docker 😢 clown world we live in I’ve had the same experience but sooner I see a lot of people complaining saying that it&#39;s too powerful to just watch Netflix or YouTube or for kids to play games. I&#39;m an artist and this iPad does everything I need and more. This is for people who use it for their profession. If you want to watch Netflix then just get a cheaper one. Stop complaining. They need to allow Mac OS on it to be a full replacement for many industries Because I don’t need a PC. My iPad is my PC. 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️💕 Bro started the video in daylight and finished midnight... Why is this guy yapping about everything that I have known of the ipad for like 4 years. Also for the storage thing its possible to manage it like on PC lol Worst Pre review ever , The problem with the iPad is the OS is not a real platform for pro designers for example , or for someone that codes all day . is only a  faster machine to watch Netflix and youtube Even though this ipad is SOO overkill for what I need it for I cant wait to save up for itt almost there 🤞🤞 No matter how good the tablet is, it will die in 5 years because of the battery. Batteries die no matter how good the product is. Until battery tech improves, devices will die When you have an PC 10x cheaper than the iPad Pro, but you still watch the review 😅 This video is a meat riding masterclass What&#39;s the ARPG shown in the video? I will be amazed if you find moving from a MacBook to the new iPad Pro anything other than an annoyance for much of the time.  I did with the previous iPad Pro.  It’s stuff like how iPadOS handles file extensions and file system that drives you insane.  Until Apple sorts this (if they ever do) and doesn’t use hugely cut down apps (why?!) it will never replace the MacBook. You can tell he’s been sitting there for a while thinking when the morning turns into an evening in the background Do you think that Modern tech companies have neglected the past tech and should make a universal adapter to access past tech to help preserve history??? Let me guess - they pipe the heat of the M4 to the RAM and storage and think that&#39;s a good thing LOL tablet is the only thing that apple beats samsung in Honestly who cares how thin it is? iPads are such a waste of money and I was fooled into buying one too! Hardly use it, phone or tv, everything else is unnecessary. Desktop then for all other things! He was playing diablo immortal  nooooooooooooooo Bro out here justifying 3000$ plate I really like my iPad don’t understand why these iPads are sooo expensive but can’t do what a MacBook can for the same price! But to draw and just to watch movies with the iPad is absolutely amazing! Apple trying to make vision pro seem reasonably priced @mrwhostheboss trust me when I say right now, doing real work on an iPad (I&#39;ve got a M1 11&quot; with a keyboard &amp; Pencil) it&#39;s a nightmare - I believe that the next iPados will make things better - but you never buy a product on the future software. Still waiting for all the Samsung Knightz to respond. Thinner which is more fragile, second camera lense removed to have 1 only, better display and performance and a limited OS that  you will never use the 100% of the chip performance for that price? No thanks. I can build a super computer with that amount and have some left Apple trying to make vision pro seem reasonably priced 400K subscribers to get to apple. 🎉🎉 After really trying to use the iPad as the second computer. I realized that it can be done.  I just found myself going back to a regular computer.  The MacBook Air is great as a second computer. 400K subscribers to get to apple. 🎉🎉 &quot;Look at how rich I am&quot; I have a 1tb M2 iPad Pro (that I will not replace anytime soon) as my portable computing device and I have a Mac at home. I’m perfectly happy with this setup. As some one who uses an iPad for drawing I would love that barrel roll feature on the Apple Pencil Pro… too bad it’s not compatible with my M2 iPad Pro. 😢 Apple trying to make vision pro seem reasonable So I could either get a powerful gaming computer and a normal android tablet or I could get an ipad pro...<br>I understand it&#39;s powerful, but these prices are just getting silly, specially here in Europe, 3600$ is a crazy amount of money. …. So we don’t have to? 😅 The fact that 16% of that cost is taxes is utter rubbish. Can you please do a review on xiaomi&#39;s latest budget phone that is the redmi turbo 3 (rumored to be the Poco F6) would be really interesting too see how far budget phones improved especially this one for less than 300$ having the snapdragon 8s gen3. Thats what I&#39;m waiting for. Sooner or later someone is going to bend this very expensive thing, very easily and bendgate 3.0 will start. Hey I really like the setup. It has a simple, minimalist look and feel. I get AMD tablets more worthy This whole thing reeks like a sponsored post Arun don&#39;t forget your promise on building the most powerful iPhone once you overtake apple in subscribers Why you spent 3k on a nerfed MacBook air I don&#39;t even use Apple but I liked this POV! Terrible price It depends on your lifestyle personally I don&#39;t need one I use a book for writing a phone for everything else and a windows PC for work. And with the introduction of AR glasses it really doesn&#39;t fit in my lifestyle IM HAPPY THAT I NEW BOUGHT ANY APPLE DEVICE IT&#39;S NOT THAT I CAN&#39;T AFFORD BUT I JUST PREFER ANDROID MORE 😂 Why you spent 3k? Because you have the money. Simple! 😌 Also BTD6 is really good on ipad. I love your enthusiasm, it reminds me of the early days of the iPad and iPad Pro where lots of folks in the Apple community were excited by the promise and potential of the iPad, but as the years went on and Apple seemed unwilling or unable to help iPadOS become more powerful and fully-featured, gradually lost that excitement and switched back to using Macs. I suspect you&#39;re going to go on that same journey yourself. If they make iPads any better it will start competing with their own lower end MacBooks or maybe even iMacs. I doubt they wanna risk that. The same reason MacBooks don&#39;t open 360°, probably. The premise of the video is wrong:<br>1) changing only makes sense if the product you are going to buy (the iPad) is cheaper than buying a MacBook, which is not the case<br><br>2) If you complain about the weight of the MacBook Pro but you are willing to go to a tablet that has limited software and that is at most half the performance, you could go directly to a MacBook Air that is much lighter and we fall back to the first point: it is much cheaper<br><br>$3600 allows you:<br>1) buy a macbook air that is useful for productivity, if you need more power, buy a second-hand Macbook pro M1<br>2) buy a PS4 + TV or a $700 PC to play<br>3) Samsung tablet / iPad Air to consume content<br><br>and if you know how to search, you can keep 1/3 of the remaining money, have 3 products that will do each of the functions much better than that iPad Pro would do, they will be easier to resell in the future and I repeat, cheaper. \\u200b@@ascended1924which is why people shouldn&#39;t buy iPad pros... it has an M4 in it for nothing more than an inferior Macbook experience. For the pro teir it should have a a full Mac OS, then the cost could be justified.. it&#39;s for the $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  you wouldn&#39;t watch a review if it was boring to watch, so he has to act Using a device for all your entertainment AND work, surely the battery won&#39;t last you both. Imagine working for 4 hrs with video calls etc etc and then going and Playing an fpp shooter game and still have battery for Netflix binge. I doubt. Interesting stuff 3600$ for big as$ bezels is crazy 5.1mm 😂 why oh why is it that thin.seems so easy to break somehow! Never buying it until it&#39;s free, but that&#39;s just cause I&#39;m lol😅 I wish I could make a video that would pay for my new tech and some every time I wanted new tech 😂 this is business done right. The reason we have highly priced phones is because at some point when the  Contect creators bought these devices they would say that they were reasonable at a highly inflated price range so yep Gadgets are ridiculously expensive now But has it got a calculator app? Can’t wait to see a parent buy this for their kid to watch coco melon and play roblox on it just to laugh directly in their face. most powerful device to play games with freinds So its a macbook but you have to buy it again The only real issue left to be addressed on iPad is the audio stack. every iPad kid&#39;s dream The minute all your positivity will change will be when you open an app … and it forces you to portrait …. When all you want is <br>to use the device, 100% of the time - attached to the keyboard.  Then you will never forgive its stupidity.  And this happens with a lot of apps … they should honestly just merge MacOS and iPad OS. use the MacOS interface when using a keyboard and the iPadOS when not (so basically just MacOS with an iPad mode) my 2nd or 3rd Gen iPad Pro was so good there is absolutely no reason to EVER upgrade it! Well done Apple saving me a fortune! Over 4k on an iPad (cuz of course nothing is included)? Nahhhh. Really appreciate the greed leaking to other brands too cuz hey, they&#39;re making a killing, why shouldn&#39;t we? 🤬 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=732\">12:12</a> Şeytan ayrıntıda 😂 Yes we all know you have a lot of money to spend 🙄 this is exaactly how i used to explain my parents why i need a better laptop for school project, Arun is doing the same, just instead of parents, its us You sure convinced me hate the ipad os cursor. and no, most web apps are better implemented and better furnished with features than their app counterparts like google productivity apps and banking/finance apps. also the file manager is just not as intuitive to use as mac os. ipad os has come a long way but between an ipad and mba i still carry my mba because i know i can seriously get work done without any fustration. even DeX is way usable for my office-heavy use case. oh yea until i need to scribble notes. so that requires an additional lighter ipad mini or until the mystical foldable macbook arrives with (hopefully) pencil support. Is this sponcer by apple????? Kind of sounds like you spunked £3k on a tablet and are trying to convince yourself that its a good idea. ngl the only thing this is good for is for games like genshin iPad pro is overrated Go back to making a prison review 🙄 Watching this video, I couldn&#39;t help but feel torn. On one hand, there&#39;s this undeniable pull of Apple&#39;s sleek gadgets, even though anyone having both the mac and an iPhone would feel the need to buy an iPad well cuz why not? But then, I can&#39;t shake off this nagging feeling that investing in yet another Apple product might not be the wisest move, especially when a good ol&#39; PC could pack a serious punch at a similar price. And tbh the uncertainty over the performance of the new chip is unreal. It&#39;s like Apple&#39;s playing this long game, nudging us to buy into their whole ecosystem. But here&#39;s the thing – even Ytbers seem confused at this point and lets be real they wouldn&#39;t swap their macs performance for an iPad right? <br>ps: would prefer a PC over it That’s too much to pay for iPad 😂 just buy new laptop Like to see a video in about 2 month or 1 year... how you are doing with the iPad. The only thing the ipad is good for is artists who draw. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s an amazing tool for drawing but there aren&#39;t that many other usecases for a $3000 tablet. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=758\">12:38</a> &quot;Those blacks are sooo deep, it&#39;s like you&#39;re starring into the void.&quot; LOL Nobody talking about that 2018 ahh bezel ? like wtf it’s been 6 years at least decrease it by 50% What motorbike game is at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=63\">1:03</a> please? Me explaining to my mum why i need one 😅 Ipads are really great and powerful. But, Samsung tab has dex mode which bring way different or better experiance and alse has way more better multitasking experiance. I think Ipads are more concentrating to editor and content creators. Its 3000+$... The conversation is stopping there. bruh wtf lol is that useless tablet you carry haha. holy shit. Nice I will be getting this for my kid  to enjoy his simplesongs and cocomelon :D Yikes! I use my iPad for art but the prices keep going up. I like the. Because they’re portable but I might as well buy a cintiq. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=607\">10:07</a>. No, I disagree; if given the choice I will always use the website rather to the app on iPad. This is for 2 reasons: 1. Security and privacy, 2. Multi-tasking.<br><br>Security and privacy. In their own app, devs have more ability to mine your data, especially those apps that can runs in the backgrounds (YouTube, Facebook, etc.). While on the website (even on iPadOS), you have options/ability to block that with the browser.<br><br>Multi-tasking. If you are watching a tutorial on YouTube, and want to switch to your amazon page to buy the supplies as instructed; the video/audio feed will get paused (unless you got Premium) and you will have to manually resume it every times you switch back. On the browser, just open another tab.<br><br>Honestly, I think you just got gaslighted by the fancy Apple’s keynote. Because, if you are a daily iPad user, who no longer have a laptop (like me), you would have know that the iPadOS experience is infuriating no matter how many 0.1mm did they shave of the thickness.<br><br>It is the most wasteful £2000 I have ever spent to-date. yall jus have money to jus spend on these things huh? Can it play WarZone Mobile? That&#39;s all that matters. 😂😂 I have a cellular model iPad Pro and it is definitely worth the upgrade. Typically (or at least in the U.S) your carrier will have a subsidized plan for tablets specifically. For me it’s $10/mo to have my iPad connected to cellular and also have a hotspot, it also includes 5G and the ultra wide band too. I think the solution you are looking for is a 360 device. Maybe a new arm based windows 360 device which is also light. Appli will not make a 360 device. Definitely go cellular this video is an advertisement Wow, the pencil finally caught up to samsung huh, how &quot;revolutionary&quot; of them Looks like Arun&#39;s officially sold out to Apple. The new iPad Pro has great hardware, but its tied to an operating system that targets Apple&#39;s lowest performing devices and incentives developers to make their apps usable on those devices. (Nearly) all &quot;professional&quot; apps on iPad use a FRACTION of the hardware&#39;s power and have far superior PC/Mac versions. Calling this a laptop replacement is a downright lie. It is still just an iPad with the same OS. IPhone 15 User be like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> So we don’t have to So an iPad with a filesystem(basically an iPad with MacOS) or a Mac with a touchscreen would be perfect. That&#39;s probably never going to happen but it would be awesome. Apple argue that MacOS is not designed for touch. I tend to agree. Have you used a windows computer with touch? It&#39;s awkward. I think as more applications support iPad OS, we will see the best of both worlds very soon. I do wish they allowed you to install software on them from third party sources though! for me tablets are an absolute must have. i use it nonstop. iPad Pro M4, or a weekend getaway, with $$$ to spare. Hmmm. Decisions, decisions. 🤔🤭 Can we all just agree that what Apple needs to do is create a MacBook Pro that uses an iPad as a detachable screen and the keyboard as a docking station with multiple I/O ports? Problem solved. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=386\">6:26</a> GAME NAME PLS It&#39;s devastating for me to admit but if someone wants to buy a decent tablet then he should look at OnePlus Pad or Huawei MatePad. Those are devices that offer a reasonable balance between hardware and price. Apple doesn&#39;t know what a tablet should be and as an iPad user I would struggle to recommend their product. I’m just annoyed all I wanted was an updated iPad mini Sounds like all of these are Mac problems and not &quot;Desktop&quot; problems in general. It continues to amaze me how caught up people are on Apple devices that are decades behind PC. Microsoft Surface Pro has been doing this since 2013. It&#39;s like device racism. The meat riding is crazy on this one🔥 Because 1 video and you got it back lol Now the limiting factor is the OS @Mrwhosetheboss can i please have your MacBook to begin my coding journey, when you decide to replace it with the iPad 🥺🙏. <b><i>It doesn’t matter how rich I get in life, I’m never buying a $3000 tablet</i></b> 😭💀 I swear this guy is buffing out his videos with long commentary often veering off-topic, to maximize monetization opportunities. Didn&#39;t used to be like this... I agree Unless you draw digitally, I just can’t see why you’d need this over a laptop. I’m pretty positive it’ll turn into a Netflix and YouTube machine for everyone else 😂 trust me as of now the MacBook even with m2 is much better then that ... you still don&#39;t need a iPad MacBook is king .... Xperia X2 still thinner than all of these &quot;thin tablets&quot; It&#39;s still just an iPad, Arun! At this point, i truly believe Apple is knowingly limiting its new user with their Ipad OS, as they know if they allow their user to perform all the task like in Mackbook, people would most likely not buy the next gen MacBook maybe for few years atleast. 😂😂😂<br><br><br>So thats why I appreciate Samsung, as it is flexible and provide complete options like Dex mode and other related features, so that user can take advantage of the new powerful  hardware in its new premium tablet. 😊 Google sheets is just too hard on iPad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=385\">6:25</a> What software app is that? Can’t wait for the update video!😊 What&#39;s that game at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=436\">7:16</a>? These days iPads aren&#39;t for people who want almost a Mac but more than an iPhone. They are for iPad users. I use an M2 iPad Pro simply because the field  apps I need to use for work don&#39;t exist on Mac or Windows. They are only for iOS and need the Lidar stuff, the pencil, and touch screen, the 5G, and the portrait orientation. It&#39;s also my favorite platform for everyday things pretty much leaving my Windows PC only for Blender, Resolve, and Steam. Bro don’t you mean £3000 bcuz u are literally from 🇬🇧 And there comes an ad for that same ipad before the video Wow a paid advertisement before another paid advertisement I just ordered the 13”. My fourth iPad Pro. I wasn’t going to upgrade my 2022 iPad Pro but… OLED. Been waiting for years. Having recently procured two very large ultra-widescreen Philips OLED monitors, OLED TV’s in the house and an iPhone 15 Pro Max, the iPad is the last device without OLED. Until next week anyway. iPhones have had AMOLED for a number of years but I was holding on to my iPhone X until Apple switched to USB-C. If you, like me, are happy that Apple finally adopted USB-C across all devices then send a thank you to your EU representatives because it is the EU which forced Apples hand. Oh, that’s right… We already know yall just over hype shit to the point for no return for no fucking reason Don’t swear kids might watch this Arun u may regret the decision down the line after an year or an update.... <br><br>We all know apple used to force us to do software updates in the tablet and phones compared to Mac.... Which directly impact the performance of the product.... <br><br>It&#39;s just my thought.... But I am eager to know your experience with it and ur opinion on laptop and tablet I am an A Level student and it feels like notetaking and my organisation on the iPad is very nice, I can&#39;t wait for Apple to allow sideloading etc other features when they open up iPadOS Sidelining will barely occur with iPadOS due to Apple&#39;s continuing anti-consumer practices Because you can afford to, while us mere peasants cannot. To talk you out of getting an ipad. If you already have a laptop. What&#39;s the purpose to upgrade. Just use your laptop until it gets outdated. Then buy a iPad at that time.<br><br>Unless you can find a real reason to upgrade other then &quot;oh this is slightly faster then my old one.&quot; Just stick with your old devices. Do Apple Sponsor you? sounds like I have the anwer, to make a youtube video that will make more money than that because people watch apple content way more then any other brands combined. Thank you. I&#39;d love to see tests of android tablets too. Just saying ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ You will regret not using a laptop Ditched my MacBook for a 5th gen iPad Pro a few years back and have not regretted it one bit! We already know yall promotional gag talk &quot; it runs the pro apps , it can replace my wallet..m it can replace my iMac, it can replace my macbook&quot; when it all essentially does the same ..m blah blah blah &quot;Gaming is better on iPad&quot; 😂😂😂<br><br>Show me Cyberpunk using Ultra graphics on this &quot;Beast Gaming Machine&quot; if it even has it and compare that to an equally priced PC!!! L channel, L guy you can&#39;t access external ssd/hdd because off how suck the format is that nano coating thing is nowhere near as good as the anti reflective coating on the s24 ultra Who else has noticed that Arun has REALLY cut down on using text every 2 minutes?<br>The texts were fun and nice buh I guess he found a reason in the analytics to limit it now... 🙂 Can anyone shed any info on the writing tablet at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=125\">2:05</a>??? Thanks Stop spreading miss information that the iPad can replace a laptop. It can now, it can replace a Mac but it can&#39;t replace a Windows laptop. Gucci parfum Buy it try and and then bring it back. I can buy 2 Royal Enfield bikes with that money. Great review. Didn&#39;t see any big changes. To me, the reasons not to buy an iPad stayed the same I’ve had a lot of these thoughts also arun. It’s a tantalizing idea but in practice MacBooks and pcs in general are just way more flexible. It’s a good companion to my laptop but it’s not a replacement. guys if u want it buy the mac air version of the same chip As someone who owns an iPad Pro and uses it for school with the Apple Pencil. I feel as if the iPad is a good “middle ground” for a lot of people. Being able to use my iPad for taking notes while also using it for other purposes instead of having to use 2 separate devices is really helpful. However there are some instances where I have to still use a laptop and I feel like Apple is trying to eliminate the need for 2 devices with these significant performance upgrades. In my opinion, the only real reason to still buy an iPad even after the new release is if you are going to use the Apple Pencil on a regular basis. Expensive and piece of shit, and yall still buy them like they better than the regular ipad Trust me you don’t want to use the iPad app for google docs and sheets. They are very limited! Because it&#39;s your job Imagine a kid dropping this and getting a bunch of cheetoh dust on it 😅 I love mrwhoestehboss Guys dont forget to subscribe to Arun since we need the video of him making the world&#39;s biggest and best iPhone <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=756\">12:36</a> I was not looking at the screen and your wording about the screen made me jump from my chair Still going for the cheapest iPad 🎉 which is no longer cheaper anymore 😅doing a free publicity for apple 😂 @mr arun and dhrisha ......wedding video plz 😁😌 perfect adhd machine now i can play 4 youtube videos and 2 4k movies at once Arun obviously alienated the developers watching the video 😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> ... is there calculator in that ipad Imagine someone trying hard to convince.. No hate but it&#39;s visible file manager nice toothbrush yes Who needs thin tablets? 3000$ for iPad 😮 you are rich pro max 😂<br>I can’t even afford the Magic Keyboard for my iPad Pro 😂 It’s fun watching meehostheboss discover the iPad for the first time. Like he’s mainly excited about things iPad has done for a long time. Welcome! 3k broo Apple keyboard is £350  and on the other hand Xiaomi making tabs for $299 !!! I have a phone that is worth $200 - an absolute beast. 256GB storage (more then I could ever fill up) a PC - mid ranger (CPU - Ryzen 5500, GPU - AMD Radeon RX6600, 500GB Nvme M.2 storage and 2TB SSD, 16GB DDR4 ram) but still, min of 100fps on games and averages of as high as 250 for $600 + $60 for a display(22 inches full hd 100hz) + $50 for a keyboard. My laptop costs Abt $300 pretty good specs as well. I also have 3 pairs of headphones around $100 together+ SmartTV $350 + my Fing Piano if you want another $500. This ALL TOGETHER is $2160... The tablet is how much again?! $3600?! Yeah no I ain&#39;t buying this shit.       <br><br>TLDR: My whole setup(a lot of things - $2160. 1 Ipad - $3600 Someone is going to say &quot;oh a piano can&#39;t be bought for that cheap&quot;. Well it is an old communist mass produced piano it was bought for $150 like 30 years ago so I would say it is not even worth the 500 I gave it So 3600 from apple doesn&#39;t get you a flawless experience<br>Apple fans would say its part of the experiencexD Will it also bent when you hold it a little too firm? Asking for a friend of course. I would like to buy a $3000 car Ever since the MacBooks switched to Apple Silicon and Final Cut Pro app dropped for iPad, I&#39;d get the iPad Pro instead, better value for money, only thing I&#39;d pay more for is storage ofc, like specing it with 1TB of storage. Galaxy S9 ultra tablet better [in my opinion]😊 Still waste of money to buy Prediction: In six weeks time, Arun will make a video explaining why we was wrong to switch from his MacBook. A whole video to convince yourself to buy a ridiculous expensive tablet + keyboard case for pro users while needing it for doing things my old grand mother would do on her iPad gen 6 😁😄 The way u are using ur tooth brush is giving wrong ideas 😅 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> I will be buying the ipad pro 13. I have been holding onto the ipad air first generation for to long. You spent 3000$ on a tablet that has a name sounding like a feminine hygiene product? 🤣Stunning improvements in hardware notwithstanding, that  exhilaration over his never-seen-before &quot;tablet&quot; has been felt by Microsoft Surface Pro owners since around 2015--when the third iteration Surface Pro 3 was released. Speaking firsthand as an owner of five such devices: the original Surface Pro (SP1), the SP3, the SP7, and a Surface Go (SG1) and SG4. APPLE BEING APPLE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥🗣🗣🗣🗣 Finally a iPad vid ❤❤ Same 12 mp camera than the other tablets 😵 I just bought a Ipad pro 11 4 inch :( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=928\">15:28</a> You&#39;re gonna miss the File System Organization a lot, I mean disabling-ly lot! This has to be Arun&#39;s personal opinion for his own usage, as this is just too much power and cost for the average &#39;tablet&#39; user. MKBHD&#39;s review of the iPad resonates more with me as a casual tablet user. I&#39;m 9 mins 56 seconds in, and dang ARUN.... &quot;filthy casuals&quot; LOL! Somebody tell this guy about the onyx boox note air3c to replace his remarkable. He can do alot in that The tech space will always have different stages of development, so that means we will have different uses for different products. Apple has been smart about this. I have a iPhone, iPad, iMac and a Chromebook (Apple user since 1982. Apple owner since 1986).  If you have several devices, you&#39;ll find different uses for them. I use the phone primarily for phone calls and texting (more texting than calls). The iPad is my go to device at home. Media consumption, email, texting, mostly. The chromebook is for writing on the road or away from my office setup at home. Each device has come to fill a comfortable niche in my life. I think Apple realizes that we&#39;re not at the point in hardware/software development where one device works well for all use cases. It&#39;s a balancing act, not always handled well (see the disastrous Apple product line in the 1990s). The world has become pretty well integrated into and dependent upon internet/digital connections over the last 25 years. I feel for most people who only have a phone to connect with the world. Depending on what they need to do, they operate at a distinct disadvantage. I think Apple could do more to provide a robust secondary/refurbish market at a lower price point for slightly older products. i really like the aspect ratio of this video ❤❤❤ Well don&#39;t watch it in on the iPad because it&#39;s the wrong ratio for video And more... that not you Aron, and as well not Marques arent talking about neither... (M3 Chip issue) Because you are rich.. probably would say bad with money as well though probably you paid for it just by posting this video. Bro you’re a millionaire. Just buy it already 😂😂. wtf are you talking about you don’t want to add another cellular bill?  😂😂😂. I find the hiding interesting from Apple that they had issues with the M3 Chips which cant be solved by software because it is Hardware based and how proud they are to jump from M2-M4... but with the wrong reason...<br><br>“Researchers have discovered a new unpatchable security flaw that can break encryption on the best MacBooks if exploited by an attacker...<br>Its about the M3 Chips... If you think the iPad is a laptop replacement you&#39;re out of your mind. Rich Gen alpha iPad kids after watching this video be like:<br><br>“All my fellas” 🎵 Great advert It would be great if Apple Sponsored this video 😊 ipad pro is slowly becoming a touch screen macbook Spending 2k to use it for gaming. wait until we see the &quot;bend test&quot; 😂 Nobody wanted it to be thinner. Bendgate 2024. Can&#39;t wait for Zack to get his hands on it Nice promotion, ₹5 credited to bank Great 😅 apple glazer Well, if ultimate convenience and portability is the goal, I guess that fits the bill.  As a Windows PC guy myself, I wouldn&#39;t be able to replace my laptop experience as seamlessly as a MacBook user could with an iPad but it&#39;d be nice if I could.  $3600 is pretty ridiculous though. Every review says that the M4 its not a needed upgrade and that a M1 could have done the same in 90% of cases. So, why Android Tablets with phone chips (that have gotten as powerful as a M1 Pro.) should be a problem? I swore they said Final Cut, and Logic Pro 2, meaning only Logic Pro was the 2 👀 Switching between apps is a nightmare, tried using an ipad as a computer for 2 weeks, horrendous experience. Went back to my MacBook so fast. Can’t download torrents I just want an OLED panel, maybe the pen, LIDAR for 3D art and kickstarting 3D printing, and that&#39;s it...<br>and that&#39;s $1000 right there.<br><br>Why doesn&#39;t the Air at least have the 120Hz refresh rate 😭 So, if you wanna use the iPad as a Mac you have to buy a magic keyboard, and a pen just to have it as a more expensive less powerful version of the Mac. Yeah cool nice shirt you are wearing. can you tell me what shirt is that? How little he knows that apps are different for iPhone and iPad lmao You think 10 years ago was the first PC years wth Bend gate but more easier. I bought mine the minute the event ended. I use my M2 iPad Pro all day every day for school. I&#39;m a college student, about to end year two of eight. I will be using an iPad for a long time. I couldn&#39;t care less about new iPhones or MacBooks, but I&#39;ve been stoked on this new iPad since I found out about it! All of my textbooks are on my iPad in PDF form, I do all of my assignments on my iPad, take all my notes... instead of packing around a 50 lbs backpack, I carry an iPad &amp; Apple Pencil. It&#39;s revolutionary as a student. <br>But! I would have rather have had more battery than &quot;the thinnest Apple product ever.&quot;  That&#39;s my big complaint. Waiting for jerryrigeverything 😅 bro shifted from a tech youtuber  to a lifestyle youtuber 😅 Bixby multitasking 😅 its an iPad you realize that I cant code on it.  So why use it ? Why do we even let Apple be a company? If it was a company in the EU, they&#39;d have shut it down already Crazy. Now my Tab S9U feels thick as a brick with whole 5.5mm thickness.<br>So 0.4mm od the thickness for 2+k$.<br>Apple again reinvented the wheel and every shill reviewer is gushing in pleasure. No pc gaming game creating and so much more windows is the best That&#39;s a apple pc price pine apple pen Original Title: iPad Pro M4 Hands on - Why I just bought it. Dont see a difference<br>My iPad whenever it goes 120fps it overheats after an hour<br>I got the last version and I don’t think the new one can fix that issue Eventually oled in the air 🤞 LOL. Overpriced and stupid vain glory item? Nope only idiots will buy this Perfect mobile gaming device 😎 What is that game at 7.12 That&#39;s one expensive cutting board try tab s9 ultra Just wondering if this video is sponsored by Apple I have to mention that as a designer/artist who is upgrading to this tablet with a tradein, I&#39;m getting the 1200eur 13&quot;, 512gb wifi model. I can knock off half of it with a trade in, and it pays for itself in about a week/fortnight, so its definitely worth it for me. The 3k version is a little nuts though, I just can&#39;t justify it for myself in any way. It&#39;s nothing more than a portable mini cintiq (tho now with better features than a cintiq imho). because you have too much money bro. thats why you are buying it. that and you have the discipline of a child. Apple needs to take a note from Samsung’s DEX and just make a button that flips to MacOS. Watching this nice piece of electronic on my GREAT Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 plus OLED-SCREEN 😅 ... Re-- Design? Arun, you missed the mark with this one in my opinion. I feel like this video is more of an excuse for you, personally, to get an ipad. iPad hardware is stopped by its software. It is not there yet. I have never spent more than 80 dollars on any kind of device Oof, I wasn&#39;t expecting to hear someone wanting to move to apps. I&#39;m post-app, because they will all be non-functional in a few years because the associated services are gone, or their servers have been breached and your data is out there. it doesn&#39;t have a calculator!!! 😔 Why do influencers want us to believe that their tech purchases are “spontaneous” I thought in EU, everything is free, so you have unlimited cash to buy whatever you like? <br>Joke aside, I&#39;m excited for the new ipad pro. It works perfectly for tethering with my sony camera for quick capture and the screen brightness is just a god sent in many situations. Instead of having the Keyboard stuck under/to the screen I like to use a separate BT Keyboard. It is more ergonomic if you place the Pad on sth. high up.  (and I have no use for a touchpad). The Problem with Apps is you can&#39;t roll back to an older version without an extra software on a PC or Mac. Apps do not always get better and some are much worse then older versions. Also to handle one file ON the iPad from on app to  another App, to another App is a pain: You end up with duplicates. It is better when you have a central cloud drive. I know people who are knee deep in Apple, but still say you can&#39;t work with the iPad it is a toy ( a very capable toy).  When you can work with it you must have a very good fitting app or an online workflow. How would you compare the Tab S9 Ultra with the Ipad Pro 13&quot; M4 2024? Please do not use an iPhone instead a Galaxy Phone! Please! I spent $2383 with taxes <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a> but upgrading from my 2018. I think it will be worth it. Almost $2500!? (This is including the Apple Magic Keyboard and Pencil which comes separately) First the Apple Vision Pro and now this. Soon Apple will retail their Pro Max series at $1400 for their base model and call it justified because of all their “new apple” features. I thought Samsung’s Galaxy Ultra Tab series was expensive at $1300 for 12gb Ram and 512gb of storage which is enough for most people.<br><br>Edit: People these days think, expensive = High quality<br>Lower price = Straight up horrible quality Unless they change what else you can do in the next version of iPad OS 18, I rather see myself grabbing a 13&quot; MacBook Air for about 2/3 the price of the iPad Pro with Keyboard. <br>I already have a 2020 iPad Pro and find myself constantly hitting barriers that make doing things cumbersome. And somethings are just not possible at all from a developer perspective. I was into having a Linux tablet but found nothing that would feel good and be upgradable. So I stick with a laptop. I am watching this with my samsung s6 lite🙋\\u200d♂️🦝🌹 Can it run calculator tho? samsung introducing dex back in  (idk probably 20 yrs ago)<br>Apple today: we&#39;ve reinvented the tablet experience by making a desktop mode :D Consumers don´t care if they spent 3000 on a tablet, they are the ones to blame because they spend thousands on Apple devices and subscriptions and by so rising the price bar and cost for future Apple products. <br><br>Apple is probably laughing at consumers. waiting for jerryrigeverything to bend it🤣🤣 definitely this ipad very good for gaming pubg mobile MKBHD is a good reviewer and I usually watch his videos.<br><br>But  Mrwhoosetheboss is the best Apple reviewer. I can&#39;t deny but MKBHD&#39;s Apple reviews aren&#39;t honest and non-constructive, sort of biased. But Arun, really judges these mediocore Apple products. Imagine paying 3 grand for a tablet that doesn&#39;t have a calculator😂 Reply to the title Because you earn enough money to spend on that thing 😂 My tablet cost $79.00.<br> I&#39;m watching you video on it.😼 why? Because you have way too much money . Simple. hahaha Day 2 of asking @Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop. I use OneDrive on my iPad and Macbook for easy transition between PC and mac. It&#39;s definitely helped, sometimes the syncing is slow, but it&#39;s a good way for the carryover without having to pick one or the other. Airpods Pro is the only Apple product I own I’m very careful with my electronics, but once when I was a kid I got my first iPad. I was playing on it while laying on the bed, and it slipped off and smashed. I hid it from everyone and continued to use it lol. I regret not saying anything since it was likely under warranty. This video sounds like when you try to convince your parents to buy you a ipad. lol I was thinking the same, when M1 iPad came out and I bought it back then. <br>It&#39;s laying in my drawer most of the time now.<br>Apps are cool and all, but then I get into situations where my bank asks to log on with a pc browser to complete the task... The iPad is hindered by its operating system. I hate my iPad Pro. The worst decision I&#39;ve made on an electronic device. saying that samsung sucks only cuz they use mobile chips is like saying that there is no good android device. believe it or not, snapdragon is kinda the king Hes going to be so upset about the battery life comnig from a 16mbp Waste of money, they removed the ultrawide camera and mmw 5G. Doesn’t seem like much of an upgrade from my M2 iPad Pro. The reality is that Apple will keep you(isheeps) buying their overpriced tech. They are selling a brand and not innovation. Bro you can&#39;t do coding and programming in it Don&#39;t buy this🚮 Love the set. Looks very cinematic you somehow managed to convince me that this year iPad Pro is very worth the price lol 🤔🤔🤔 Shoutout to all the Jeff Bezos&#39; who will enjoy this product 😅 I love my iPad. Definitely my all time favourite device. But iPadOS is simply not there. Especially when you have enough power to run MacOS. It’s kinda wasted.<br><br>But I still love it, tho. Imagine all the cocomelon on this😂😂 Old title: iPad Pro M4 Hands on - Why i just bought it. Now all that&#39;s you need is a smart iPadOS and Bob&#39;s your uncle... Honestly, I’d just get a windows laptop that has a touchscreen. Will probably do most of the thing you mentioned just about fine (and while yes, some will do worse, some will be better) People who don’t like iPads have never used one. I was in that situation a year ago and now my iPad Air is my most used device. Why. Without macOS. It sucks. Lol Phones took git gud literally I like watching people spending 3000$ to replace 6000$ tech that they already have. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=520\">8:40</a> i think oled is still an oled when it comes to reflection handling, resulting in lower black levels when there is a light behind Can’t wait for JerryRig to snap it in half and create an iPad Pro Fold. Can someone explain why we don’t install Mac OS on iPad since they already use M series chip? worst product iPad is still holding these back. Getting tired of Arun saying how much money he spends on things. What I do is, I bring phone and iPad to places on the car I use iPad if not driving and if like I work I use laptop Fun fact: if an android tablet was so thin it snapped in half when you try to bend it, nobody would care :D If Apple ever makes an iPad with a mac OS (maybe even with App integration) I would instantly get one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=690\">11:30</a> this raises a point, why are websites clunky in the first place? I feel like something is limiting the internet and its not internet speeds, because we got gbps speeds enough to download full apps instantly, why arent websites as smooth and integrated as apps? I designed the website of my store to FEEL like an app, but its clunky too! And there is nothingnwe can do about it because it seems like we cant access full system resources and graphics power...<br><br>You cant have a website render a 3d thing locally in real time, this needs to change especially with vision pro Ipad pro or galaxy tab: surface pro is my choice it speaks for itself what the ipad wants to be but cant, what a shame That&#39;&#39;s just stupid......$3k on a tablet. 1.Because promoting Apple products, and maintaining a solid business relationship with them, is an important part of your own business strategy, as a tech influencer? 2. It&#39;s a business expense - you claim the money back😂🙃 still no Instagram for ipad I&#39;d really love to pick one up, but the cost is just not within reach for me at the moment. I bought my 512gb 12.9 inch pro new when it came out... in 2017. First pro motion model. It&#39;s got some backlight bleed on the edges, but it&#39;s fine otherwise. It&#39;s held up far better than I expected. <br><br>I&#39;m a bit skeptical about buying an oled tablet as well, though, considering how long I&#39;ve kept this one. I&#39;m not a power user, and I&#39;m debating on just picking up the mini LED one from 2022, assuming they&#39;ll be a little cheaper now as they sell out. &quot;You have to buy a new one&quot;...Apple really wants everybody to be BROKE!!! can you do development on ipad? <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg\"></a> great now play fortnite on it Ipad Pro is my most favorite device from Apple. I use it way more than my phone and mac. Can’t wait to get this new one “IPaD iS jUsT aN oVeRpOwErEd NeTfLiX / YoUtUbE mAcHiNe!!!” &gt;&gt;&gt; tell me you don’t know how to use an iPad without telling me you don’t know how to use an iPad this is an april fool&#39;s joke,right? That toothbrush scene lookin a little sus😂 I personally, hate when the websites try to force me to use their app. Most of the time its basically the same thing only they have more control like push notifications.<br>Id rather have bookmarks than apps that just take up space for applications that require internet connection to use anyways Dude thinks the iPad just became a laptop replacement in 2024, while everything he mentions is already there since 6 years 😂 Eh, the trackpad is fine... I don&#39;t care that it isn&#39;t as big... it works better than the Macbook trackpad.  I basically find the Macbook trackpad to be about 30% effective compared to a Windows laptop... I always use my Logitech MX Master S3... always.<br><br>I need to be able to run macOS apps on the iPad Pro to upgrade to the latest one.  I have had every iPad Pro since release until they switched to the M-series chips.  I can&#39;t justify it until I can use it and not bring my Macbook with me.  I have been pretty close to this in the past by remoting into computers that I leave at home.  I do find many of the iOS apps better than the macOS versions.  But, I would prefer to have the full Microsoft Office experience... I need a full install of Visual Studio Code and be able to load related dev tools.  I don&#39;t need it to be powerful, I just need to develop and push the code... it can be tested and executed automatically via my CI/CD pipelines.<br><br>EDIT 1: You can download videos just fine on macOS... and iOS/iPadOS without using the app.  Apple Shortcuts is rather handy for a low-code approach to it.<br><br>EDIT 2: I have always had cellular on my iPad Pros.  For me, it is only $10/mo extra as included in my mobile service contract.  Super handy to not have to using the sharing on my iPhone and run its battery down, as well, since it is pumping more data through it.<br><br>EDIT 3: Oh, one of the awesome features of the iPad (any iPad)... it can be a secondary screen for your Macbook, which is very handy when traveling if you&#39;re accustomed to having lots of screen real estate. Get a prenuptual bro ... seriously &quot;wow&quot;<br><br>            -tim cook bro tryn to earn the cost of the iPad through the video before even buying I can&#39;t wait until JerryRigEverything does the bend test on this iPad. He&#39;s gonna have a great time watching this thing turn into a book. I disagree with him, I have used an  iPad as an Laptop replacement and need to admit that I couldn‘t live like this. You are so restrained with what apps you use and for me most times iPad Apps are way worse than their Laptop counterpart and there are many Phone Apps you can‘t even use/download for the iPad, the port story is a whole other story, I can‘t have the jerky haptics with the touchpad and the keyboard, I am missing my desktop, its more difficult to use dokuments and save them (the files app is an absolute menace), the OS is cleaner (and you have more possibilities), browsing works way better (you can have addons much more easily) and in general the only real benefit you have is the touchscreen. Imo if you really want that pen and touchscreen and try to replace your mac you should look into some of the microsoft counterparts that offer a much better compromise of laptop and tablet (I for example like the Lenovo X1) as much as I agree that apple products are of superior quality, I also have a very hard time agreeing with their prices. And we the people keep fueling their drive to increase prices, because we &quot;must&quot; have and show off our apple products. You use all the smart tech to compensate for your lack of smarts WHAT THE SHELL WEREE YOU DOING TO YHAT TOOTH BRUSH is there a calculator tho Bruh just buy a Windows tablet with good specs and be happy I already have an M2 ipad pro, and in my head watching this video I was like &quot;I dont want it, i dont need it.&quot;  lol. Also Don&#39;t buy NANO texture glass, any screen protector will hinder your resolution like crazy Xcode... The Imaginations, The Power Of This Tablet, Goes On Ultimate Gaming Tablet. Why does every YouTuber assume that most people&#39;s daily work involves video editing, photo editing, and drawing arts? 😅 While in reality, for most of us, the real value of an iPad is most likely entertainment consumption, making the iPad Pro completely overkill for most, not to mention the price.  Moreover, a 13 IPad Pro + Magic Keyboard might still weigh more than a MBA 13. Or writing, MS teams, Outlook, note taking, research.  All with a long battery, pen and cellular data.  It’s like some of these people have never worked an office job.  It might be overkill but if I’m using it all day I want the nice display and premium build. Why would you want nano coating which diminishes deep true black OLED Crazy. You have GAS First of all good video. But now my experience. (iPad Pro M1 12.9)<br><br>For tasks like writing, drawing, office or editing photos and even basic video cutting the iPad works well.<br><br>A big problem is that iPadOS is still very similar to iOS. Most apps are missing features which exist on their mac versions.<br>Using an iPad for coding is straight out impossible. In that case iPadOS is too closed.<br>Also other apps like PowerPoint don&#39;t really work for me either.<br>The one time i tried to use the iPad app it didn&#39;t let me insert pictures. Probably just a bug. Advanced features are also missing. That&#39;s a deal breaker.<br><br>Switching apps while downloading or rendering something is in most cases not possible, because it will cancel the the current operation.<br>Stage manager is cool to have, but far from perfect. For me it sometimes even led to crashing the whole iPad. 😐<br><br>My conclusion is that the iPad isn&#39;t close to replacing a laptop / mac, but for a tablet it is excellent. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=622\">10:22</a> actually google docs on iPad has a killer feature that you can only get on desktop using extension on desktop.<br><br>Dark Mode. Imagine buying a 4200$ tablet because you need the keyboard and the pencil. THis Tablet would need to be a personal companion robot able to manage and solve half the problems in my life to be worth that much money. Is it just me or are those guys at apple slowly lose the grip on reality. You can buy tools for that kind of money that can let you work in many fields. Also apps are mostly web based services anyway. So a clunky website is what you are using in many apps as well. Creators say the same shit every time a new iPad Pro drops. No, it’s not replacing your laptop because it can’t run the software your laptop can run and without the software support I don’t care if it has an M9000 chip inside it’s not replacing a computer. Mobile games are NOT games!! If you want to play games, then play them on Windows or Linux, and if you want them mobile, then get them on one of Windows handhelds or the Steam Deck. I have replaced my Windows PC with an iPad with external screen and keyboard. but it doesn&#39;t work so well, the external keyboard fails every day, so I have to use the &quot;onscreen keyboard&quot; or move the app from one screen to the other screen and back again, to get the keyboard working again. It’s the accessories that come with the iPad that makes it so addicting. and yet the S24U has more power The push for thinner and thinner devices is awful.  It just makes them less repairable and easier to damage, so you need a case, and thus any advantage of the thinness is gone. No matter how much powerful Apple makes their iPads, it will NEVER be a laptop, just due to how much apple limits their iPad OS to be just a bigger phone UI, rather than something that has close to laptop functionality with software capable enough to run MacOS games and tabs, while also having the capability to use it as a big Phone/Tablet with its form factor, kinda like Samsung Dex and its OneUI OS. jerryrigeverything is gonna blow the shit out of this ipad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=600\">10:00</a> can&#39;t say I agree, I hate downloading apps for everything. Currently have like 30 apps just for pubs and restaurants I’m still using the old iPad Pro that supported the original pencil. I occasionally draw but the tablet is just my face time and internet shopping device at this point I’d be super keen moving to an iPad if Logic Pro wasn’t ass on it The max configuration is 3k if you get the 2tb and everything with it which is crazy. I can get a 4090 pc with that price so is it worth it???? Obviously not homie ! So it&#39;s an iPad. That&#39;s skinnier. Cool. Back to laptop The 5th gen iPad air is the only apple device I own, and I&#39;m super happy with it. That being said, at precisely no point have I ever thought &quot;this device is too thick.&quot; The current profile is completely fine and the new one is a negative if anything. <br><br>My biggest problem with the iPad is the software. It&#39;s great for college note taking, but that hardware is clearly capable of more. Why can&#39;t l boot it into macOS or Linux and run desktop programs? This could genuinely replace the laptop and the desktop for a lot of people, but Apple intentionally locked it down to protect their bottom line. I can&#39;t even sideload on the stupid thing! Very frustrating to think about the wasted potential, even if what we have is still good. Please help me to select from 11 and 13 inch ipad pro. ...because you&#39;re loaded? 😉 iPad should be able to switch to MacOS when ever you want, would be a massive feature people have been oblivious to Apple&#39;s amazing design plan.  Opposite to what Windows did trying to merge tablet and laptop design with windows 8 in one quick update, Apple has slowly been merging the two platforms over the past decade slowly.  Genius really. iPad Pro should run OSX, period Apple introducing a button on their pencil as revolutionary, while Samsung had the button for literally forever... This is Apples version of an all in one laptop. That toothbrush b-roll looked so wrong… Crazy amount to spend in consolidating devices and reduce weight 🤔 Apple sellout😔 Sorry, but iOS still sucks and is the main thing that holds back iPads from being worth dropping any amount of money on compared to an actual laptop You bought it because you can afford it even if you don&#39;t use it I think they are trying to teach rich parents a lesson when the kid eventually breaks the ipad Sooooo listen fellas vision pro flopped let&#39;s see if we can get them to buy an iPad for three grand 🥴😅 yall are slow That&#39;s what folding phones did for me I haven&#39;t missed steam deck in ages F PC level prices. Y’all noticed he’s in another location Bro......I bought a Samsung galaxy tab s8 ultra a couple years ago on sale for $730. It&#39;s the best tablet I have ever owned, and I couldn&#39;t imagine paying anything more. Those APPLE prIcess are FN INSANE! 😮 It’s a no from me. IOS apples and Mac OS apps are not interchangeable. Horses for courses. Yeah, that will change my life... isn&#39;t there a Microsoft laptop for what he&#39;s explaining She from the right state my boyyyy lol 3600$? Nahh my mobile costs like 200$ and has 120hz and almost every feature Waste of money !!!!! Samsung Dex... S Pen..... Keyboard cover with touchpad... All available for years now. <br>I guess you have to decide if it&#39;s worth thousands more for the processing power. Absolutely no way is this justifiable other than buying it and writing it off as a tax expense for a YouTube video… When you realize you’re still stuck using iPadOS…. 😭 Part 1 - I&#39;m getting the worlds most expensive tablet. Why didn&#39;t I know about these before. Part 2 - How I am going back to a Mac.  Part 3 - Apple have released this incredible laptop called the MacBook Air. It&#39;s like an iPad without the disadvantages. Part 4 - Back to the MacBook Pro. How I miss the power of a professional laptop. Part 5 - I took my MacBook Pro to my wedding! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=604\">10:04</a> What???????It&#39;s the exact opposite for me.Downloading a bunch of apps only to delete them after a one-time use Please give me your remarkable tablet if you stop using it. I need it🙏 ok Waiting for jerry rig you may need to fire your editor for that toothbrush shot 😄 “You can also just hold down the command key to see all available functions within any app you’re using” Uhhh yeah, Arun acts like that is a new thing for the new Magic Keyboard when its been on the previous Magic Keyboard for iPad for the longest time now…as well as all those previous mac like feeling swiping gestures for the trackpad, nothing new here 😂😂 Hey Arun loved this video, but I think there is a minor issue in the lighting and I found it a bit dim I guess... Take a look there! <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE\"></a> Xiaomi Pad 6 had those features before apple, + it has more durability on Pen (Including pen having all those features) and it doesnt drop from pad even if u shake, and the price is around 370 Ads Isn’t the point of the remarkable tablet to have the perks of having a digital notebook anywhere you go without any of the distractions of your smartphone? Doesn’t getting an iPad go completely in the face of it? An ipad isnt meant to replace a computer or be a &quot;professional device&quot;its really a kids toy or something use to watch movie on the go or in bed paying more than $700+ is stupid its not a difficult decision apples ipad is locked down anyway APPLE Junk at an Insane price. Good if your Dad is a Billionaire. Why I just bought it? Because you can afford one. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=46\">0:46</a> 📸ayo I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE THEY ALREADY HAVE AN M4 IPAD BUT NOT EVEN AN M3 MAC MINO 1 tb  or 2 wOw ItS tHiNnEr STOP convincing me to spend another 1000-1500 🤣🤣 Which one did you get? Let’s be honest, you bought it for views! You didn’t buy it because it’s thin because at the end of the day, it’s a large iPhone. “Sometimes you want to sit in a coffee shop and brainstorm ideas?” You will do that once and go back to your laptop and iPhone. iPads are good for one thing; portable screen for your kids (car, doctors office, etc.) Me being kindof technical dissagree with so much. Like you not being able to download movies on a compiuter but on a ipad because one can pirate them. Like the simple option is to just pirate it. Also develop a app for Ipad, android, pc and mac or whatever is so much more effort than simply making a website. Why would somone also ever want to download a large app instead of temporary loading a webpage. I love as you watch sun in background gets lower and lower really cool nope still closed environment Mrwho: Phones are capable of multi tasking.<br>iPhone 2024: 🤐 Currently using iPad Pro M2 with pencil should I upgrade.?? 256gb with a external usb device is all I need &amp; I have stacks of 8tb drives all around. You’ll be fine with it, I use the native  files app bc it integrates with multiple services (Gdrive, OneDrive) I also use Panics Transmit app. I gave up the MacBook in 2018 bc now iPad &amp; my Mac Studio is all I need. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=10\">0:10</a> how is your laptop moving The table is shaking. @@Celixir ohhh Figma should create a worthy iPad os app……..until then the iPad is just a mini tv 😂.<br><br><br>Pls don’t say Figurative Already using an iPad instead of a Macbook for years and still not ran into issues. Also managing your files is easy with for example a Synology NAS. Would be cool of the bring Xcode to iPad, because that would make it mostly pro, on the dev side of things at least Calling it now that MacBooks only got one or two versions left! V12 Apple TV Damn my mom could play Candy Crush so hard on this badboy im watching dis on an ipad (not an m4 ofc but still) Apple is loosing touch with reality.... Honestly i plan on getting one but i am just waiting stress review OLED screen does the risk of burn in still exist and how gentle do you have to handle with how thin it is. I have the Samsung Galaxy tab S9 Ultra. They are 5.5mm thick, and it is on the border of being too thin. I really don&#39;t like the idea of a thinner tablet. I am not a fan of something that weighs as much as these large tablets having squard edges on the metal frame; a slight chamfer would be preferable for comfort.<br>Personally, I paid £1,600 and got the backlit Samsung keyboard and a pair of their ear buds as well as 12 months Disney+, all included in that initial payment. And it comes with the pen in the box.<br>I appreciate that the Ipad is more powerful, but I&#39;m not a graphics designer or anything that requires that power. My S9 Ultra is more than powerful enough for what I use it for, so much so that it now lives on the power saving battery mode because it is still more than fast enough. I can spend an entire saturday painting Warhammer miniatures, from 10am to 6pm with YouTube/Netflix/Audible on the tablet and I don&#39;t use more than 60% of the battery.<br>Plus, it has Dex.  <br><br>What is the battery life like on these new Ipads? With the dual layer OLED screen, I would imagine it hammers the battery because the device being so thin must surely limit the space for the battery? What the 12in MacBook should have been hearing him say 8tb laptop would i have to get icloud. meanwhile im like. i should rlly get an external drive to offload some of the 600gb of photos i have stored in icloud 300,512 in INR Apple products are overpriced pieces of crap. They charge whole $200 for 8 gigs of ram. For context you can get 2 corsair vengence DDR5 64GB RAM sticks for $154!!. The apple shit dont even last for 5 years, the repairs are crazy expensive, the purchase is crazy expensive and the only two specialized apps they offer is final cut pro and logic pro. In actuality Apple is DO*WATER and this guy is ranting about how amazing their products are. tbh why not just get a laptop? 😂 Most powerfull youtube player hahahaha, with so much power that you wouldn&#39;t use anyway This sounds like an ad. Good luck replacing your Mac with this. I&#39;m incredibly surprised a tech enthusiast like you thinks you are going to replace your laptop with this or that you are even surprised at what an Ipad does. I have some other words to use, but i think you are just lying to everyone here. The iPad offers &quot;just enough&quot; functionality to look like you are performing the same type of work as you would on a laptop (or a Mac) but not quite since, as you put it, Apple wants you to have both.<br><br>In essence, it all boils down to what do you want to use it for. As a web designer / developer, the iPad simply does not produce the kind of efficiency I derive from my MacBook Pro. That said, it&#39;s fantastic if I am on the go to work on copywriting or even researching. I probably won&#39;t get it but as I travel more, who knows. me watching this on my tablet that costed 120$ when i came out back in 2019 I can buy a nice car in my country with that...<br>Or<br>I can pay 100 Months of rent No joke (but 1 room tho)<br>with this...<br>and its gonna end up in hands of a kid watching cocomelon only appeling this is the OLED 120 hz screen 😂😂 I wanna be invited to your wedding Aron😢 I&#39;d rather have the same chassis and same size battery that lasts longer with the efficient M4 than a thinner iPad with a smaller battery with the same battery life. For almost four grand just get a 3000$ grand macbook, and an iPad air + apple pencil... <br>I&#39;m sorry, but owning an M1 iPad pro 12.9&quot; myself, just shows how little it can do. I can&#39;t do my school homework on this thing.<br>As others are saying it&#39;s going to be the fastest iPad!!! For watching netflix and taking notes. lol<br><br>If I somehow get over the pricetag, my M1 iPad gets really hot when using note taking apps, 3rd party or not. I would like to see a thermal camera pointed at this thing after hours of usage :) As someone who has never owned a tablet/ipad before, this review has given me a better perspective on the things that matter when buying one. Buy the Samsung. It&#39;s much better @@thewonderofyou1 gonna take a look at it 👀 The tab S9 FE can be a laptop if wanted I feel like this apple &quot;innovation&quot; is only to get more money out of consumers. Sure, game-changing if you like micro-transaction. I use an iPad everyday for work, it has power but there’s nothing to use that power other than the very specific apps they showcase, they really need to give it PC capabilities.<br>For some specific things ur gonna want to find workarounds, Google drive is basically useless. Whatever you gotta tell yourself.. Waiting for JerryRigEverything to do the durabillity test iPad Pros always make MacBooks seem like a good deal, can do more at a lower price NIce toothbrush !!! such a load of shit…. lmao . More useless than a phone that fits in your pocket and more useless than a gaming laptop, yet more expensive than both combined.<br>Let me guess, another 8 gigs would bump the price to 5k? iPad Pro M4 Hands on - Why I just bought it.<br>CONTENT iGlad was actually very good 😂😂😂 ipad pro has a very serious problem, with keyboard cover it is much heavier than macbook air but it is nowhere as a productivity device. I had thought I would draw and take notes a lot on it but in the end it is just collecting dust. Don&#39;t make the same mistake as I do 😭 Maybe Apple designed this so it could become a laptop replacement for content creators. That is free publicity for the ipad line which was otherwise dying. Most other people who use macbooks can&#39;t really replicate their workflows on ipad. <br><br>One last consideration: for children and teenagers, ipad sucks wet arse. It does not give them the freedom to explore all the opportunities computing has to offer. Imagine learning how to code your first mod for a game on an ipad. You can&#39;t. On PC not only can you get amazing games like Stalker GAMMA for free and legally, but also all the tools you need to star making your own mods. And then we have the thing that will really kill it: the excel mobile app sucks wet arse. Arun, this is not new to ipad, most of these commands already available on the previous ipad. I have the 2021 ipad pro and don&#39;t see a reason to upgrade. iPad OS is deliberately hamstrung by apple. Except for niche cases, I find it hard to justify a lot of the upgrades in apple That smart brush part was sus😂 sorry this is boring its just like an ad, bye. I don&#39;t really see the point how often do you really go out and edit a video or draw something or just watch YouTube where it can&#39;t wait until you come back home to your pc or your phone isn&#39;t enough No way bro uses an 8 terabyte laptop Issue is the same as with the &quot;old&quot; ones. I have an m1 ipad, so its already (still) quite powerfull. i love it, but for entertainment. I felt always to limited for the stuff i do. Especially when it comes to file system, adjusting different windows, having the look and feel of a real operating system, having the precision of a mouse or the touchpad, limits of ports for extra hardware - but also where the ports are located on the ipad. When they solve it with the new Keyboard, than it is still couple of others, which would bother me in daily life. Alos some software isn&#39;t just there yet, or available for mobile (phone) but is horrible on the ipad. The apple-angst that you would not buy an macbook kills the device on productivity terms. Apple didn&#39;t do enough for me to just a new one. Recommend you to watch Videos why people have return to macbooks on older ipad models and ask yourself are their CONs also important for you. Because on paper an ipad sounds like a great piece of tech. Just use a Samsung tab s9 ultra I&#39;m having so much trouble keeping up with technology. Stop pretending the iPad has become a PC replacement. It still has a mobile phone OS (with another name).<br><br>I have a Pro 2018 and it’s no different. Apple buyout him can&#39;t wait to see @jerryrigeverything bend it man made me feel poor bro really said ima 8 tb  guy and 2tb idk how to manage storage<br><br><br>i have 500gb on my laptop Dude I&#39;m buying a full-on RV that works and runs for 3K 😂😂😂 My 2018 iPad Pro died recently. The display stopped working. The backlight still works, just no display. I suspect it was because over the years, it got bent a little. I was waiting to order the new pro, but after seeing the 13&#39; is 5.1 mm , I decided to just get the 13&#39; iPad Air. I was really looking forward to the oled screen on the pro, but there&#39;s no way it doesn&#39;t get bent. And I have a M1 Max MacBook Pro for serious work. Less performance from what will be lowest end chip in the m4 lineup, much more expensive, but because it weighs all of a single kilogram less than a macbook pro, that&#39;s enough to justify buying one? I think Arun just wants new and shiny If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that Procreate is an amazing drawing tool, not to say Procreate Dreams to animate, I&#39;d never buy one of these... Marques on the other hand: I mean its alright, overrated as fuck in my opinion 😐🙄 i prefer websites over app, anytime. Light slowly reduced in your hotel room after the sun went down , It happens to me all the time when I use natural light and I have to increase ISO. I was the biggest critic when the ipad was first introduced. I just couldn&#39;t see the use of it. Fast forward to now, I&#39;m just about to go on a business trip, and i&#39;ve never been away from my ipad. It&#39;s gotten powerful enough to do a lot of misc work, and it&#39;s very portable when compared to a laptop. The battery is good (better than laptop) and the screen is amazing. It is my daily driver and it goes with me everywhere. I&#39;ve questioned about getting a 13&quot; since it feels unwieldy but with the light weight M4 i may need to reconsider. <br><br>On the battery topic, even if it has 2 OLED panels, the battery may be the same because OLED is extremely power efficient, since it&#39;s capable of shutting off individual pixels to save energy, where as LCD cannot, and that could translate to why battery life is still equivalent to the old model. It&#39;s also why the contrast is also much better as black is true black. hows life as a tiktok influencer? build a home that can survive without electricity from the grid. there is a Carrington event in our near future. 2025-2035 Here’s the reason iPad will NEVER replace my MacBook. MUSIC. As in Proper music - CD ripping so I have good quality and not streaming crap. My own collection of 500GB worth on my MacBook which I sync to my iPhone, iPad and IPod classic in the car. The IPad won’t be able to do that because Apple haven’t given a shit about iTunes and proper music collections as they want to push everyone to pay for casual streaming. Which I refuse to do. Until Apple actually give credence to those of us who put them where they are - as in music collectors, then iPad will never replace the mac. They removed the ultra wide camera and 3 studio quality mics. Like wtf? My issues with tech reviews these days is that they are biased if APPLE releases a tablet it get its own review reponse but if it is samsung or other tech companies they do not make this much effort i have no idea if its because APPLE is more appealing or what but to be honest they far better tablets then this but these top tech reviewers will never review at all and its just not Mrwhosetheboss mostly Marques as a tech fan I am highly disappointed in you guys recently feel like APPLE has bought to review their products using you guys as their bridge to marketing It&#39;s funny that your conclusion was towards the laptop over the tablet, because I was the opposite. I hated having a laptop when a tablet does everything. aayee yoooo Double check the price The squeeze comes from galaxy pens 🤣 I dont&#39; agree at all with Arun paying 3600 USD is crazy , may be he needs a wedding gift from Apple :) Cringe hyper consumerism What the hell happened to you building the biggest iPhone challenge man i hate apple why am i even here Wow, This is the worst review of your channel now. Imagine justifying a 3000+ dollar tablet and how thought-provoking it is lmao Sellout. Obsene amount for tablets!!!!!.....but people will go to obsene lenghts to buy new ipads as usual. My laptop that can run Forza Horizon 5 and RDR2 was $1200CAD😅, also no Unreal Engine on it is a deal breaker lol. Waste of money When you can afford it any device can become worth it lol, cause shit if why would anyone think twice about a small minute feature or con when they can afford it. Yeah but, the Magic Keyboard im currently using (V1 I assume) does exactly the same thing??? Like… what?? I actually wish the released a physical ruler that is compatible with the ipad. That would’ve been better. And why is it just with this iPad that you say it can replace your laptop? What do these new iPads do compared to the previous 2-3 generations? I&#39;ll tell you, absolutely nothing because iPad OS nerfs any hardware Oh no it’s gonna snap My car is worth less xd THEY STILL DIDNT CHANGE THE APPLE PEN TIP AND ITS LIKE AN ICE PICK SAMSUNGS IS SMOOTH AS BUTTER AND OFC THEY ACTUALLY INCLUDE THE PEN iPad OS ... sucks ... don&#39;t ever think it will replace your Laptop. Because I bought and iPad Pro about four years ago for that. all the iPad OS releases later it hasn&#39;t changed. At the end you go back to the macOS because it actually lets you do things. Just remember. We still do not have dynamic albums in Photos on iPad OS. We do not have multiple accounts. and so on ... Just to let you know, guys, the Apple service center does not repair iPads once they are out of the warranty period. If something happens to your iPad after the warranty has expired, you will need to either buy a new one or get it repaired at your local repair shop. We have a few tablets, at one time we used them as a more portable laptop. I liked the larger screen. All that being said we really never use them anymore.  I turn mine on once in a while so it backs up my information but that&#39;s it.  Some games are better on the tablet but not so much better that I actually get up and go get the tablet.  Heck I hardly ever use my laptop at this point, maybe once a month when I pay bills. this was just a 16 minute ad only 400k subs left btw him and apple<br>MEGAA IPHONEE true i feel that apps are better than websites... but the problems are sometimes apps are poorly optimized to the point where i wonder if a website would have been much faster at doing the same thing an app could do... this is minus the apps that are properly designed and made for their proper purpose... sometimes i feel people rely on apps too much... and i prefer somethings the old fashion way because it would be more efficient... hflee thousand I&#39;m definitely getting the 13inch I padpro. I was waiting for over a year for them to release one I felt was worth it. This will be my 1st Ipad. Very excited Well I was in the exact same position as you when I was about to buy an iPad but I stopped my self and gave myself 2 weeks to really think about getting an iPad . Glad I didn’t because I don’t really have any use for it but people have different preferences and needs. Love your videos arun❤ its actually 999$ He&#39;s just coping on his purchase at this point 😂 My iPad Pro 12.9 has been in the drawer for many months. The multitasking on the ipad is a juke. I have an Android tablet, Galaxy Tab 7+, for media consumption as the 16x9 aspect ratio is best for me.  My wife uses Ipad pro for teaching and note talking. The pencil is the most important deiver for usibg an IPad. If you do not need the pencil, the ipad is of no use for pro users.  For work, just get a computer (Mac, of course). I think Apple will never allow IpadOS to be a MacOS Equivilant as they want to keep those two products as seperated as they can to make make as much money as they can. They would lose too money if people only bought Ipads that could do everything a macbook can. I use a 2012 Samsung galaxy note 10.1 tab in grey I still use for drawings yooo man its actually similar to the thickness of my laptop screen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=615\">10:15</a> I really hate being asked to download an app, I don&#39;t want to have hundreds of apps for things I&#39;ve only used once or twice. There is always something missing in ipad OS. It is not MacOS. Period. Been there. At the end of the day you regret spending so much money on a &quot;professional&quot; device with so many limitations. Feels like vw beetle with a twin turbo v8 That fully specced out IPad would cost at least $5,000 AUD in Australia. New iPads are OK, but what I really love is this sweatshirt! Does anyone know what brand it is? I can&#39;t wait for jerryrigeverything to bully this device😂 i am sad seeing u review the ipad this way i feel they payed u bro the ipad isnt thay good bro mac is better <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> Bratha EWWWW I&#39;ll stick with (heresy ensues) my Microsoft Surface Pro - best of both worlds. Fully functional laptop / tablet / everything. The amount of storage you get on the iPad pro is a rip off it only comes with 256MB starting it should start with 1TB and go up from there.  This is a pro device with such small storage when storage has only gotten better without a price hike over the past decade and Apple is still screwing us.  Getting a iCloud solution is not an option either to pay for storage on a subscription suck and if I want my files ready and available at all times and want to edit them on my device and if the files get too large you will constantly be swapping things from the cloud to the device.<br><br>  Everyone has the same attitude it sucks but I got to buy it get a spine stop buying things that need to get with the future. Balls Madness at that price this guy just came here to talk up the iPad. man all this talk cos you feel like you an write on the iPad. lol Yo… relax with that toothbrush Seems like I&#39;m watching more of a advertisement of ipad, lol. Because thats what it is, he sold out again to Apple. i wish they still made the simpler phones like they used to. i do not need or want a modern smartphone Light-field handheld XR tablet will be the ultimate. You are in for a rude awakening. Ipad os will block you here and there in your workflow If you actually need speed, precision and consistency you will use a separate mouse instead of a trackpad or a touchscreen. If you barely use anything that requires a cursor then those are fine. A pencil can work as a comparable substitute, but it&#39;s not ideal for everything. Lol this doesn&#39;t replace a laptop. It is a laptop. but now you need to buy your keyboard separately, and a new &quot;magic&quot; penicil to use the touchscreen properly. Apple are top tier a convincing idiots that innovation is removing functionality. The website metions all day battery life 😋 Instead of buying and making iPads and ipencil or whatever the f its called more and more like paper and pencil, here’s a crazy idea….wait for the drumroll, WHY NOT USE A FREAKING PAPER AND PENCIL ? Crazy idea right? I know. i personally will stick to 300€ laptops and 100€ phones. (and never upgrade hardware until it breaks beyond repair) Yes, it is technically the most powerful tablet, but comparing price-preformance with the galaxy S9 tablets, why would anyone pay that much money for a tablet? How is it worth it? Or is this really just apple having a mental grip on it&#39;s users? So a 14&quot; MacBook Pro costs $100 less than a base model iPad Pro 13&quot; + keyboard..... Yet the MBP has USB ports, thunderbolt, HDMI, SD reader, headphone jack, fast charging.. OH and it also has more RAM, double the storage, runs a full OS. Why the f would you even consider an iPad. Useless. Can&#39;t run legacy computer software (like medical electronic records) without support and these Medical EHR companies could care less so we are stuck with laptops and desktops.. please put MacOS on them .. that is what is holding up their progress Do a review of pixel 8a He&#39;s officially joined the team as an Apple sales representative! 🤣 If you were reviewing a pickup truck, would you complain because you have 2 kids and a wife to drive around and a truck with a bed in the back is dumb. I would never use it. I just don&#39;t see the point of having a bed in the back of the truck. If I compare it to a Honda Civic, the Honda makes more sense. Or, are they different vehicles for different purposes? The ipad is useless. It&#39;s a niche product, and people who bought them are trying to justify their purchase. Damn you throated that toothbrush Currently watching this on my first-gen iPad Pro that I’ve used in lieu of a proper computer since 2019 😂 I will join the club when the ipad can actually run Mac OS and ipad OS <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=3\">0:03</a> HAKKI ABİİİİİİ So apple just released their version of the MS surface pro... well actually thats very Apple. Please can I have your Macbook when you replace it with the iPad? My wish for the year😍. Thank you With these amazing iPads they better add some awesome software since they can’t run desktop applications I am holding out for the updated Mini. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=44\">0:44</a> looks suspicious I’m betting my life that there’s already gonna be iPad Pro bending tests It’s the same issue with EVERY new iPad release in the last 4/5 years. For a device to be ‘Pro’ we need to be able to freely install programs that are specific to our use case. The longer we’re limited to the App Store the longer this is basically a giant iPhone. <br>Being thinner and having additional performance isn’t of interest to ‘pros’ as it literally can’t be utilised. iPad sales are dropping because consumers aren’t been listened too.<br>If you own an M1 iPad what’s the point in upgrading when the specs bumps are barley utilised due to software limitations 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️ I love my iPad Air for college, but I will NEVER use a Mac because my Microsoft laptop is more powerful and a bit more intuitive with the software that I have to use. iPad for notes, laptop for everything else These iPads are actually so sick <br>I’ve always wanted one for school or art, its like a pseudo-laptop phone Ah following the MrBeast sudden video ending strat. Smart. Annoying but smart lmao DO IT!!! The M4 chip is 20% faster than the M3 chip. You make allot of good points about app integration and design. It does seem like developers think about the apps first over the website! Especially with smart home technology! This is just a video of him convincing himself. Why he should buy the ipad wish they just kept the width but got rid of the camera bump So much copium, This video was just mrwhostheboss justifying dropping stupid money for a tablet Dude has money, watch the video and give him more I have an m1 ipad pro 11&quot; and it&#39;s got terrible battery life and always has.  Funny how Apple says literally nothing about battery improvements over the years because there are none. I have fallen on this hype so many times and ended up using my Mac for everyday use and having an ultra-powerful M2 iPad for watching Amazon video and Youtube.  Not again.....  Interesting video though. iGlad just sounds wrong 😂😂😂 Night is falling during shooting 😀 Sponsored by apple Bro said “why I just bought it” as a title.. How are people still putting up with these semi-professional marketers.. Imma be honest, buying an iPad now as anyone else but an artist swearing on Procreate is stupid. Sorry. It&#39;s true. It will be interesting to see if they update iPad os at the summer event Errrr regards storage, have you not ever considered a nas drive? They literally just need to enable cursor use with a mouse for precision and better compatibility with more&quot;pro&quot; stuff. Than the ipad would attend almost everyone. For the first time I thought I would see in ending: this video was directed by apple, edited on ipad Watching this on my 5.7mm 580gr 12.4&quot; Galaxy Tab S9+ 512GB + 1TB Microsd First take from a serious and thoughtful gadget reviewer about using the iPad as an all-in-one device that replaces the macbook as well. Brilliant. Can’t wait to hear more about the journey and also what’s cooking in the AI department at WWDC. Boooo, Apple boooo. I recently got the previous gen iPad Pro 10.9 inch, 1TB, and it feels good enough to where I don’t need a laptop. I prefer an iPad over a laptop simply because of the versatility that a laptop does not have. Laptops require a keyboard while an iPad can rest comfortably almost anywhere if the case as a little stand on it. I can be lazy in bed in multiple positions while still doing productive things on my iPad, where as with a laptop I need to always be upright. For the amount of versatility I get, I can trade a little functionality, which is exactly what the iPad is. So you wanna work from your bed?? you might just end up like the humans in Wall-e 😂😂😂 I completely agree. Versatility is what a laptop or even a macbook has just for the OS , if your job is just checking emails and basic web browsing then you really don&#39;t need the latest tech for that. It really depends on what work you do. Watching videos, some Excel or basic work that can be done on phone, can be done on iPad too. But not every pc work can be done on ipad Same here @@JishinimaTidehoshi well, it can certainly be a plus to be lazy every once in a while, it’s more than just an excuse to stay in bed lol Why they have downgraded the camera?? Almost everything he says about the new one applies to the prior one too. I have tried to use the Ipad as a MacBook replacement but had failed time and again. So I&#39;ve kind of given up hope on the IPad I am exited for ip68 and Qi2 i. iPad<br>Do we have in new ipad pro 😅 JerryRig : wow its a foldable ipad 💀 Mmmm… have you ever used a PC? It would do everything a Mac (or an iPad) does without the limitations you’re mentioning. At half the price. How could this slimmest fanless body handles the heat of extremely powerful M4 with 1600 nits brightness.<br>iPhone pro <br>And MacBook air can&#39;t.<br>😂 I spent $2900 on my last car used. Apple scares me. Of course casual youtube content creators can replace their computers with an iPad easily. Software engineers like myself cannot replace their macs with a silly toy like the iPad equipped with glorified iOS. Thank you. If an iPad can easily replace your mac, then you didn&#39;t need a mac in the first place. Not worth the upgrade in fact not even an upgrade. People save ur money use it on something better like a vacation. Let it hurt Tim Cooks pockets he has never been innovative all about profits. &quot;Netflix is better on this platform because the latter is so restrictive&quot; is an L-take that will not have me switch to that platform anytime soon! Wow! I shocked when I heard the price. That&#39;s why Apple revenue getting drop because of the price of their products getting higher and higher and get less. i&#39;m good with what i have. New iPads are a boon for Graphics Designers, Digital Artists and Animators 😊 shockingly like 2 year old Samsung: but still lacking Replace your laptop? Rally? Why now? This doesn’t do anything more laptop than the old one, its just nicer. Nothing about this more productive than that last model. The weight of the iPad has been reduced to work better with the new Magic Keyboard.  The old design made the iPad and keyboard combo feel top heavy. That won’t be the case now. If Apple didn’t tell you there was any difference, you would not even notice a single difference between the old iPad Pro and this new one. Also, 99% of people do not need the pencil squeezing technology. The problem with the iPad is thus: it has almost laptop capable hardwear, but uses tablet softwear. Something about this guy makes me love watching his channel<br><br>The urge to buy this  and never use a laptop again 🫠 The only reviewer that is not shooting Apple directly in the heart 😁 Imagine spending all that money right now  for it to be cheaper  after few months🤣🤣 Tell me one thing this generation can do that my 2021 M1 version cant 3600 dollars for a proper high end tablet, is enough to get you a very well, even higher spec Mac, phone, and other tablet. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=141\">2:21</a> chj, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=841\">14:01</a> Happy advance marriage life Arun 🎉 You cannot convince me this thing has more power than a Mac but doesn’t require a cooling fan Okay Arun, when you say “damn” it doesn’t mean the same thing. The problem with iPad pro is not with power or screen size is the os. I use my tablet to watch youtube when my phone is dying lol Why? What&#39;s the obsession with THINNER devices? As an influential tech reviewer, can you not hold Apple accountable instead for majority customer feedback where people ask for longer battery life and more durability for the Pro models? Honestly, happy with my 10.9 IPad from 2022, see you in 2026/27 for a true upgrade. I think that all those new iPads are overpowered for what&#39;s actually possible to do with those devices. I&#39;ve been making music on my Air from 2020, edit videos directly from SSD while have lots of apps opened at the same time. What I want to say is that you want to pay a price of a small car to do what you can already do for the 1/3 of the price with older devices... :D iPad will NEVER be a computer. iOS is still an inferior OS. It is not Mac, and it is not Windows. With stretched iPhone apps that shows exactly the same amount of content no matter the screen size Bro had to make a entire video to give himself a shred of validation before spending 3k on a ipad Next thing they gonna make Apple Pencil air💀 The new camera position makes the video feel way more personal. Like it’s a friend that’s turned away from his table to talk to you. I hope this comment helps <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Aye <b>YOOOO!!!</b> Pause bro, PAUSE!🙅🏾\\u200d♂️🤣🤣🤣💀💀 Arun trying to sell the iPad Pro strongly in this one. Question mister Arun: behind you is it a real scene or a green screen? The reflection in the window tells me it&#39;s real, but the quality of the image screams high-end green screen. It&#39;s beautiful and disturbing at the same time😅 Enjoy your videos, but nothing you&#39;ve said justifies spending almost $3,000 on an overpriced iPad instead of a MacBook Pro, or a Lenovo Legion Pro. I just realized your primary phone is s24 ultra. 😂 Eh. It&#39;s an overpriced Apple product with limited function. Usually love your reviews and the editing is top notch as always, but I feel like this is completely tone deaf- spending 3600 bucks on a tablet that is so so limited in functionality to a traditional PC, saying that &quot;the only thing PCs have over mobile operating systems is the filesystem&quot; etc.. just seems like you haven&#39;t really used a computer before. You need the  1tb or 2tb to get the new screen. He&#39;s actually convincing himself to buying one lol... Waiting for Samsung to drop their thin version now. Would never get apple products. Can&#39;t even game on those mac books. how the hell did you get that Good for you, I think the new iPads suit your needs and it would definitely worth for you to purchase one. However, when we think about majority of the users, most will never use the pro apps and the spec bump is absolutely useless for them. The main thing that needs change is iPadOS because why do we have that much power if most can&#39;t even use it? Slap macOS on it and it would absolutely sell. Even if the samsung tab s9 ultra is very weak compared this, I would take it any day if I don&#39;t have workload that REALLY requires pro iPad apps(Android has good selection of pro apps too) I think you made this video to convince yourself to pay £3K for a tablet. 😂 Don’t do it!!!!<br>- you got the remarkable to be less app distracted <br>- so many iPhone apps do not have iPad parody <br>- So many Mac apps have a dork iPad version <br>- using FCPX on iPad is like the guy who’s trying to eat a 3 course meal from the middle seat in economy class.<br><br>I foresee a regret video in your future. If the pro is so thin, there&#39;s like no point in buying an air since the pro is thinner anyway. The only difference is the price. But at that point, wouldn&#39;t you just buy a normal iPad? Since the air and normal have like the same specs now😭🙏 I disagree with your take on tablets being the end goal over laptops, but I do think that you are correct in saying that more portable devices with touch and nice build quality are the way to go. Most people probably don’t need a keyboard with the effectiveness of swipe typing, voice, gestures, and app design. I do wish Apple would allow macOS/UNIX type OS to run on the higher end iPads. Did he moved somewhere? The studio is different. Man, you should have watched MKBHDs video first about the new ipads :P <br>before making that purchase <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/8gF1Xp_zK8jk8gSDrI2wCw\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=743\">12:23</a> Trypophobia trigger warning ⚠️ Yum Why🫤😭😭 fake ah&#39; phobia @@uhuuehu7863 Nahh Huawei tablet more better from design and thin “Not dark yet, but it’s getting there.” I’m rarely early why not get a pc If apple survives with what they are doing,  people of the planet earth  are really dumb. And it&#39;s still runing iPad OS, still can&#39;t to doing &quot;Pro things&quot; on it. <br>Obsidian, Heptabase.. many app are running better on MacOS. An updated iPad mini with a keyboard like this will probably get my money ngl Soo.. when do we get an Ipad with a great screen and battery, but thin and equipped with a phone chip for a lower price I wonder why they keep insisting on thinner I’d thicker and more battery over thinner I’m a year 11 high school student in Australia, rn I’m doing majority of the top subjects I can be doing so it’s pretty intense study and all that. We use devices at school, I have the smaller iPad Pro and have had it for 3 years. Our school recommended we get MacBooks when we get to year 10 because the work load if a lot more, and I’ve started to see why. Would you (anyone reading this) recommend I get this IPad, a MacBook or anything else? Or even just to stick with what I have now. I’ve discussed with my parents and they’re willing to help me pay for a MacBook but if I were to get this iPad I would have to save for a bit longer. So yeh, what would yous recommend? Not excited at all... Bagus itu saya suka💕👍 I can buy a used iMac m1 for cheaper lol TBH, my iPad Pro 1gen. would like to know if there is actually anything new or interesting on new iPad Pros?<br>I get the speed and the screen, but other than that, my 9-year-old experience with iOS/iPadOS and its &quot;evolution&quot; puts it in the category - why even bother.<br>I mean, buy a device with notion of software getting better overtime? That does not seem right, and is often rightfully criticized on other products. one camera on the back Consumerism won’t make you happy Bro &quot;We stayed up till 6.40am to get this video done, please watch lol&quot;<br>I really love your video, but make sure to stick to your 11pm bedtime! Wait 2 years and it will be 50 quid yeah but ...ITS IS NOT OSX....is absurd to buy a and absurd to exist a piece of tech so advanced jet with a castrated operating system..... Don&#39;t understand why iPads are compared to laptops. iPads are a different type of device which have touch screens. It&#39;s a different use case. I personally love the tactile experience of a tablet. Great device. Good job Apple. So basically they copied s8 ultra from 3 years ago and aaded some new stuff to it and tripled the price iPad is so expensive he has to make two videos to afford it. One to talk about buying it and all it can do and one where he actually has it and says it’s great but not amazing. The file storage system on ipadOS is super annoying. My work around was storing all my files on Google Drive and it was a painful experience trying to save and open files on my tablet. It&#39;s a strange place for Apple to have a ton of friction, everything else is superior to a laptop. Best mainstream tech  guy ever You escaped the bullshiting We all just Witnessed the down fall of Apple How much are Youtubers going to try to push users to buy overpriced tech that is hardly upgraded from previous generation and usecase for tablet remains watching streaming content. In no world is paying 3600 USD justified for tablet. Even if a youtuber tries to sell with 16 mins of video !! PCMR <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=375\">6:15</a> this is literally just false, the apple pencil (2nd generation) had both the rotational functionality and a touch-based button on the side I bought an iPad and a keyboard case thinking it could replace my laptop. Look story short, it didn’t. iPad OS sucks his comment near the end kinda irks me, cause back when i did tech support that misconception was annoyingly common, and it seems it&#39;s still lingering around...<br>iCloud is NOT additional storage space on iphone/ipad and no apple-made mobile app can use it that way. it can only be used as backup space for the most part. If you are an Illustrator, artist, like me, this small changes are huge, specially talking about the Pencil PRO. With a display, make it amazing. But really?? spending 3.6k on a tablet (let&#39;s not kid ourselves, that&#39;s what an iPad really is) when you could buy a decent windows laptop (which would probably have an equal if not better performance) and a phone for that total price is quite redundant. It does have it&#39;s place in a niche of someone like for you but that&#39;s the same niche for the Xperia phones. Yes they&#39;re great but would the normal person require that, no. That being said the sheep are still going to buy this piece of hardware they won&#39;t even use 1% of and tout it as the best purchase ever. That&#39;s what pisses me off, like I can afford it but do I want to buy it, no. wait what happened to i make a phone if we overtake apple youtube channel ? I find that I really have very little use for laptops and iPads though. I have desktops everywhere and their 32&quot; screens make anything smaller seem frustrating. But our family has almost a dozen iPads. The kids live on them and never watch TV. Samsung tab s9 ultra is better This iPad Pro will be my first iPad. Got the 13 inch. I am definitely hyped. I love your channel but think you are off on this video? I love Apple and all their products but right now, I have imessage, signal, todos, firefox and watching your video in a window on my mac.  Can I do that on the ipad yet? No... and I think that is what you are missing which is so strange.  Still love ya but this video was way off.  To prove my point, lock your laptop up for a week and only use the ipad.  Within 24 hours you will realize its not a replacement yet.  Now that would be a great video to see you do. It’s feel like apple innovate nothing but only increases price that’s it Me watching this realising i will probabily wont get it:Hmm interesting Arun you are a tech legend You are wrong in replacing your laptop if you are a Power User. IPAD&#39;s are useless for power users/tinkers.  Great for artists, gamers (and still very limited) and too much for office users. Even the macbook is getting on my nerve with all the Apple co. limitations they impose. Every OS update Apple pushes kills further apps we use for years because Apple doesn&#39;t support legacy software. And they make it difficult to install converters, emulators, etc... Even Windows emulation on Parallels doesn&#39;t run all programs you&#39;d expect on an actual Windows machine. I cringe every time someone talks about replacing their laptop with a tablet (what Apple wants). The day Apple makes a notebook become iPad OS then its the day I leave Apple for good. Still like my S9 ultra Apple said: Your next computer is not a computer. Still..not a computer with ipad OS 😅 this is for now just a really high end thing but i am very excited for when this advanced tablet tech becomes less expensive and more widely spread with more low end devices with similar uses as well! ive been using a surface pro 9 for a few days now and ive fallen in love with the uses and mobility. though in general i would wait for a tablet running on android just for the software freedom that ios doesnt have. Kill iPadOS!!! Or add macOS i still havent used my M1 ipad for anything else than meetings and youtube videos. The M4 is nice but useless in this form factor. Even the M1 is overkill for what its being used by most people. 🎶 Never gonna switch to iPad, never gonna let my MacBook down This video is basically and ad. That is not what I was expecting from you... Pure disappointment. Samsung Tablet incoming. Will it bend @JerryRigEverything ?! Watching from Xiaomi Pad 6 😂😂😂 Please retire the puns 😭 Until the ipad supports multiple user logins, it ain&#39;t a pc, and worse, it&#39;s a security risk. I like the lighting change when moving from daylight to night.  Good continuity. Arun&#39;s videos had became so good that words can&#39;t describe😊😊😊. Respect 🥰🥰🥰 Literally me watching his video though I can&#39;t afford...his speaking and reviews makes me want to watch him 😆 Yeah i dont use CR-apple products not worth it ! Hi 👋🏻 Is this a wedding invite for your 18.5 mil subscribers?? Crazy that an iPad is faster than my brand new iMac lol Could you review the samsung galaxy tab s9 Apple destroys samsung in the tablet market <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=947\">15:47</a> bro the iPad 8th gen that I’m using rn (which is great btw) has 32 GBS of storage I didn’t even know 8TB was a thing 😂 The iPad OS is limited compared to MacOS. Replacing your laptop with the iPad it would be stupid. Lol. I just need to know how my 4K HDR / UHD media will run on it He is conflicted What i only hate about ipads is the GB for its price. Feels like video is shot on phone Samsung better stepup thier game with thier next tab they better use the new snapdragon new PC chip that smart toothbrush scene caught me off-guard hahaha damn near choked on my coffee!! I have that toothbrush and it&#39;s not really that smart. It recognizes when you&#39;re applying too much pressure to your teeth but that&#39;s it. Everything else is poorly optimized. You don’t know about the oral b IO line up? Can I have your MacBook then please? 😂 Laptop &gt; Tablet did u mean harmonyOs from Huawei Screen made by Samsung 😂😂 None of these products, laptop, tablets etc are supposed to replace the other. They supplement based on what you are doing. A tablet with a keyboard will not really replace a laptop full time. A laptop will not replace a tablet full time. Example, when you are lying in bed and don&#39;t want the glare of a big TV before sleeping, you would rather use a tablet to watch media before going to sleep. You don&#39;t need a keyboard of mouse for that use. Another usage is when you are wanting to watch your content on a flight. Laptop is when you want to do some serious work.. either on a desk or even on your bed and especially when you want to type more. They all have their place.  There is no point in even discussing how one can replace the other. im broke 🤣 I’m the opposite of your intro. I used to never think a tablet was necessary since i had a MacBook, but the laptop has typical laptop issues. For example: for years it keeps telling me i have no memory space when theres like nothing stored on it. Ipads are more portable and can do everything a MacBook can do. Now I rarely open my MacBook. Ipad is from 2018 so I’ll trade it in and upgrade. It’s 2600 hundred in the USA if you get the highest spec with the 350 keyboard and the Apple Pencil pro and 2700 if you include coating still expensive but not 3600 hundred expensive (iPad only 2tb is 2300) Point is the prices in the uk when converted to dollars is crazy 😂 You&#39;re coming up with wayyyy too many excuses for this pointless iPad Os device it&#39;s ridiculous. Just get an older cheaper iPad if you want and you&#39;ll still be good. No need to waste money on an over kill social media device. &quot;Why I just bought it&quot; in case you don&#39;t wanna watch the whole vid.<br>- expects the iPad to be thin (why expect when he&#39;s already had a hands on?)<br>- one all replacement for his Mac and e-ink tablet (*doubt*)<br>- Magic Keyboard (using it is similar to a Mac, solid hinge, trackpad still not as big as Mac, not backward compatible with older Pro)<br>- Apple Pencil Pro (fiddly, pairing issues, new features - vibration motor, FindMy)<br>- M4 (not massive jump from M3, should have benchmark in full review)<br>- iPad can do some things better than a Mac because apps are better.<br>- Ultra Retina XDR (OLED)<br>- battery (not mentioned in keynote so he wants to test it)<br>- camera (proper placement this time)<br>- Stage Manager (pretty sure previous iPads have this..? yet he&#39;s excited about this)<br>- storage (mentions he&#39;s an 8tb Mac guy, iPad stops at 2tb. questions if he needs external drives or iCloud. for this reason alone, the iPad will never be his day to day)<br><br>There you have it. In short; he wants to test and review it. Once the full review comes in expect more or less the same content plus some fancy B-rolls. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> pause So... What I get from this video... MacBook sucks... Apple marketing is still the same pile of bull as always... So is their greed, because they are forcing you to get new accessories... Yeah, thanks for the video, I was actually contemplating getting a higher performance tablet for work (not editing videos) and now I know it definitely won&#39;t be this one :D Why he just bought it? Because he has a  lot more money than me Okay. These prices are stupid. People just keep paying these stupid prices and as long as people keep paying, they will keep raising the prices. This economy is doomed. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=524\">8:44</a>. WHY DOES SOMEONE HAVE AN ANDROID IN AN APPLE SHOWROOM. (No hate, i use android instead of apple, but still) The fact that a tablet compares to laptops is a jump forward Man with all this power wish you code on it :0 When a product tells me to use their app 🤮 People in Congo are dying for this. It&#39;s not worth it. Also, no one can afford this in this economy. Bro made an essay just for him to justify a meaningless purchase. Bro, we over here in Bidens economy. We can&#39;t afford those. I cant wait for Jerry Rig Everything reviews for this device..🙂 My 2018 iPad just gave out (after accidentally spilling soda in the charging port) not even 7 days ago so I’m excited to upgrade but I am so overwhelmed with trying to find what’s best for my needs 😩 A review for fellow Youtubers Just get a cheap iPad and everything what he said will still work on that cheap device, don&#39;t even bother spending 5 times the amount just to be able to do the same thing that you can on a device 5 times cheaper then it. And with the spare money, Get an actual Mac laptop and do all your mac os tasks there. No need to buy a device ridiculously expensive just to browse and view social media.... or better yet, Save your money and forget what the guy in the video says, he&#39;s got plenty of money to burn. 12,000 dhs is crazy This is the dumbest single video of mrwhosetheboss; <br>Pls Mr you can&#39;t replace the laptop because in iPadOS Lightroom is cut down version, photoshop, davinci resolve is super cut down version; <br>And you can&#39;t even resolve theoretical power of M4; Gluck gluck ‘n’ that toothbrush mate. Icant wait until you overtake Apple in subscribers. I absolutely loved the background with the sun setting. Just another reason to love the videos 🌇 Now compare this with the Xiaomi Pad 7 pro value wise when it comes out Thank you Apple. Now I admire my decision of buying the Samsung Tab S9 because it really is perfect for me ❤ like laptops with detachable keyboard have never existed :D Watching this on my 3 year old Samsung tablet with OLED and 5mm thick.

If you want Laptop, Tablet and Smartphone in one device, just use Samsung DEX. 👍 Here at 39k likes🎉 No, we don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying, because we are NOT on the same page as you at all. It&#39;s an iPad, you just called out such a minute scale of applicable apps to your basic daily checks as just usable, and anything more advanced is still not comparable to the actual laptop at all because iPad os is not Mac os.. until Apple decides to merge the 2 it is not worth getting an expensive social media browsing device at all. And they will not merge ipad and mac os completely because that would eat away and annihilate their profits from their laptop sales, so why would they .. even though they can due the identical internal chips and hardware that can run arm apps etc, They won&#39;t. That’s why MKBHD said yeah it’s nice that they made it thinner and a great chip but at its core it’s still just an iPad and expensive bigger phone smh This entire video is extremely biased.

Just becasue you don&#39;t see the purpose doesn&#39;t mean it has no merit. I would say that iPad is stagnating and Apple really needs to get the software to compete with Windows, Mac, and Linux in terms of power user tools.

I spent 1500 on an ipad pro with a keyboard case and apple pencil, and while it is very nice and I really like it, if given the opportunity to buy it again for that price I wouldn&#39;t.

Again compared to Samsung S series Tablets the Ipad is too expensive, slightly better and a trap to get into the Apple ecosystem. It&#39;s obviously 100% overpriced, but Arun just goes on thinking that everyone has 3600$ to spend on a Tablet, and he doesn&#39;t compare it to Samsung or the competition.

As a professional chemist and chemical engineer, iPad is a essential tool I use daily for work and for fun. My old iPad Pro was in use for 6 years and it still works great. Paying 3000+ for a device that I’ll use everyday for the next decade is more than worth it! \\u200b@@isolatedtrader5482and when you realize that option c is actually option a 🗿 @@grantschilb8019 typical apple glazer Exactly. I’m glad someone said it. People like me won’t even look up the newest iPad because we know there’s no way we can afford something so frivolous and honestly, pointless. I bought into many of the same arguments when I tried to replace my laptop with an iPad Pro M2 and honestly unless you are very dedicated to adapting your workflow to the iPad, it’s not as good of an experience as a Mac. With the exception of drawing with the Pencil, which is clearly superior on the iPad, the Mac is more versatile and powerful. The limitations of iPadOS are more significant than you might expect. Those apps that look so optimized often lack features that the Mac version has, and even if they have feature parity accomplishing tasks often takes extra steps. <br><br>I’ll give an example. I use Asana at work for project management. In Asana you can tag other users by typing “@“ and the first few letters of their name. You then get a dropdown menu and on Mac you just use the arrow keys and hit enter to select the person you want. On the iPad, you have to use the touch interface to interact with the dropdown menu which means you start the interaction on the keyboard and then have to take your hands off the keyboard to use either the touchscreen directly or the mouse, both of which are less efficient and intuitive. That’s just one small example but there are a million little things like this that add up to a lot of frustration over time. <br><br>That’s before you even get into things like external monitors where iPad also has more limitations than Mac, file management is more limited, device integration is more limited. You can’t use the amazing Universal Control feature without a Mac, period. Even though when Universal Control is activated you can use the iPad Magic Keyboard and mouse to control a Mac, you can’t initiate Universal Control with only an iPad. iPadOS is still treated like a junior OS which is mind boggling given the level of power the iPad pros have in them. <br><br>I also don’t see the iPad Pro as a good replacement for the remarkable tablet. It may be thinner and lighter but the price difference is massive and one of the benefits of the remarkable tablet is that you can focus on your writing/drawing with no distractions, whereas the iPad is fully integrated into your Apple ecosystem and unless you go out of you way to shut off notifications and other connections you’ll frequently be pulled out of your focus state by intrusions. <br><br>Personally I think the 13” Air is a much better buy. You get the same level of performance despite being two chip generations apart because iPadOS is so limited it can’t push the M1 to its full potential let alone the M2, you get a nice big screen that can work with the new Apple Pencil and you save a buttload of money. Or buy a used M1 or M2 iPad Pro, also save a buttload of money, and still get the nice extra features like promotion displays etc. Unless Apple announces a significant overhaul of iPadOS at WWDC that specifically takes advantage of the M4 chip, there is very little reason to get a new iPad Pro for most people. For creative professionals who do a mix of keyboard based work and pencil based work, the new iPad pros are a much better value proposition, but even then most of those professionals likely already have a MacBook and a drawing interface. @@tamimatharemadi  He is a tech reviewer dummy, tech reviewers do the extreme for review purpose.

There are some things iPad do objectively better than even the most powerful PCs and servers. If you don&#39;t want to believe that, then that is okay. Just use what you like @@alihorda Form factor and DRM support. Laptops may be the same size, but they are locked to 720p-1080p for DRM protected media. iPad OS can play back full 4k. How about touch pen support? Windows tablets have terrible touch pens, and one would have to separately get an expensive Wacom tablet. Yeah phones can do most of the same things, but form factor can be a real game changer. Plus, for people like me who prefer to keep social media off of my phone, it can serve as a secondary device for using social media. I&#39;ve already shown that the iPad can be better than laptops, phones, and PCs in certain scenarios. As for foldables, that&#39;s funny. iPad has the advantage of not having a bending screen with a distracting crease. At the end of the day, it really is just what a particular user needs. I personally like to see the positives of all things in technology. Just like I&#39;m probably gonna pick my laptop for running AAA games or emulators over the iPad. @@boxlad7583 Exactly.

Wow MKBHD and Mrwhosetheboss had completely different takes on this \\U0001fae8 Fr! The iPad could feature a MacOS version when slapped on with the Magic Keyboard or connected to an external monitor.

He didn&#39;t yet, so close though! That nano screen definitely eats up brightness and the deep blacks though. I feel like they made it so thin because they want to emulate a laptop screen as much as possible. One of the main issues with using the Magic Keyboard is how top heavy it is when in on a lap.. perhaps this design feature was kept in mind? what is the last song used?

Theres no bragging rights for blowing money on a expensive toy. If you own a iPad from 2019 or ANY M iPad model you are not missing anything bc theyve added nothing to begin with.

Can it be bent unintentionally easily? 😅😅 I can buy a car for that price  in Trinidad can we do hardcore coding on the iPad like python etc Shut up and take my money … BOMBOCLAT I’ve bough an iPad pro in 2019 and I haven’t had the need for a laptop since. I can do everything I need on it just easier and faster than on a laptop. I understand is not for everyone but for 90% of population who doesn’t use it with an specific purpose is going to have a better screen, better battery, better speakers, better performance and is going to last longer than an average laptop. All they need to do is upgrade the software more capable in tablets and they&#39;ll replace laptops very promptly. Boss create a your MOBILE COLLECTION TOUR plz 🙏❤<br>And WATCHES etc ... But the whole point of remarkable it to use it while being disconnected from unnecessary apps and notifications. I think replacing it with the iPad would hinder your productivity apple people buy all anyway An iPad is a great machine, but it will never replace a Mac because of iPadOS. We had the same story since the M1 iPad. The second i saw the metal keyboard from apple directly I realized they&#39;re definitely killing the macbook air in the next 5yr-decade. People in the comments be like people are buying iPad Pro in 2024 to watch movies without knowing millions of pro users use iPad for their work flow. To be honest, I made the switch in 2022. The Apple Pencil “pro” has a very little amount of change from the old one, and same with keyboard. I think you COULDVE done the change 3+ years ago and it will feel almost the same as now. Why only 1 camera now? Thats why its lighter😅 I have spend years with all the ipad sizes.. best one is the mini. I hope it gets a pro version. <br><br>- The 12.9 stay at home <br>- Ipad mini LTE on the go <br>- iphone mini go well with the mini lte Daaaamn No way I would ever spend that much on a glorified tablet when I could get a fully kitted out gaming laptop that does even more for under half the price.  Also, can you imagine breaking the ipad and how much it would cost for repair, ouch! Tip for PC users: If you have the money: Get a desktop PC and remote connect to it through AV1 decoding That&#39;s looks like a heavy influence from Samsung tab s9 ultra and dex mode 😅 You could have bought a good second hand car for that money The m1 keyboard has many glitches as a user myself so this is probably a big mac like improvement I’ve been using the 2018 for a long time, it’s still pretty fast. I’m about to buy the new one too with the Max configuration. I wouldn’t spend that kind of money just to play games on it but if you are into drawing/animation/painting it’s been the best product on the market for a long time. I have a $1400 windows laptop that runs every game maxed except fallout 76 (almost maxed, screw you Todd), apple can hop off a cliff Despite my best efforts, I couldn&#39;t replace my laptop with an iPad due to iOS limitations when compared to macOS. In simpler terms, iPads are like vitamins, while laptops are like painkillers. However, IPad cannot replace laptop until MacOS is available on it. I think Jerry could just rip this one in half, let alone bend it lol! I&#39;m waiting for @jerryrigeverything Wow this video it looks more like a paid\\xa0advertising ...without the P explicitly marked<br>Actually the (only) advantage of an e-ink tablet is exactly not doing what a iPad can...it won&#39;/can&#39;t compete with an iPad <br>I&#39;ve tried to get rid of laptop....had iPad Pro with magic keyboard (which is far of being easy to use where you&#39;re not sitting at a table) and Pencil for some years. While it&#39;s very good for taking notes via GoodNotes, for media consuming for some photo/video editing whatsoever...what I&#39;ve found is that as soon as you are in need of doing some serious project with multiple files opened and 2 screens, iPad OS will haunt you...Yes it does some sort of multitasking but you must be able to enjoy punishing yourself doing that and your productivity will hardly match the one using a laptop. Also having all at your disposal can be incredibly distracting some times...when you just want to be focused at something (like receiving an email during a meeting)...<br>In the end I gave the iPad to my wife, bought a MacBook for all the work and for my notes I bought a Scribe (not Remarkable cause is imho too expensive for what it offers supplementary compared with Scribe).\\xa0<br><br>Maybe, just maybe if there will be ever a MacOS like for iPad someday, I&#39;ll come back to it... Useless with iPadOS If you remove back cover and put heatsink with fan and use it as a desktop then it will be a true M4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=78\">1:18</a> you will instantly understand why an iPad is better if you play rhythm games like Arcaea, Lanota or Phigros, phone too small, touchscreen laptops are just inherently bad for it. finallyyyy someone said something about mobile rithm games slap the iPad Pro with Tandem OLED screen to a Macbook = the next Macbook series. The next Macbook series is already here. They&#39;re just selling the screens first! If someone buys this  💩 then definitely there is something wrong in this world This is basically a 16 minute video of a guy publicly justifying to himself his expensive purchase 😂 Apple really sold their first protoype of the foldable ipad this year huh Waiting for the apple Cloth Pro to be announced next year. 980 Dollars only for £3000 I expect it to have no bezels, those are chunky monsters I have tablets and Laptop for windows and Apple and i see that i love to work on windows because it gives me laptop experience in my surface pro 9 tablet.<br><br>I wish apple also can implement Mac os for ipad or Ipad os should be similar like Mac Os A 16-minute-long video about why Surface tablets has been a good idea all along. I don&#39;t have money to buy the techs smartphones and laptops but i really like what you do...for me you&#39;re my teacher @Mrwhosetheboss much love and respect...am DJ Black CatUG from Uganda The major subtle downside: 4K in Netflix and HBO is not supported. &quot;Just&quot; HDR. This ad brought to you by Apple. Why is nobody talking about this audio zoom thing? I would like to have your macbook I have a m1 and magic case im thinking what everyone is thinking 😂😂😂 Drop test on a 3600$ tablet soon ? 🤣😜 PS ... Remember you have no file manager on iPad, so you depend on other device to backup (forget cloud) The new ipad pro, the most powerful youtube and netflix device &quot;I don&#39;t like tablets because they&#39;re phone / laptop hybrids... But thjs one is better because it&#39;s a tablet thsg costs as much as a laptop.. But it&#39;s thiiiiim&quot;.<br><br>Shill. As always. Stick an M4 in an iPhone and I might switch to Apple if they get the AI part right because privacy will become ever more essential. Add a good microphone and gesture to the watch so it&#39;s the equivalent of saying hey Siri, Dick Tracey style and you have a hardware setup that&#39;s ready for the AI assisted future. Woop apple just discovered the surface... 350 for the keyboard attachment? That thing definitely costs £20 max to make You could spend the same amount of money on an incredible PC with an excellent processor and graphics card instead of wasting them on an overpriced toy. Can you please just put you freaking outro back.dude😖 Hands-On ? Seriously dude , you are making clickbait Captions and Thumbnails ? We don&#39;t expect this from you @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> 😮 @mrwhosetheboss - what do you do with the tech that you don&#39;t use as your daily drivers? I have iPad air 64 GB m2 and on this iPad, I had some annotated PDFs which  got corrupted by itself on this iPad. I have not seen this problem with any other device and when I talked to iCare, they told me please do not annotate PDFs because they do not have a solution for this, and apparently few other users also have the same problem.  Worst decision of buying iPad Air. I do not recommend. I&#39;ll be waiting for your feedback on that. If you change your MacBook for an Ipad I would love to know the results of it. For me the main downside of a tablet is that it can not do what a full laptop does (at leats not as easy). If I had this money I would buy a really good gaming pc Apple fans can sell one kidney  and one  eye Love the vids If the screen was good, we wouldn&#39;t see reflections of everything in it while it was on full brightness What a bunch of copycats! Sponsored by apple💀 Sounds interesting, but as a long-time Mac (1992), iPad, and Remarkable user, good luck with the iPad battery life compared with Remarkable. The former always seems to be short on battery when needed, whereas the latter keeps going for a lot longer..... You have more money that sense? Man, the folks setting prices at Apple lately must just be twitching in a pile of cocaine and empty Red Bull cans.  I couldn’t justify buying this at twice my income. Watch it fold like paper when Jerryrigeverything does a durability test iPad does not require laptop space for working. Of course you can try to use it as PC alternative option but you will have struggles. For me I get rid of my Macbook Air because I didn&#39;t use it as much as I thought. I bought it because instead I would have to buy iPad + keyboard so it was obvious choice for me to go with Macbook Air. I later realised that I didn&#39;t need the keyboard for just scrolling and streaming. It&#39;s far easier for me to travel with just an iPad especially that you do not have to use dedicated charger and in Macbook you kinda have to. It&#39;s also easier to grab iPad and do something on it than grabbing Macbook Air, even as thin as it is :). I ended up waiting for this release and ordered base iPad Pro 256 GB and I think this will suit all of my needs. I believe OLED is worth this price - we will see how about the burning in the end, after few months/years but I do not care. I used Tab S amoled and didn&#39;t see any burning. I still have it but it&#39;s barely usable because of the garbage software. I wish I can afford it and the amount of cost in Australia $5000 for it $3.999 for 2TB Still thicker then a tab s9 ultra and a worse display Very good. But why not an Ipad mini Pro? Try using an app designed for iPhone on the iPad and tell me it’s “designed” for iPad.<br><br>90% of devs just tick a button to allow the app on iPad and just stretch the UI. Hell even the instagram app and Facebook are like this - you are the mercy of devs catering to what?

I know with jailbreaking u can get Filza, which lets u edit everything. But, I’m guessing these new iPads are going to take a while to find a new vulnerability, since they have a brand new and unique chip. Yikes. I don&#39;t trust anyone who has never seen a need for an iPad. Also someone who uses an Android phone and Android tablets? 🤣 there is no way apple will make ipad as good as mac Now lets see what Surface pro does with the x elite chip and galaxy tab s10... ball is now in MS and samsung hands Hot take, i miss web services over apps.

So a Microsoft Surface? Yo @Mrwhosetheboss wait until you discover ipad hubs too (:  Also if you are not playing games and using your pc/laptop for mostly browsing and office stuff ipad with keyboard pencil combo is the one of the best. But... if you are not in the apple eco system and if you already have a xiaomi or samsung tablet with keyboard/pencil combo again why should you spend over 3000$ ? But not gonna lie i am using M1 chip ipad pro and even M1 is over kill for ipad and now they put M4. Super light which is very good but that tiny thickness may be a problem. It looks too fragile.

The thing all the points also applies to either m1 air, ipad pro 4th and 5th gen, yet NOW is the right time to change from mac? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=209\">3:29</a> I think the next wwdc will be a big step in that direction especially since tim cook hyped it up. I absolutely love your humor and love your channel ❤ If you couldn’t replace your Mac with the last version, this doesn’t change anything. Until they change the OS, these hardware upgrades are somewhat pointless. Apple, just release dual OS option (Mac OS when attached to keyboard, iPad OS when not). Make the iPad capable of running MacOS. Then it would sell like hot cakes, but fortunately kill the Mac at the same time. With the USB port, you can just use an external drive. <br><br>I replaced my MacBook Pro 2014 with the iPad Pro M2 and I only have great things to say about it. So its pretty much a notebook with less ports. Booooringggg i cant wait to see the Jerry Rig Everything video of the IPad being broken in half, i feel like apple is again in the time they tried to make everything as thin as they can and like on the iphone 6, thats gonna be a problem. because in something like a backpack theres even more tension than in a pocket of your pants, i definitely wouldnt buy it because i think its just gonna bend if not even broken in half at some point So it&#39;s a bit better and way more expensive Microsoft Surface for mac users. kinda overpriced and old keyboards and even 2nd gen apple pencils cant use. ONLY APPLE CAN DO In 6 months: why I sold my iPad m4 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=502\">8:22</a> @mrwhosetheboss did the apple thing =D <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=176\">2:56</a> first thing I wanna point out is that you won’t worry about sitting on your ipad in your pocket. my current ipad is always on a stand and I only remove it when I put it in a carrying bag and I’m definitely not sitting on that bag. So apple is loosing people interest in laptops that they now have to reimagine or rewire people into new ways and reasons to buy ipad. The apple pencil is now doing what surface pen is doing from past 11 years... The iPad which is touch device doesn&#39;t work good with the final cut pro 2 without keyboard..lol &quot;Mobile games are better designed&quot;, that&#39;s the point when I stopped listening :D how about using a convertible laptop? Even though they look great, I just don&#39;t see how it can replace my laptop. I really dislike apps, prefer the website for most stuff, and hate touchscreen keyboards.. that specialized coating sounds good though, could use that on my macbook I have the M1 iPad Pro 12.9 and honestly this iPad is NOTHING new. I have the Logitech Smart Folio, and that is practically the same as the new Smart Keyboard. The biggest limitation of the iPad is the software, and it’s still the same so, no, it won’t replace your MacBook, you are just being brainwashed. Yeah, if you have a new enough iPad there is absolutely no point in upgrading... Especially if you have a keyboard for it, because the new ones don&#39;t fit in classic apple fashion. &quot;I always feel better when a  product tells me to use their app than when they direct me to a website&quot; Never Cook Again Thin means breaks easily... it&#39;ll snap if you breathe on it wrong mark my words! They actually said its just as strong. <br>Jerryrigeverything will probably show us But why are the bezels still so thick? The iPad would be a perfect MacBook replacement, except for software compatibility. So many apps exclusive to MacOS are the reason people buy them. I love your videos . I watch a lot of tech youtubers but i like the way you give honest and true info about a product .Watching your videos makes me feeel like I am in a lecture class and i love that actually😊😊 I think it would be disappointing. Apple&#39;s iPads are in such position right now where they can be superior to MB or at least the lower end when it comes to performance. Combine that with all the accessories, faaar superior display, touch screen and all of the superior mobile ecosystem that you mentioned and penvil support, it suddenly makes the MBs obsolete. But Apple won&#39;t do that imo. Now really. <br><br>Its the OS that makes the difference. Its not the same as macbook @@Aneliuse I never said it was the same Too much money!!! Give it 2 years you can get it for 500 dollars What is the normal wrighter thing you were using Everytime I see Tim Crook it makes me laugh. I keep thinking of a &quot;human wishbone&quot; I mean just how bowlegged can one be ??? LMAO LMAO. Don&#39;t spend this stupid amount of money and do what I did. Went out and got a 2nd Gen Ipad Pro for SUPER CHEAP which literally does everything I need it to for about one eighth the price of the new one Intel core i9 Apple knows they need to step it up because windows on snapdragon X/X plus/X elite is on its way. this will be a big deal because yes snapdragon X soc will start on windows but it won&#39;t be 6 months before Android and Linux runs on them too. Thats why they just crushed the competition again Bro i goy an ipad pro ad while watching this I wouldn’t bother with the nano screen it scatters more light If they bring macOS to I pad and introduce some Autodesk apps I will switch. But apple doesn&#39;t want to. For the average user it Still have not that much use over the m1 ipad realy Look I am a med student and I feel that the iPad is hands down the best device because I can use it for note taking , pdf annotations , social media , gaming and consuming content ( not as a camera you weirdos😂). So I place the iPad on top of my apple products scale that&#39;s my whole year worth of school fee💀💀 Samsung already did all that years ago... It is definitely a mistake! Soon you’ll know 😪 iPads are so much more casual to use than a MacBook. The features of this apple pencil is similar to my old 2013 Samsung note 3 pencil😀 Lol this man&#39;s going to be extremely disappointed if he expects a smart home just from Apple products. Most of these reviews are biased. You don&#39;t really need this tab.. Just use your older tab or get an old M1 or M2 Tab or Samsung&#39;s Tab 🤟🏻😌 Where to buy that grey Pullover? I love my iPad Pro 12.9 that I got last year. I’m legally blind and it is freeing for me as I can do so much that I cannot see on the phone. However. Thanks very much arun. I now want this new one hahaha. I’m probably lucky I can’t afford it as I’d be hovering over the buy button too <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=570\">9:30</a> - Thank you for realizing this. Apple has stated this many times themselves. I have a MacBook and an IPad Pro (with cellular)- I am a professional video editor. It is EXTREMELY rare that I use my Mac. BTW it only costs an extra $10 a month to add the iPad as a cellular device, and it was beyond worth it. It has become a central hub, while I’m working. My iMessages, mail, and FaceTime all come to this as well. It also allows me to pick up and work anywhere. I love my 2022 edition, keyboard and pencil- and I am SO EXCITED to get these new ones. Very rarely do I spend money on items for work and myself 😂 For a 1tb iPad Pro you pay $4500 AUD… more than a 4090…😂😂😂 Spend thousands on a tablet, give it a keyboard. May as well just get a macbook Still cant use statistic program for university whereas the mac has it... for free even Samsung fan here 🙋\\u200d♂️<br>Apple really did cook with this one, the only downside is the price but that&#39;s just apple being apple Well the m2 iPad also has center stage and it’s pretty dope for ft The thinner the iPads are the more uncomfortable to hold them. I love my older 9.7 Pro iPad with its curved edges - use it as a book reader. Using newer iPad pro is pain for longer time. Can you make phone calls with that? HELL NAW AM NOT BUYING APPLES NEW TABLET THAT ALMOST WORTH LIKE A APPLE VISION  FOR KIDS<br><br>(samsung has better quality price stuff) Finally, an optimal way to watch cocomelon I can’t seem to find info on the normal new iPad. I’ve heard that the iPad 2024 will be cheaper than the iPad 2022, but nobody seems to have a video about it? Will be waiting for ur performance test on the aaa games on ipad like resident evil and death stranding to actually see where M4&#39;s GPU stands As a developer this would never replace my pc but you can now see more faces in a zoom/teams/whatever meeting... I swear everyone who insists that they need the m4 is either really well off and has the money to burn, or could have done with an m1 air that costs less than half as much Yes, it is a good aid but can not replace a laptop or PC. Yes. Simply YES Why??... CODM 😂😂 BRO WAS DEEP THROATING THAT TOOTH BRUSH WHAT THE The only problem I have with ipads are that they still run on ipados and not macos.. making it incompatible with a lot of important apps. Arun don&#39;t worry I still think every single pun of yours is funny When the magic keyboard first came out for the iPad Pro I immediately bought one.  It was <b>the absolute best</b> keyboard I had ever typed on, and that is having used macs for years and years at this point.  It is absolutely the selling point of any iPad Pro and 1000% worth every penny it costs.  But for me, unfortunately, I absolutely need the tools MacOS provides.  It is the one limitation that has kept me from upgrading my 2018 11&quot; iPad Pro.  Yes it is very nice to type on. iPadOS has improved every year.  But... its just not there.  They need the mac features for someone like me.  Adding the function row on the new Magic Keyboard gives me *hope*. Who would spend $5600 on a Ipad Apple subscribers: 18.9M hmm...<br>MrWTB subscribers: 18.5M hmm...<br>MKBHD subscribers: 18.8M hmm....<br><br>Who&#39;s gonna win? My 2020 iPad Pro is my most used device. The boss is Apple. That is who the boss is The problem with tablets is if you want a very good Android tablet or iPad it is  going to cost a lot of money .<br>I can remember getting a tablet for 230 Bucks it was c.r.a.p inferior to my ZenFone 4 in performance it only had 1GB of ram and a weak CPU Why new products don’t provide new things. Yearly releasing new stuff is stupid. Keep old things doing for same. Arun your light guy did a bad job at setting up the lights as the video went by, he could have adjusted as the light was dimming outside or maybe you guys wanted to be symmetry with the outer light in the environment to that of the room&#39;s set up. Arun dont buy the matt display (marque&#39;s opinion) I thought this same thing yesterday. Can i Code an compile an Android Apo on an Ipad? Should i buy macbook m3 pro or ipad pro m4... I have a computer, i have a laptop, i have a tablet, i have a phone..... non of these can be replaced by the other. Ask again in 15 to 20 years. Imagine dropping a $3600 ipad on the floor 💀 whatever it is, please change that retcehed wallpaper used in the ipad shown in the video It&#39;s pure stupidity to pay more than 500 for a phone or tablet because they got much better value for money We all gonna wait for the bend test from zack anyway lol And you can&#39;t even code on this, why apple? I think I&#39;d prefer an Android foldable, but I really love the new keyboard. arun has gone off the rails saying the iPad in its current form could be a Macbook replacement. it’s literally a nerfed Macbook If he thinks this can be a MacBook he should try running an IT business from just a iPad… GLHF with that… Apple just makes up an excuse for stupidity rich to spend money on, and “bought” it - most influential people get it as a freebie or have amounts of cash laying around it doesn’t matter how much it costs. I can afford buying one but for this amount of money I rather buy a MacBook Pro then an iPad in it’s current OS state. It’s in no way comparable to macOS at its current design state and Apple never will do that because otherwise MacBooks would get an touch screen upgrade… they want customers to get both- that’s why iPad OS doesn’t support multi profile users. If you got 4 kids you better get 4 iPad littles and 2 airs or better… but for the birds and bees we won’t add stickers to the new iPads… Apple only cares about more money - not their customers. He makes some really good points tho, I.e. most online services now have apps as their main portal. I am definitely on the same boat where I prefer all my banking, e-commerce, internet and phone payment gateways etc are all done on an app as opposed to a website portal. Some e-commerce companies give better incentives/discounts on their mobile apps than on their website. I’m just waiting that those apps to run on macOS as well, since all modern Macs are now running on ARM M-series chips. Then we’re back to square one.<br><br>It’s definitely not a true 1:1 replacement yet but for Arun’s use cases, he seemed to be convinced that it’s possible for him. His use cases and ours aren’t the same. But it’s probably true, the future is definitely app-based and the iPad does that better than any Macs. Guy is just lying to his audience It depends on your use case man.<br>If for him it is a MacBook replacement than that means whatever he was doing on the macbook, he can do on the iPad with little to no drawback. It isn&#39;t necessary a MacBook replacement for everyone, neither is he implying that. I feel like he dropped the ball on this one. Sadly absolutely nothing had changed in terms of the software with this new iPad lineup. Metal finish magic keyboard still loses to Macbook because the angle is still limited. Even the M1 iPad can do so much but Is neutered at the software level and has been for a lot of years now, I don&#39;t see that changing either. @@michaelcamello527 nah he did say “for my use”. If it can be a MacBook replacement for his use then that’s good for him. For me it’s almost a laptop replacement, the only thing I miss on my iPad that I still use my laptop for is blender, and league of legends. For anything else I can choose between my iPad or laptop and there would be practically no difference. The one and only thing holding the iPad back is… iPadOS 💀 Also some of the &quot;new features&quot; of the new ipad pro have been available on the older ones for a fraction of the price. Like the barrelroll of the pencil. Or the squeezing when you could just double tab on the old one. Additionally most of the new processing power of the m4 chip cant be accessed due to heat and software issues @@Connor_Conntroller m4 is good because it has more performance per watt. Thus less heat and faster performance before and after thermal throttle @@nicowasheremate This is the one thing holding back the iPad. The tech alone is good enough, but the software is what kills is. Heck, I would&#39;ve replaced my Macbook a long time ago for engineering university if I could take my Calculus notes and program Software Engineering projects, and manage the stuff like on my Macbook with the iPad. It&#39;s the perfect 2-in-1 in terms of hardware. But on software? It sucks. @@oh-noe it does, But If you faktor in the Space lost for heat transfer you simply cannot unlock this Performance. Of course the full specs are Not out yet But you can see that in the comparison between the new iPad Pro/the old m1/2 Chips and the Mac Book pro m3 Chips with the m1/2 comparison @@michaelcamello527 18.7M subscribers. expects everyone to buy his spiel hook line &amp; sinker no questions asked.... @@fortimusprime Yeah, Hopefully some announcment at WWDC could fix it @@horrorstory-wp3gd I really hope this is the case. I just want iPads to be useable for my case. I wish it was perfect as a 2-in-1. @@Connor_Conntroller they claim they&#39;ve updated their cooling solution though. We&#39;ll have to see on release if that was just marketing fluff or if it was based on some truth &quot;The blacks are so deep&quot;<br>Yea I got those &quot;Deep blacks&quot; in my 200$ phone too. Basically LED is off. Amoled is cheap now, anyone? First of all, nobody asked for a thinner tablet. They may be asking for a lighter one but how light do you need them to be? Second with a thinner body, comes smaller battery and more thermal throttling. Third, anyone gonna mention the aspect ratio on this thing? Last but not least, I truly believe tablets one day will replace laptops but they will need a couple more ports and much better software integration. I&#39;m sorry, but if it still runs ios and iOS app,s, it&#39;s not a laptop replacement for any  significant use case. I have an iPad and cringe whenever I hear people call it a PC replacement. <br><br>Also would like to remind people that initial &quot;reviews&quot; aren&#39;t reviews.  Apple historically manipulates media availability to beneficial content. So this is more of a marketing summary.<br><br>Also trying to use my iPad on my lap like a laptop even with the magic keyboard is a joke along with the new iPad pricing.<br><br>Sorry MWTB, I know you gotta make that money... You do you man. Don’t convert to dollars. This is England Apple should have called the three chips after the M1 the M1.1, M1.2, and M1.3.  They haven&#39;t actually created a new generation yet. Bro you&#39;re the reason why infinite amounts of people confuse &quot;whose&quot; and &quot;who is&quot; Why so dark - I felt lack of lighting in your video Was mildly interesting until I saw a double layered OLED lmfao. If it is in any way close to DL LCD Sony use on their monitors (or maybe better due to OLED), this is prolly the best screen on the market lol. The only thing we need to know is if it&#39;s QDOLED for max color gamut I wouldn&#39;t buy it even if I had won the Euromillions lottery. thats a nice gaming pc price right there... Still, iPad is just over powered hardware, limited by software Mrwhosetheboss is the GOAT Mrwhosetheboss videos are always better than MKBH. it seems like he had so much more time to think about the product and contemplate on it before giving an opinion. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> ayooo bro 💀 You really took your time testing the iPad with that female staff 😏 Great video even though I dont even like apple products... I just watched cause i enjoy your videos hahaha ❤❤❤ Most of the good things for the new iPads come from being better than the MacBooks. So, against laptops without OLED, without touchscreen, still in clamshell form, and without a proper packet manager, ... Market segmentation and keeping features from consumers is making Apple billions. bro why is your camera quality getting worse and dark? 🔥 Mrwhosetheboss, I think a lot of Apple clients feel exactly like you feel over the new Ipad Pro.  You &quot;want&quot; it.  Now, I too &quot;want it&quot;....but I don&#39;t need it.  Your video had a lot of &quot;I want it&quot; but if you step back and ask yourself &quot;Do you need it?&quot;  Nope, you don&#39;t.  So, save the money ... for now.  Wait for the M5.  🙂 the most basic ipad pro is more expensive than my pc. So we&#39;re just gonna ignore how he was using that tooth brush 💀💀 he makes me regret buying my mac m2 air You bought it because it&#39;s cents to you. Stop it Laughs in fold (phone + tablet) It still uses iPad os, if only it used Mac OS instead. No matter how powerful it is , it is limited by its os Sounds like an infomercial to me. Just get a laptop with touchscreen If you didnt notice, Huawei launch Matepad Pro 13.2 half year ago which has capability to replace laptop. Of course performance wise no as good as apple but they did it first. Still iPad OS… <br><br>Bring a stylish menu bar<br>Dialog boxes<br>The actual finder from macOS<br>A resizable dock that’s scrollable<br>Full Microsoft office (Microsoft!)<br>Smaller UI Elements it’s ridiculous <br>A normal mouse<br>Proper windowing system<br>A desktop or just something better with icons closer together <br><br>Until then not wasting my money,<br>Will stick with MacBook Seems this will appeal to a very niche market. I imagine school/college/university students and businesses are the biggest market for laptops - they will all want the traditional set up. I expected at least one more usb port. One on each side would be nice. I found your channel recently. I have to tell you that yours has quickly become my favorite channel. Keep up the good work. I feel like apple want you to have a iPhone a ipad and a MacBook because switching to a tablet at least with Apple feels purposely hamstrung because they want you to buy a MacBook as well <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=944\">15:44</a> 1000£ extra for 1,744 extra Tb 😂😂😂 Apple must be smoking something when 2Tb top tier gen4 SSD are like 150£ Unfortunately since they run iPadOS, what is the point? They don&#39;t do anything that the iPad Pros of 7 years ago didn&#39;t do. At least not right now (they are gaining AI features in iPadOS 18 if feature parity between iPadOS and iOS continues. If rumours are true the A series iPads won&#39;t get iPadOS 18). The Pencil gained new features, but that&#39;s the pencil gaining features. The keyboard gained new stuff, but that&#39;s the keyboard that gains the new features. Plus if you&#39;re adding a keyboard, you now just have a severely limited laptop When you&#39;re an Apple simp, it&#39;s not that hard to figure out. I still don&#39;t see this replacing my surface go. Windows is simply so much more versatile, nevermind having a micro sd slot for storage extension and not beeing locked into the Apple ecosystem. Hey Arun. I just have one thing to say, after seeing this review of yours. &quot;People should stop watching Apple product reviews online totally&quot;. You being a tech reviewer, who has the access to basically all the new tech, pricey or not, should have the moral duty to clearly say &quot;bad is bad&quot;, specially given your videos are made for the people, and not for the companies like Apple.\\r<br>There have been other youtubers whom I unsubscribed, just because they couldn&#39;t say one negative thing about Apple, just so that Apple invites them to their launch event and they can have these early access videos.\\r<br>Like right now, you don&#39;t know the exact M4 specs (said the exact same stuff as their launch video which weirdly compares it to M2 and even M1, &quot;not to M3&quot;), yet you seem to be totally fine with it. Why aren&#39;t you even talking about things like, thinner body means smaller battery (they had the chance to double the battery life with this ipad), and costly new pro pencil.\\r<br>These &quot;consumer harming&quot; tactics then seeps to other brands and they too start the trend like the removal of charger, super pricy accessories and the &quot;this-works-better-with-our-other-device&quot; tradeoff.\\r<br>Why cant you be like &quot;THIS IS WRONG&quot;. Why do you always want to put Apple reviews in a very optimistic way, no matter how crazy they are with the decisions about such new tech? Please do not loose yourself on moral grounds as being a content creator, try to be humanly helpful to the people, the very people whose views are youtubers bread and butter. Otherwise, there is no difference between such review videos and Apple removing chargers from phones calling it &quot;environmental friendly&quot;. fr like it&#39;s a great product but it&#39;s worth 600 dollars at most, not half of 6000 I think this is because he only used it in the apple event, where he can&#39;t test properly, or this is a embargo date and the only topics he is allowed to mention are ones Apple has chosen, so most likely are positive. He said he will do a full review later, and that might be more critical. @@The_JediPenguin you can check his previous Apple product reviews. They all be like, Arun finds a way to somehow call it so game changing and always optimistic about even the cons of it.<br>And btw, check MKBHD video on the same, he literally called it pointless to have such an iPad, no buttering of words or optimistic approach to not hurt Apple @@PFnove yes brother. See how Arun &quot;cleverly&quot; pointed out how this new ipad is an alternate to his Macbook + remarkable tablet in many scenarios. But he forgets, what he has bought remarkable for, only remarkable can do that (And the ipads at the time when he bought remarkable would offer the same functionality as the current ipads, from his usage perspective.) Nobody mentioned, but that&#39;s next level. No, since we already are next level, this is next next level.<br><br><br>😁<br><br>@mrwhosetheboss, thank you for your thoughtful review. You catch my interest although I&#39;m not interested at all into a $3000+ losable device Soon they will make a new division of there business... Apple inc and Apple inc pro I always think that Apple products are too expensive and give you two little features for the price, but this new iPad might be the first Apple device to change that If you get an iPhone you can hotspot without turning hotspot on for easy Wi-Fi access So the iPad is worth it if you want to replace your notebook for 3600$.<br>Got it. You bought it because you got money for saying this. He didn&#39;t mention that the keyboard is sold separately... At that point another $100 around price. I would rather buy a MacBook than that. I mean I get having a iPad with this much capable but as a pc guy I feel it’s locked down setup is not that great. Even though it has a desktop chip it can’t run desktop apps. I understand the appeal but not for me. Great vid I&#39;d already choose to just go to a website then have to install a new app. Horrible thing that&#39;s become the norm In as much as this is an impressive device, I don&#39;t think this will replace laptops. Most of the use cases you mentioned are majorly issues that the iPad solves for just, not the majority of people. Also, the device is pretty expensive. I do wonder sometimes exactly what planet Apple are on. Who is the target market for a 4 grand tablet? Who&#39;s buying this? And why do you hate your money? sure replace your laptop with a giant screen that has even more limited software than the laptop. Crazy waste of money. <br><br>Like for real what apps are you going to use outside of the apple apps preinstalled I’m curious to what the battery is going to be like. With a dual OLED screen, powerful laptop grade chip with dedicated hardware just to run the display and in a thinner chassis..I also noticed they never mentioned it once in the keynote. &quot;You can now squeeze the pencil to bring up the menu&quot;...Samsung is laughing Nothing has changed in the iPad v last iPad. You sound like a kid, impressionable by fluf marketing language. Folks, go watch MKBHD, it&#39;s merely spec bump (and actually worse cameras). I also don&#39;t see how Arun is really using s24 ultra as he gets full on aroused with every apple PR event. Never thought he&#39;d become the #1 apple fanboy. Somehow this video gave me an unreal MKBHD-Vibe lol Good luck with that. Tried it with an M1 iPad and it was a big fail. I don&#39;t see anything different here. I bit thinner and a slightly better screen. What it really needs is MacOS (and a lot more RAM). As an M1 ipad user, I can say that the biggest downside is the OS. Where are my adobe aps apple? Stage manager isn’t really my thing also, I would like to be exactly like macOS. I want the IPAD TO RUN MACOS. Not this ipadOS thing. It is really close for me to switch from my bulky windows laptop, but the OS is absolute garbage. Great tablet evolution, apple made this one great Can this iPad support multiple users…. No Please may I have an M3 MacBook Air? Didn&#39;t you buy it to make a video about it? 😉 $3600 is absolutely ludicrous. I know people are still going to buy it though. Only 400k more people This is what happens when you have so much money, you don&#39;t know what to do with it. If you’re getting rid of your MacBook I’ll happily take it haha &quot;The World&#39;s Biggest Hypocrite&quot; 😂😂😂😂😂 Where is the benefit of changing the devices thiskness in the range of fractions of a millimeter? in the end it doesn´t matter if it´s 6,2 or 5,3 mm thin. But you´d need a new case, because the old one just doesn´t fit perfectly anymore. EARLY ZZZ COPY ON THE IPAD I SAW IT <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=349\">5:49</a> . the game is suposted to have a worldwide release in july and yet there it is on the ipad That is going to be 2,877.00GBP disappointment I am afraid. aaaaaah no thanx The bendgate flashback is crazy. older ipads had most of the capabilities that you were highlighting pls reveal pixel 8a &quot;That&#39;s an obscene amount to pay for a table,...BUT...&quot; It says a lot about what Apple thinks about it&#39;s customers when they are confident that they are gullible enough to pay for a tablet what they would pay for a motorbike or used car. Plus the keyboard and pencil to actually make it useful NINJA KAMUI MASK DESIGN Louis Rossman watching this is thinking of the repair nightmare this probably is. All the inconveniences under the hood The display is made by SAMSUNG😂 Zero interest. I got an ipad pro once. Still the 4:3 screen ratio which leaves you while watching movies with tremendeous big letterboxes and a remaining movie screen at the size of the iphone pro max. If I want a great content tab I use my Samsung tab s9 ultra which has also a oled screen and a great 16.10 ratio. For work I use a Mac anyway. DONT DO IT imagine just seeing a video with a full view from evening t sunset just tell me why would i need ipad/tablet if i already have a smartphone and a laptop. <br><br>actually  i have macbook pro, and 2 android phones (yes, i m a weird 2 phone guy).. also i got one tablet xiomi pad 4. but I do not use to much other than media consumption and smart home device controls. Nice Apple commercial Arun is slowly but surely becoming a full on apple guy. From the iPhone to never being a watch guy to now using an Apple watch to now an iPad lol. I love how when ppl say this when they see someone using an Apple product for a brief time while 99% of the content is just the opposite. He uses the S24U more tho but I get what you mean ecosystem lock in it is.... Apple makes each product, the best to fit in their specific ecosystem<br>once you start, it will just feel better To buy another apple product to get that integration... That’s how Apple converted me. One product at a time.😅 Because they make good products I mean he literally uses a Samsung Ultra he&#39;s only buying them &#39;cause he has some money.

He uses the S24 Ultra what are you talking about? @Mrwhosetheboss.. so you started the video in the morning and ended in the night... 😝 Exactly. I also bought a top end Tablet in 2020. All I ended up with watching Netflix and YouTube in my bed and during travelling. I didnt even use it for writing email. Cool 😮 Why do you spit when saying three? (Thuurreee) not worth it until u can run macos app directly on it You could buy the best pc money can buy and it wouldn&#39;t come close that price 🤦 Forget the apps. What you are trying to say is that Macs dont have touch screens. As an Apple fanboy, I hope this current apple led by tim cook just fails.<br>Gone are the days of the ambitious Steve Jobs Real Steve Jobs would be ashamed of Apple today depute the company being so big these days @@NoshikiYT yeah it looks like tim cook is an excellent profit maximizer but shit innovator, sadly thats probably the first video that Arun is lighten by physical light which as the video progress it gets darker and darker and you can understand how much time it takes only to film it Apple should just take all the tech from the iPad Pro M4 and slap it into a redesign super thin and light 13&quot; and 15&quot; MacBook Air &quot;ultra light&quot; line. With oled displays too. Think old MacBook 12 thinness, but in a package that actually performs and has a few more ports. The new iPad Pro M4 show it can no be done in a thin fan less envelope, so why not a real &quot;air&quot; laptop as well? Let&#39;s be honest. This device only makes sense for artists (Digital illustrators, photographers, videographers, ..etc.) and rich college students. Im waiting for you to be disappointed:) Windows have Netflix app with download option. I was surprised finding out Mac don’t have one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=456\">7:36</a><br>I don&#39;t think Apple will allow the iPad to have 100% software functionality and support of the Mac, regardless of how powerful the M4 chip in the iPad is. This is because they will likely want you to buy both the iPad and the Mac, and offering full compatibility might cannibalize Mac sales. There is already iMac which is basically a big iPad with a keyboard. If there&#39;s a &quot;guess&quot; of greedy option, then Apple will do it 100% \\u200b@@proudbacteria1373 Its weaker and not portable, totally different market Much like why Macbooks are not getting touchscreens. It’s a shame because that didn’t used to be Apples mentality. When they launched the iPhone, they knew it would cannibalize the iPods but did it because they knew it was innovation and would suit them better in the long run. <br><br>Why can’t Apple make a Mac/iPad combo? Basically make the Mac Screen an iPad, then have the keyboard attach at the bottom with all the extra chips for added power? When you attach the tablet part, it becomes “MacMode” then when you detach, it goes to “iPad Mode”<br><br>Honestly that would be an incredible device if they could pull it off and Apple should be able too with all their in house chips. Don&#39;t NEVER buy a shitty Apple product! 😢😮 Exactly @@drewmorrison  I want to live in the timeline where Jobs is at the pinnacle of health and still alive today leading Apple. because they wwant more moneeeyyyy @@didiervandendaele4036hilarious double negatives are hilarious @@proudbacteria1373no its not You think this, but in truth Apple would love to hold the market in each area all on one device. Imagine an iPad that turns into a Mac computer and can also be used as an Apple TV They have been doing this for ages now. But if you are a wise buyer you know even the previous ipads are already capable enough to handle anything on the app store. Just think about your lifestyle if you really need those overpriced tech. Or you will just end up not using them most of the time. @@ILoveGrilledCheese let&#39;s wait and see @ILoveGrilledCheese\\xa0 I don&#39;t think apple want their ecosystem to revolve around the Ipad. @@paisleepunk of course it was not never my goal 😉 This is exactly my take on this whole situation. What Apple wants from the ipad pro is people like Arun saying &quot;i need this&quot; and for bonus points &quot;it will replace all of these other non-apple products&quot;. What Apple doesnt want from the ipad pro is people like Arun saying &quot;now i dont need this other very expensive apple product I own&quot;. Depending on how many people say the latter, I predict the next iteration will be nerfed even further. @Ravp90\\xa0 hence, they&#39;ll make sure you have a reason to buy the ipad and the mac. My suspicion is that the App Store revenue is so great that Apple will eventually ban all third party software from being installed on Macs. what do you think the iPhone did to the iPod touch? the iPod made apple one of the wealthiest companies on the planet and they OWNED the portable digital music industry @@robertobokarev439explain the ipod @@drewmorrison Oh trust me they probably can and have tested it. They just won&#39;t. This is not absolutely correct but also not wrong. This is happening because of Android and MS and not Apple. Apple is ahead of competition mainly due to Android offering fast depreciation (not enough support). On the other hand surface is a weak machine with bad battery. When competition wakes up Apple will offer unification. Until then apple offers best value even by buying two devices (iPad, MacBook) Totally disagree. The iPad and Mac are fundamentally very different. The iPad is designed from the ground up as a touch screen device, and the Mac is not. If the iPad functioned exactly like a Mac, that would be called a laptop. You can go buy one right now if you want. @mikemccormick6128\\xa0 Totally disagree with me or with Arun? Because I&#39;m not in support of what he said either. Listen to what he said, Watch from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=456\">7:36</a>. By the way, the ipad and the Mac have the same cpu, so they might as well have the same software compatibility. Form factor or product design is irrelevant and shouldn&#39;t be what determines what an ipad and a Mac should do. You can&#39;t put an M4 chip in an ipad just to watch Netflix, then put an M3 in a Mac for some serious computing jobs. That&#39;s crazy.  The ipad comes with a state-of-the-art keyboard which makes it good for productivity like the Mac. Why would someone buy a $3k+ ipad when it can&#39;t do the work of a laptop a macbook air with a touchscreen and 360degree foldability would be rad ngl That’s why they don’t have touchscreen laptops @@lyon1556 Very few people will be spending over $3,000 for the iPad. I&#39;m not sure actually how he got to $3600. I just spec&#39;d everything out and it only came to $2600, and with the Apple Pencil and magic Keyboard it was a little over $3,000. I spent about $1,800 including tax, the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard (about $1,300 if you subtract my trade-in). If I decide to upgrade again, I imagine that I wouldn&#39;t have to upgrade the Magic Keyboard or Apple Pencil. This could possibly be my last iPad though if I can replace the iPad with the Apple Vision Pro. I&#39;m still debating that.<br><br>Obviously, they will be putting the M4 in the MacBooks later on in the year. Maybe they needed the M4 for the Tandem OLED. They must have needed the M4 for some good reason. In my opinion, the Tandem OLED is a waste of money. The current LCD screen with MicroLED backlighting looks amazing. There is absolutely nothing to complain about.<br>I don&#39;t really agree with you about having the iPad run macOS. The iPad works better as a touch screen and the MacBook works better as a non-touch screen. They are just two completely different devices that serve different purposes. @@didiervandendaele4036none of their products are bad … @@drewmorrisonyou can see people all over the internet wanting to replace their Mac with iPad. Giving iPad the functionality of macbook will cause apple a significant loss in MacBook sales while the people why buy an iPad will be buying that iPad regardless so it’s a loss for apple. That’s the reason why they won’t do it Ever head of UTM I believe you have nailed the reasoning for apple. All I want is iPadOS in the next update to reimagine itself for the M series iPads to introduce a Samsung Dex style interface. Then I’m sold, but Dex and the universal back button is holding me back from switching. yeah a tab can hardly replace a laptop iPad Pro &gt; MacBook Air for most users.<br>PS: I bought a pencil off Amazon for £23. Works fine. too much power for something useless, get a mac guys That Nano coating defeats the purpose of OLED. Can&#39;t wait for Jerryrigeverithing durability test Wow. Nice paid review samsung pen i much better Paying three grand for a completely locked down device you barely even own and can&#39;t repair or upgrade and then pay taxes for on every purchase and when you run out of storage is the most Apple thing I&#39;ve ever heard. I&#39;d rather go back to the terminal. I still live and work IRL so not applicable for me..... 😮 I play games on iPad but over two thousand dollars on a iPad with closed eyes I would choose pc over iPad it is ridiculous They are still big phones. Try doing some normal file operations in the Files app. iPad OS falls apart very quickly Best screen they&#39;ve made for a device? Xiaomi stacked two OLED&#39;s first and that was last gen - well done to them, though😂😂 3 words, Arun: Network Attached Storage Youtubers pretending for 1000th time that a tablet will replace a laptop.

Better change the channel name to EverythingApplePro. What was bro doin with that toothbrush? 😂 It may be that the iPad is a very good and versatile device.<br>But as long as it is a walled garden environment without real multi user support it can not replace a real laptop anytime soon. My mobile cellular network carrier’s plan actually gives me an option to pay an extra like 1-2 euros per month for a whole new additional second extra separate individual actual real eSIM card! Maybe others do as well. (I live in France.) I&#39;m waiting iPad Basic with A15 Chip 🤣 I would rather have a galaxy s9 ultra This is a full video length ad! Nah. Ipads are underwhelming. I prefer the samsung ultra 2 - 7 year olds gonna love this one 🙏 Just promotional. Not an honest or backed up review. Just a list of specs and why they are “cool”. I think this is one of your worst videos. because............it wasn&#39;t a review, it&#39;s just him talking about something he thinks would have a huge influence on the tech world, specifically in this video, he hasn&#39;t even bought the Ipad, so of course this isn&#39;t a review, it&#39;s basically a &quot;how I feel about this drastic change&quot; video.<br><br><br>But yeah I&#39;ll agree that the new iPad will be really underwhelming if you go off of only this video.<br><br>but the the video, especially for the intent it was made for, is pretty good bought it because you rich I watched this full even tho I&#39;m broke 🤣 Did i just hear the phrase &quot;gaming on mac&quot;?

Apple Pencil is the reason why  I stopped using my iPad pro. It is too heavy for longer use If you need to buy separate keyboard+touchpad to really get most out of the ipad or to make it usable, then you might as well buy macbook. And because ipados limitations and lack of IO without having to use dongles it just makes everything more complicated and hassle than just using macbook which has everything already build-in and more freedom to install whatever apps without being limited to the app store and access to the full file system. No one literally needs this 😅 very niche device Due to less <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/PAJ1XsOOI4fegwOo57ewAg\"></a> budget I bought iPad 9th gen 1month ago and now they dropped the price of 10th gen 😥 Apple compare M4 to M2 because M3 is faster than M4. Now waiting for other company&#39;s to make their double oled layers screen. Sweap big screen on laptop for small 13 Inch hmm no no.  Min 17inch hope for 20 inch in future. We need a Bend test &quot;Why I bought it&quot; to flex that you have more money that us. 😂 Ipad 9&gt;&gt;&gt; It wont replace your laptop. The ipad doesnt have a keyboard and can&#39;t be propped up by itself. Trash Don&#39;t forget that you are supposed to make a smartphone better than Iphone PWAs are the future of apps and apple is ruining it. Does it have a calculator ? I love the new  background Great time to buy older iPads now 🔥 This makes the previous iPad Pro more satisfying 🎉🎉🎉 I bought a robot vacuum cleaner and it came with a small remote. I was disappointed that it wasn’t controllable from an app on my phone. I’d much rather have an app. You’re way more brainwashed than I expected 😂 I think apple made a mistake by releasing the m1, m2, m3 etc too quickly. Apple used to have a decent re-sale value when it was the 2015, 2012 etc. now i think the&#39;ve tanked the re-sale on the older m2 macs and could potentially put the next wave of buyers off. That toothbrush part <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> looks sussy It&#39;s mad that Arun is quickly catching up with MKBHD on subscriber count. Bro earned from his expense Imagine buying products from one of the greediest companies in the world. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s thinner than paper, I wouldn&#39;t even pay 10% of that criminal price for this overhyped Netflix watching device. I used to like Apple when I was younger but for the past 5+ years they just seem to test the limits of how much their cult like fanbase are willing to over pay for anything with an Apple sticker slapped onto it. Shameless scam from one of the greediest companies out there if you ask me. I wait for the day they fly too close to the sun, and fall off harder than Blackberry did, altho I don&#39;t see that happening any time soon unfortunately. I use my ipad as a daily driver as a student. I have had the ipad pro m1 128 gigs with keyboard and pencil for so long now might as well buy a Macbook Pro 😂 Well since you don&#39;t need your Mac I&#39;ll take it off your hands lol You talk about being able to use your tablet without touching the screen, isn&#39;t that the whole point of a tablet or one of the major points? Why not just get a laptop at that point? Speaking as someone who uses an iPad everyday at home as a sort of combination book/video split-screen player and LOVES the handoff feature so I can keep reading on my phone as I leave the house and transfer right back when I get home.. yes. You will have to buy an iPhone. Sorry. Arun where did you get your chair. You need a laptop for video editing, we need a laptop for coding, we are not the same bro.<br><br>As powerful as it is in terms of numbers, for most people it&#39;s just an overpowered Netflix machine. Obviously it&#39;s a laptop replacement that would make sense for you because your use case for a laptop is primarily video editing, but for most people it&#39;s still far from being able to accomplish work related tasks whether it&#39;s because of architectural limitations and OS limitations. <br><br>Now a cool concept would be a hybrid between iPadOS and MacOS, like how Windows 8&#39;s &quot;touch mode&quot; worked, allowing you to switch on the go. Far too uncritical. It&#39;s obvious that the iPad is basically useless for anyone who doesn&#39;t draw with the Apple Pencil. iPadOS is the biggest limitation and makes the device almost useless and completely overpriced. Google docs on ipad is still bad tho... For some reason commands for adding footnotes do not work along with some other things... and that&#39;s a big issue for people who are deep into word processing (like lawyers etc). still no native calculator app, why? An ipad is not a macbook. ipadOS sucks for productivity. period. The thermal throttling will be crazy 🥵 ⭐️⭐️ They should make a Smart Folio for the iPad Pro 13 inch like it’s with the 10th generation since I got the logi combo touch and it’s nice but I just want apple to make it for better quality and I hope they make it… Os is still ipad OS though, Why would I buy this instead of a full fledged MacBook with a better OS I would say the iPad Pro is totally worth it for the specs you don&#39;t need, at least for 99.9% of the buyers. I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s good only for artists and people who require to do video shooting and editing on the go. Obviously for techies and people who has money to spend to experience the latest and greatest, as there is a difference in experience in screen and pencil tech. If I was 15 years younger I&#39;d get one just for the tech as well. But today, I&#39;ve become an average user with average needs. A MacBook Air + iPad mini has become the perfect combo for me. I&#39;m still using the iPad mini 5 btw, and still great for media consumption (no gaming) You can buy a  gaming laptop with crazy on that price btw which I think would be better. Nothing beats that Samsung S24 Ultra IPad is the best @Mrwhosetheboss i hope u take a look at samsung tabs because what apple does wrong samsung does good for example Spen housing is much better solved, could be interesting video You get into ipad initially thinking it is freeing. Most people do. After the honeymoon you can see the frustrations building. You will start missing the versatility and stability offered mac or pc. The lack of solid external drive support really made me disappointed. And your life become hanging and juggling through docks and adapters.🙄 Mrwhosetheboss are you okay man? you look kinda sad 😕 Until ipad can run Mac OS, I won&#39;t ever buy a new one. Using my ipad pro to do anything serious is infuriating. I prefer Android to iOS, so why the hell do I need a giant BS iphone!? 😂 I actually loved the scene in this video. Great work guys! The fact that you cant have more than 1 instance of an app is a deal breaker for me. And power point sucks ,screenshot to your clipboard doesnt exist. Just so very inflexible to use! I really don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d pay that much money when you can just buy a more powerful PC with a removable screen Apple fanboys are starting to be like christians. They hate everyone and everything that&#39;s not stamped by Apple.<br>People can like both. And each has it&#39;s pros and cons. I cannot wait for this review. My main questions about Apple products remains.<br>Why so much money on a tablet, when a surface is way cheaper, even with a keyboard and a pen. And you are always forced to buy their (expensive) products. And yes, even the surface pro is too expensive considering the what the top phones do. There the same no one is buying apple products alone for a useless oled panel tablet that should have been years ago like come on now I would love to see the iPad tested with Goodnotes.<br>I use a 2021 standard iPad with Goodnotes for school and I am very happy, except the size because I have to zoom in to be able to handwrite… I need a new iPad, maybe it’s time to bite the bullet In Australia here Arun,just specced one out to the max with pencil and keyboard $5277 AU! bro please gift me a ipad😭 Dude what u do is just basic, just buy it or use some outdated ipad, it will work for your use case Man didn&#39;t just sneak his wedding announcement in😊😊😊 There’s only thing I’m drawing with an Apple Pencil. Please don&#39;t expect me to have sympathy for you being able to afford this tablet. There are still PDF files that can only be edited with a Mac and not on an iPad. Even with Adobe Premium. It’s frustrating, especially when I don’t have a laptop with me and only an iPad. Is there a work around to this that Google hasn’t been revealing to me? Until legacy computing is obsolete which will happen eventually. These ARM devices can never replace PCs and Macs (Macs have their own problems now that they&#39;re exclusively running on ARM). iPads are still in a losing battle because they&#39;re now needlessly using an inferior OS for no reason other than to keep both Macs and iPads alive. Can certain people use an iPad for everything? Sure, but there will ALWAYS be that one thing you do that won&#39;t work on the iPad or a different tablet. I&#39;m not even talking about things like gaming here or niche stuff like server management. For an example, look at browser extensions. If you&#39;re going to be using a tablet like a laptop, odds are you&#39;re going to be using the browser sometimes. You probably have extensions you rely on. On Android, there are janky third party solutions to get those extensions but not on the default Chrome browser. Assuming Apple doesn&#39;t even touch the word &quot;janky,&quot; there&#39;s probably nothing like it for iPad OS. Lots of things you can’t do on an iPad yet. I run lasers, so no Lightburn, no Silhouette, no Google Chrome extensions.. just to name a few. Basically most of the things I do on my Macbook aren’t even some version of an option on iPad. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=451\">7:31</a> samsung should start using snapdragon x elite or plus on their table Now to wait for jerry to snap it in half Vs tooth pick You only need a subscription for every app you use on the iPad....

I need access to the command line interface via terminal for remote server administration and the ability to ssh into network infrastructure (firewalls, routers, switches, etc.) <br><br>I’m super impressed with what Apple put together for his new release but wish they would finally let us use the full-on computer they’ve built to its potential (and they way we both want and need) <br><br>If a computer is a bicycle for the mind, then the iPad is still  one of those rides in front of the mall you put in quarters so your niece can pretend she’s a big girl. I bot an ipad and it lasted for a week. I rarely use it anymore Can I get that😢I love drawing I just ordered one too. 256 13” pro. And a pencil. I also have a remarkable  AND a SuperNote <br><br>I just like writing. I watch a lot of content and although I can do that on MacBook, I’m more concerned for MacBook safety and iPad…<br><br>sometimes I’m working on a car, motorcycle, woodworking, or cooking or some kind of project where MacBook is just too fragile. Im always concerned something will fall on keyboard and whole laptop is ruined. But iPad, I’ll put on rugged case and I’m fine. <br><br>When I’m outside is kinda weaker point cuz screen isn’t as easy to see but then I’ll just use 1 of the e ink tablets Squeezing the pen makes a menu pop up? That sounds amazing, sounds like something Samsung should have done years ago 🤔 so the quetion is why you buy an ipad set with all the macbook functions? Or you could buy a 2 in 1 laptop, having access to both a real OS that can do more that watching youtube and do all the iPad stuff at the same time. Less battery life? yeah but what use is more battery life on an oversized iPhone? And yes you can do all of those android apps thanks to the magic of VMs Honestly, even if it is POSSIBLE to replace a laptop just with its raw specs and usability, it&#39;s not enough to justify the price point. A tablet for 3000+ pounds or 4000+ USD if you include the accessories???? That HAS to be a fking workstation + gaming rig replacement if you want to justify that price point. Like seriously, with some good deals, I could build a damn good desktop with that money and still have leftover money to get a decent laptop enough for any on-to-go work I might need to do 🤣🤣 Maybe even throw in budget tablet just for watching Youtube or playing some light games, which I am more likely to be doing on my tablet anyway than editing 4k videos or something. Isn&#39;t it better value just to get the mac air at that price? Hi Arun! Have you ever tryed Linux? I don&#39;t think you would like it but it would make for an interesting video! Y don&#39;t they just make a Mac touch screen and add bit functionality...... I&#39;m 45 years old and even I consider Apple products to be products for the boomers. It&#39;s oversimplified garbage; and you bought one because you&#39;re a boy-fan. it&#39;s like a Ferrari that can reach 350 km/h put you will only go 120 km/h ever. Its so thin it can cut off your finger😂 Pun, pun, pun, puuuun.... 🤡 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=594\">9:54</a> except some software is 10x worse on iPad Very specific apps that 95% people not gonna experience anytime soon He is paid to say that he never uses iPad or iPhone for work Me watching this on my 7-year-old iPad like 👁👄👁 that smart brush b roll.. The ipad is probably the best apple product <br>Except for the locked down os which will have new app stores in 6 months <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=344\">5:44</a> &quot;Wow&quot; Basically touchscreen nerfed MacBook. Lots of folks have tried this. iPad OS file handling will be your undoing. &quot;How ugly do you want the Ipad Pro 4 background to be?&quot;<br><br>Apple: Yes Apple usually picks some nice backgrounds... This one is a stinker. Yeah no. Fuck apple product prices Now just imagine if Apple makes a 2 in 1 device. I will buy it (once it’s affordable) just to watch Netflix and youtube on it because it has a gorgeous OLED screen. I will also edit videos on it etc but mostly watch content 😁 iPad battery life is still disappointing by current MacBook standards AS &#39;SnazzyLabs&#39; Quinn said. The M1 chip, yeah, a HUUUUGE improvement over the Intel chip at the time, but Apple are experiencing &#39;Diminishing returns&#39; with their chips. As each generation goes, (it&#39;s ONLY only in it&#39;s 4th gen now!) They are going to see less and less in performance/efficiency gains! At some point &#39;Soon&#39; they&#39;re going to have to decide, ramp up the input power (and expect higher temps and less battery life), or make the chip physically bigger (and expect higher temps and less battery life)...<br>😎🇬🇧 Nah. I would get a heavier iPad if the battery was longer lasting. No wall hugger for me. I was planning to replace my 12.9&quot; M1 (512GB 5G) but the new iPad Pro is underwhelming. Lets look at why: <br>1. The 512GB and less models are 25% slower (Only 3 P. Cores)  This is the top of the range model in the iPad family. Why have they used pixel binned SOCs?<br>2. Having to purchase a new pencil and Magic Keyboard - No thanks <br>3. My Phone has OLED and yeah, its good but £2000+ good? Nope. <br>4. The Magic keyboard has had the Maclike gestures for years .<br>5. As much as I enjoy iPadOS and can do 95%+ of what I need to do on it, its still frustrating at times. And I often dock mine with a Caldigit Dock, ultrawide, Mechanical keyboard and MX Master and have got used to Stage Manager, but its still inferior to Dex on my Fold 4. (I dock that too :) ) <br>The iPad Pro needed to add a second TB4 port. <br>I am  waiting for the new Samsung S10 Ultra.  I&#39;m hoping the new SOC its rumoured to have will be as fast as M4. <br><br>I can work very well on my iPad Pro,and from experience  you are fooling yourself if you think you will replace a Macbook with one. <br><br>Still I love how many &quot;influencers&quot; have ordered one for their Youtube/Social Media and no doubt most will be returned once they have uploaded their content. It’s sad to see how Apple can’t keep up with their top position (I’ve been using exclusively Apple products for 15 years and am also own some shares). Lol, i found a apple fan boy after a lot of time. @@Abu_Tuesday unfortunately, I am :( @BrandonLeProktor a ce niveau demande le feat But it&#39;s still an ios I absolutely disagree! Having an app literally for everything I use is the most annoying thing! Websites are way more convenient, they don’t take up space abs don’t make my phone phone look like a cluttered mess! That thigs gonna snap like the 15 pro max😂😂 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=600\">10:00</a> eh no. Whenever a company directs me to their “app” rather than their website, it’s usually a dreadful waste of shoestring code in an attempt to get more data on me. Just look at the British Airways “app” which pretends to be an app while it mostly just loads a web browser with limited functionality The only ipad you should buy is the cheapest one. And only for your toddler. Nah, I’m fine with my $30 onn tablet… That was the most far from reality review I&#39;ve ever seen. The Ipad is still limited by its OS, and nothing on your routine needs has been improved by the new one,  compared to the old model. Why isn&#39;t there a video praising the functionality of the m2 ipad, or the m1 air,  that endorses the possibility of it become a one-and-only design? Ipads are still toys, as any other tablets. I absolutely prefer my MacBook Pro to my iPad. I just keep dreaming of Apple adding touch, pen, and 360 hinge to MacBook Pro... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=337\">5:37</a> Iwas laughing too😂. The M4 chip will help me watch YouTube with less lag yay! I literally made this decision a couple of months ago with the Huawei platform. Best decision I have ever made ! So many 1st world problems for the 1% in one go I can’t keep up 😂 I at least expected to have an ipad in your hand ... but its a horrible click bait OMG :/ Did any one notice bros window? Where iPad will never replace macs.  Developers, product designers. Basically all tech people in all IT industries of the world. <br>I spent 1 week using figma on my iPad. Nightmare. <br>Unless they change the OS and somehow make pc apps work too. New iPads are pretty boring tbh. Just a better version of the older ones. The iPad is still no alternative to a MacBook because of ipad os I&#39;ve replaced almost all my tech, including multiple iPads, Macbook, and iPhone, with a Galaxy Fold 5 and touchscreen laptop dock. One device capable of going from one of the most one-hand friendly phones on the market, to mini-tablet/ereader, to full size tablet and touchscreen laptop, to 80&quot; smartboard in a classroom,  without signing into an app more than once or pay for more than one set of internals. iOS has an advantage in software, and performance, but the new iPads are frankly still just perfected 2010s tech and nothing like the experience of a true single device experience that the 2020s deserve. Add to that how Android has an actual desktop browser, niche as Kiwi might be, and these new iPads no longer interest me who was once one of the biggest supporters of iPads. No matter how good it actually is, im not paying that absurd apple tax for a tablet of all things.<br>Holy hell thats almost 3 grand. Wtf... I’ll do 2 push ups for every like this comment gets… That’s why i bought iPad Pro…. One year later. Huge mistake. iPad os can never beat laptop … so many limitations. It’s just a YouTube Netflix device with occupational PowerPoint ppts which are good that one shot were he was shoving the toothbrush down his throat had me dead 😂😂<br><br>edit 1 misspelled he lol <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=216\">3:36</a> &quot;I can neither confirm nor deny&quot;---- Now that is definitely concerning sir xD <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=17\">0:17</a> Huh??? £2,877 For a tablet?? This tablet really is something The first time I’ve heard this guy say the word iPad No matter how you explain am stuck with what&#39;s M4... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=434\">7:14</a> game name pls I thinks it’s Diablo immortal @@YouFoundMee thanx bruh It&#39;s not going to replace Remarkable bro all love u have become a tech documenter over a review guy i dont unsubscribe cuz of the love i had for the old u. Where is the hands on? I&#39;m very disappointed. Just talking and presentation on the back ground. The &#39;Anti-reflective&#39; screen coated versions - according MKBHD - neuters the famous OLED &#39;Pure Inky/jet blacks&#39; to be more like LCD grey/black colours, and, aint as sharp in detail as the regular screen too. So, NOT ONLY do you NEED a SPECIFIC cleaning cloth for this screen (not to damage it), but, how will a iPencil affect it also?... Probably not very well... And it&#39;s a £/$100 option!!! &quot;Apple is as Apple does...&quot; 😏🤣🤣🤣<br>😎🇬🇧 I think the Achilles heel will be the battery life...(And the price obviously) iglad I watched this to the end :) The only reason you would get an iPad is for the nostalgic home button... Thats the only reason I have one, but I barely use it. Just spend your money on something that has more value like the tab s9 ultra, but if you already sold both your kidneys like me get a tab s9 fe+ is this how all apple consumers cope? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=631\">10:31</a> “They Not Like us” Kendrick Lamarr Reference wait how? And still no simple calculator 😂 Which tablet is he using right now? The one he is talking about replacing with ipad Smart toothbrush😂😂. And the way he&#39;s moving his hand😂 Powerful tech with fisher price os imagine watching a product review without seeing the actual product in the hands of reviewer<br>Click baits have evolved Does it have a calculator in 2024 ? Why make it so expensive though. Anyone know what that game Arun played around the midpoint is? Would you give me 1 ipad 🥺 Beggar I am sorry, but I cannot agree to this.<br>1. The main thing is that hardware is unmatched, absolutely outstanding. It&#39;s just that iPad OS is the main limiting factor.(This may be subject to change after WWDC)<br>2. If you aren&#39;t a graphic designer, an artist, or anyone needing a pen and notebook for their professional work, the Apple Pencil pro really does not give you any real benefit over the standard Pencil 2.<br>3. Apple hasn&#39;t really fundamentally changed anything about the iPad Pro. They did things no one asked for, (Apart from the function rows of the Magic Keyboard, that is something nice). The iPad&#39;s display was already brilliant, especially the mini led. I don&#39;t think anyone thought the iPad Pro was thick or heavy(The old Magic Keyboard is different though). I would say the M2 was already an extremely capable chip. I don&#39;t think anyone thought it was slow, even for the pro apps(correct me if I am wrong).<br>4. You can get 90% of what the M4 iPad Pro is offering in an M1 iPad Pro. And considering the price jump that apple just did, the M1 is better deal for me.<br>5. The &quot;Pro Apps&quot; on iPad OS are nerfed ones from the Mac.<br><br>This is my perspective of what is going on. The new iPad&#39;s are brilliant, it&#39;s just that they aren&#39;t justifiable for an upgrade from a previous iPad Pro(I am talking about 3rd generation or later). The reason I am being so harsh on iPad OS is that Apple markets this tablet as a computer replacement, and for most people iPad OS would be fine. But you are really just better off with a Mac unless you really need a touch screen.<br><br>Arun&#39;s ideas are amazing though, not gonna lie. I never had really thought of the iPad Pro as what Arun described, especially the cellular part(but I might just be better off using my phones wireless hotspot) The new &#39;Ultra thin&#39; iPads... I see a &#39;JerryRigEverything&#39; durability/bend test coming soon... iPhone6 &#39;Bendgate&#39; anyone? 😏😉🤣🤣🤣   😎🇬🇧 I will not be buying one based on my experience with ipad Air 4. My biggest problem with iPad is keyboard including  the build-in virtual keyboard, the handwriting key board and the external keyboard. My logitech keyboard worked well until recently in which certain keys are not working. There was nothing wrong with the keyboard as it works well with my laptop and android devices. The handwriting keyboard is also problematic. When I highlight text, the handwriting keyboard disappears. To get it back I have to close and reopen the file. That is very frustrating. I had years of experience with samsung and huawei tablets and I have not had such a problem. I love ipads especially the bigger ones I&#39;ve had about three the only problem I have with them is if you constantly pick it on the corner there&#39;s a lot of stress put on the the screen as it&#39;s so thin and sure this is what&#39;s happened to my last ipads it was always the screen that broke Gaming on an iPad sucks as well. Come on, you&#39;ll say anything now. No matter what hardware you put inside, the only thing holding back the iPad is the iPadOS. iPads got better chips to do what most budget laptops do since M1 and nothing drastic or new happened with M4 iPads. iPads are not going to replace laptops for all because again, no matter what, they are mobile chips with few wH, this will always keep being a hurdle in adoption of iPads as an alternative to PC and talking about games, well... RISC is good and efficient but CISC is much more mature and development is easy for CISC. Still if you just look at the raw performance of the Intel or AMD (any CISC based chip) and compare it with an equivalent RISC chip, you will find them beating RISC. I personally am great admirer of RISC architecture but some things are simply just too vague to claim atm. This new iPad is good but still the biggest problems with iPads remains... it&#39;s not the chip, it&#39;s the operating system... it&#39;s the iPasOS. Really redesigned??? I don&#39;t know if this has ever been asked.. but is it apple or Mkb... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=962\">16:02</a> <a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/HvgfY93GEYmqvwLUuYDwAQ\"></a> Such a Fanboy.....3600 USD nothing for him man I remember youtubers saying the same thing about ditching laptops with the last pro ipad. But they quickly changed their mind because the OS sucks. the ipad is really great but sooooo expensive 😭😭 I&#39;m going to sell my kidneys 😂🤣 makes a case for the surface pro really, the only downside is the chip. 2 months later: I was wrong - iPad cannot replace my MacBook And cracked screen will cost arm and leg @@dragm2123Screen will be fine I bet, but in the Apple event you can already see people holding new iPads, and they are bent. Yeah... no... &quot;Why I just bought it.&quot; Because I can afford it. Ironic that someone can afford a device because they can describe it to the majority of people who cannot afford it! you are not gonna switch 🤷🤦 I just realized that I am listening to a sh*t. This entire video is all about him and his life and opinions. Its not really helpful for the regular consumer that doesn&#39;t have an entire Jarvis AI powered home. Just 300K more for beating the Apple yt channel, lets gooo! I&#39;ve still got my M1 ipad pro and the thing I hate the most is the aspect ratio for watching videos and shows. The amount of empty black space on the 13&quot; looks so ridiculous Thank you for sharing your great insights 🤙🍻 Just use a pen and paper damn ☠️☠️☠️ I know people complain about apple prices but they are a business….if you own a business you are looking to make profits…plus nobody is forcing anyone to buy apple products 😂😂😂😂😂 people talk about apple product they complain but then they are the first people to buy it . I have always used android phones last year a switched to apple and I must say best decision ever It is my mac replacement Why? It&#39;s called consumerism Bro is rosting samsung tablets Yes why carry a tablet, when you can do much more with a phone especially with the folding phones that can literally be turned into a tablet  but can be carried as normal compact phone. Its always exaggerated until some months goes by... Wake me up when apple will decide to merge the laptop with the tablet software. The hardest part is the will to give up all the money from all of the shepple that are buying all that it&#39;s Apple! MAYBE JUST USE A SAMSUNG BOOK 4 PRO 360............... LOW PRICED TOUCHSCREEN AND WAY BETTER &#39;&#39;/ Bend test ? Glass is glass and glass breaks !!! You just bought it because they are not going to send you a review unit this time?? 1000 dollars merely for the brand name. Hell no . There goggles failed so now there going to try and sail an iPad for $3600 . <br><br>Apple is losing sells <br><br>Apple - let’s increase the price even more . <br>Damn I like apple but this company is getting more and more stupid You have the price wrong. $3600? Where did you get that from? im a 8 tb kind of guy 💀 Why not just put mac os in it , maybe modified so ppl still buy macbooks Rocking my M1 Ipad Pro, crying I can&#39;t get this one 😂! But in all seriousness, as an artist, its pretty for an &quot;update&quot;, but I dont see myself upgrading over mine. Yet the new features look nice. respect man. Love your videos man When apple stops being cringe about storage costing hundreds to THOUSANDS of dollars extra ill consider it. There&#39;s no reason a 256 gb to 512gb should cost $350 extra...the 256 is $2199 Australian dollars and the 2tb is $3949. That&#39;s JUST the storage. What a joke. that&#39;s one of the many reasons i don&#39;t buy apple products, as cool as this is. picture this <br>you study technical chemics/maths/physics. how you gonna take notes? (hint: not with a keyboard) how you gonna train calculating?<br>1000sheets of paper per year (30€ + pens)<br>or a graphic pad (60€) that you can USB to your laptop (500€) (which btw feels a lot better to write on than an IPad and lasts like 5 times longer) and lets you use a proper OS<br>or an IPad (3000€) + pen (200€) + charger (200€) + a backpack with 10kg of protective stuff for the ipad (200€) + apple care bc you very well know that thing breaks regardless (+500€) + an Iphone bc youre now in the eco system ( probabaly 2000€ too idgaf) + a mac and an apple watch (2000€+500€) + apple care for those (500€) + additive constant for apple things i may have missed or features that may get added in the future (5000€) + dongles (prolly 100€ too) + chargers for phone,mac,watch (300€) + probabaly apple care for the chargers and dogles too (50€) + inscription fees for uni of arts (0€) bc you just got thrown out the scientific one for failing that iq test.<br><br>... i forgot where i was going with this tbh. do you guys think, that if i stick a apple sticker on my 5 dm³  300k€ Cs watch that i will look as premium and rich as 75% of americans? (I always use three of those to tell if one is off) Yeah, nice publicity, but my old iPad Air is still good. Sold out again. Finally you can afford M1 or M2 IPads 👻🤩🤭 Ok, looking forward to your review after you daily drive it to replace your macbook air and e-ink tab for 2 months. They even freaking mentioned moving that front facing camera to the landscape side as feature 😪 i think if you find yourself needing to buy a keyboard for your iPad then really what you needed was a laptop! Damn. Apple is going crazy with this pricing model. thank you, sir, you didn&#39;t answer my Christmas Emai love all that you do, and thanks for this awesome video they need to combine ipad os with macos for the ipad to reach the next level.

OR at least add touchscreen and pencil support on new MacBooks. But my main question is @Mrwhostheboss, where do I get one of those sweaters? Looks super comfy! iPad has Final Cut Pro but it does not have Premiere Pro or After Effects. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=602\">10:02</a> worst take of my life waiting for the jerryrigeverthing bend test &quot;Apple&#39;s genius lies in its ability to charge exorbitant prices for minor tweaks, making customers feel like they&#39;re getting a steal of a deal every time they empty their wallets.&quot; &quot;We were living in a PC first world and swapping your laptop for an iPad, it would be seen as a move only filthy casuals would make&quot;. That line took me the FUCK out, who knew Arun was so funny 🤣🤣 As someone who has a MacBook pro, iphone and an iPad I can with 100% guarantee say I haven’t touched my iPad in probably years, the Mac is so much faster when using for video editing, music editing or any heavy software stuff while any other stuff my I need to do my iPhone handles it, sure the case could be made that the iPad is the start of the 2 in 1 phone and laptop but we’re probably 10 years or even more behind in apple development years to getting to that point of making it work, I genuinely think this is a niche product for certain group of people, however it’s a start from apple that can change the iPad section forever. &quot;I always feel wayy better when a product tells me to use their app, than when they direct me to their website&quot; what kind of a twisted psychopath are you Arun! 😂 This idea that IOS can be your main OS was really loud when the 11&#39;&#39; ipad came out. <br>Lots of promises, but they didn&#39;t deliver. <br>Not. Even. Close. puns are getting worse but a sub is ieasy :p For some reason, even though you produce fantastic impartial qualityful movies, when it comes to Apple items, you sound a little biased or fanboying a tiny bit over their product. It should just have the macOS, it has the hardware for it ... and it has still the garbage ipadOS, does not have any good app for file handling .. Once I tried to bring only my ipad to a holiday to backup my photos from my camera, and it just wasn&#39;t be able to format the external drive ... I said ok, backup to another SD, let&#39;s select today&#39;s shots ... and I couldn&#39;t, it didn&#39;t have the feature to select a day&#39;s photos, but was able to group as days ... the most annoying OS I ever met, it would be a dream to use as a photographer if they would be able to solve file managing, but now it is only a good piece of metal to draw on :( Can you imagine Microsoft unable to produce close to apple... i mean any product... full garbage when there is windows issue we need troubleshoot and find solution by googling by right microsoft need come with solution and simplified it.. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=114\">1:54</a> not a full on computer.😢<br>A disabled tablet with noway to utilize it full potential 😢 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> really showing us who the real boss is dude 😂😂😂 @@niravparmar7856 😂😂😂😂 💀 What 💀 😂😂😂😂 i came looking for the toothbrush comment.

Definitely gonna buy one, whatever the price will be. I never had a dream of buying these gadgets as my dreams can&#39;t afford it and in reality using 3 year potao phone to watch this......... Good night Arun.. Nice video btw.. Trust me, I&#39;ve been an ipad user since the Ipad 2nd gen, even before I started using smartphones. Whenever I try to do work on an Ipad, such as using Google Docs or Canvas or Google Sheets, the functionality just isnt there. Everything is simplified to the point you can&#39;t really get a detailed result without an actual computer. They might add this gadget and that feature to the Ipad, some apps might even have all features as those on a fonputer, but overall it is a pain in the ass to work with and is so time consuming.<br><br>If you need a tablet to watch videos and play games, Ipads are overkill and great at it. If you need to do light loads on the go, Ipads are a viable option. But if you really wanna get work done, you better still keep a computer, because Ipads are just impostors trying to replace computers to no avail, at least for all these years its been this way. As always people hate what they can’t afford. I don’t know why they expect apple to be cheap. It has always been expensive. And the same people who are complaining have an iPhone and all. Spoiler: He wont replace his laptop. Reason: iPad OS. ( Unless they update it soon). I sold myself the same lie he is selling himself a while ago. The hardware isn&#39;t the problem. Its the software They need to be able to run macOS for anyone to consider them a laptop replacement. iPadOS is way too limited for most workflows I found it ridiculous that you iPad air is heavier I&#39;m thicker than the pro. All these are decent argument to buy an iPad, just not a reason to buy newest M4 iPad in particular, any modern iPad will deliver similar enough experience. Laptop replacement? Lol, because you are replacing a MacBook. If you use a Windows laptop, you can’t replace like that easily unless you’re a boring user who won’t be gaming and no freedom to use the system. I tried this whole iPad instead of laptop and notebook. In my opinion you still 100% need a laptop (Mac or windows) alongside the iPad. iPads are fantastic for notes. All I’ve used this year is my iPad for college and I’ve never felt more productive. All my notes in one place. Yet some tasks were just not plausible on the iPad (with the Magic Keyboard), like doing an assignment on Word or PowerPoint. But Arun, run an experiment for yourself to debunk this. My experience could be different to yours. I did this. I got an iPad when I was in university to draw and take notes. For doing any sort of coursework or typing, you need a laptop. The Folio keyboard didn&#39;t cut it, the feel wasn&#39;t the same, window management wasn&#39;t good etc. You could do it, but why, when there&#39;s a better option there. For gaming? PCs/Macs and consoles exist with actual hardware controls (so a controller or mouse and keyboard). Yes, you can use bluetooth to connect them to your iPad, but then you&#39;re restricted by the hardware inside that tablet (not so much now with the M chips) and the software whereas for big games the PC and console exist. That&#39;s changing now, but you&#39;re restricted by screen size then on an iPad. For mobile games, the smartphone exists and it&#39;s more portable and better suited for gaming on the move. If you don&#39;t want that, the Switch and Steam Deck exist.<br><br>So outside of YouTube and light browsing (assuming you don&#39;t draw, take notes or photo/video edit), what is it good for? A computer and a phone are more general purpose so you&#39;ll likely find something to use them for I love how, when discussing doing work on a device, literally all youtubers talk about video and photo editing, as if that is what we all work on. 😂 Right?? That&#39;s what I was thinking lol that&#39;s because that&#39;s the workflow they&#39;re most familiar with The only thing I’ll do is use discord, play Roblox, and watch YouTube @@jaydenleckpa8381 iPad 10 be like Exactly 💯. Youtubers think the pro use case is photo and video editing mostly. Agreed. They even run benchmarks on how quickly a bit of kit will export video...a use case for a tiny minority of users Because it showcases the over all speed of the device Its because this is specifically targeted to people who review these devices. They do edit videos, so they will appreciate it and hype about it. Very sneaky marketing. Well to be honest that is really the best application for it. Wow they are talking about what the device is made for, thats bad I never do video editing on my ipad, i never do photoshop images on my ipad, i never use office tools on my ipad,… i just browse the web, look through my email, watch youtube and a bit of facebook. For me this ipad is utterly nonsensical. For other tasks i can not use the ipad: programming arduino, writing some silly pc programs. So no, certainly at this price point, a big no for me So this the thing big and small YouTubers discuss this because this it what they use it there content creator they CREATE CONTENT so it makes sense be honest do you really need to know how fast Netflix app opens or how smooth the safari runs if so go to smaller channel that uses it the way you would use it you wouldn’t go to karate class and expect to learn yoga. I hate to tell you but most not all do want to know how fast can a project render how smooth is creating graphics design or sound design @@manojgailThe iPad Pro was designed for artists, editors and application developers. It has MANY other LITTLE perks that other people may enjoy, but they are minuscule. If you are not a creator and you are purchasing the iPad Pro instead of purchasing the iPad, then you mid as well set your money on fire. The capabilities that these creators are going over are the biggest changes between the last version and this version, it is extremely important for many of us to know what we are purchasing before we do so because we don’t want to get a machine that won’t work with our type of art style. If you are interested in this because of how thin it is, again, the normal iPad is the same thickness- buy that and save your money.

There are so many other use cases that almost everybody prefers to do them on a pc, not because these devices are weak, but because the OS is not what they need. I am doing video editing, coding, casual music production, and graphics design. But all of those aren&#39;t my job (yet). What I know is that Excel on iPad is unusable because it doesn&#39;t support pivot tables. I also know that the Office suite on iPad sucks.

For a tech guy that occasionally needs to plug ethernet to configure a network, that codes, test and creates programs, that have 3 monitors and actually use everyone of them, that use his laptop to flash isos and format drives to use with other machines... well the ipad it&#39;s just a portable monitor, you will always need a basic windows or mac laptop around. bro u just need smart toilet Its still a PC heavy world where using a phone/tablet instead is still being looked down as casual user only behavior.The only features where phone/tablets are better is entertainment due to being able to use them in your bed to watch something.Portability too i guess but laptops still exist Title: “why I bought it”<br><br>Because you’re a tech reviewer and this’ll give you a lot of clicks.

These super inflated prices are like what potato PC&#39;s use to be back when they first started to roll out in to peoples homes. THIS is why i dont get angry at people who just like apple because of its features and ecosystem. i get it man, i really do, but there are people that praise apple for everything it does ever, and look really stupid when apple continues to do garbage business practices, and they just ignore it or dont acknowledge it, as if they know that doing so will make them look less credible. or who obsess over it and argue with other people who dont like apple because of said business practices. i hate apple because theyre unfathomably greedy and extremely stinky when it comes to how they handle their consumers, but i can recognize the pros of using apple devices in specific use cases. i myself may or may not eventually wind up buying an older iphone just so i can use the face tracking on it for 3d avatars, but thats literally it. So spend some 3500eur on iPad then some 700eur on keyboard and pen and you are set for next 12 months There is only one use case that might justify this thing and that is if you are an artist and you want to design with the pen and I am still not sure if you can&#39;t do that in something cheaper like iPad air. Any other ads showing doctors or engineers holding the thing, is just flexing. Real work is done in real production machines, desktops or powerful laptops. For starters, after so many years of developing this thing, they should have been able to put a proper OS to even consider it as a serious candidate.

I need to use other prgrams to do that....The new Ipad pro looks awesome but for this year I will actually choose MS Surface pro It&#39;s crazy how apple doesn&#39;t even put their computers in chronological order. Like 1st the M3 Max, then the normal M3, and then the M4? I think you got a winner here! The combination of less weight then a laptop + laptop performance + apps is the future Can&#39;t wait to hear your experience 15 percent weight drop is pretty great! for the 13 inch model only, the old 13 inch was too heavy for me I wonder if this solves my problem Thank you Mrwhosetheboss 👍👍👍👍😊😊 Mrwhoestheboss Just an Apple shill these days I can&#39;t wait for Jerry Rig with this one. This dude has a real hard-on selling the mobile app walled garden concept. Is this a product review or agitation propaganda piece? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=515\">8:35</a> : as someone who used to be a hardcore gamer and now only games very casually, my MacBook serves me just fine. The games that I care about (kerbal space program, cities skylines, planet coaster, and even no man’s sky) run perfectly fine on my M1 MacBook Pro. <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=603\">10:03</a> - this depends! I really dislike it when I have to install an app for something I could do perfectly well on a (mobile optimised) website! We are near to 18.9M Arun... Way to go! Angry birds would look good on it 😊 What about M3? The truth is that you could do about 95% of these things on the M1 iPad as well. Apple has excellent hardware but the software on the iPad has limited it to being just slightly more functional than a phone in most cases. Sure, digital art? Design? Yes it&#39;s excellent. But you go to do anything else and it&#39;s almost always compromised. They have the hardware, they should back it up with capable software. Can I have ur laptop then? 1234 You need that high fidelity for those cocomelons and roblox shenanigans, am i right? OF COURSE IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS...<br>IT&#39;S THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS!!<br><br>That&#39;s double the price of the Samsung flagship tablet. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=549\">9:09</a> what app is this ? U could buy a car instead of this 🍎 Better hide this from apple before they cut the ipad so everyone gotta go back to their 2k minimum macbooks😂 for storage you could consider a synology nas. The new Ipad pro is weird, I own a Macbook 3 pro and I really don&#39;t need that new Ipad pro, but I really do want it, the beautiful  screen for watching movies at night, the portability it&#39;s just great. What if s10 ultra comes with snapdragon X Elite.? I hope apple paid you well for the video and if they didn&#39;t, they should. Stop buying shit you don&#39;t need unless you are a influencer For the first i have seen Arun<br>Feeling difficult to get energy and explain it in his way Please Apple give us a new iPad mini No tablet is worth that much money. It tells a lot about innovation that the company with the best products also has the most inhuman planned obsolescence policy. Is the screen on the iPad manufactured by Samsung ? No, to do real work outside youtuber video editing, you can&#39;t replace a laptop or desktop with a tablet. biggest apple shill on youtube hypes the next obsolete gadget he will never use but praise to heavens Nah Aren is just justifying why he bought one when he actually doesnt even need one...Its a pointless purchase imo Coming from MKBHD , As a fan I must say Iam disappointed in your opinion because as Marques said the Ipad Pro m1 can basically do all these things and its almost 3 years old. A Big price tag for such small margins &quot;I would be cutting the size of my tech by about 5 times&quot; i would be cutting by the size by 27 houses if this replaces my 2017 gaming laptop You watched the Apple event? What is your current daily driver that toothbrush use 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 This video is so good, which camera did you use for this?? It’s amazing I had never thoughts about leaving my home with others than with my ipad. But it is the 11‘‘. Apart from the weight of the older M3, 13‘‘, size matters 😅 too for the new one…for me. Why am i even watching this?<br><br>I have never had an i pad <br><br>I am never going to never buy an i pad<br><br>I don&#39;t have the money to buy an i pad <br><br>My country is sanctioned as hell even if i had the mony and was interested i still couldn&#39;t buy an i pad<br><br>But i still click on very video about I am waiting for jerryrigeverthing. Why does noone talk about the removed camera? THE BEZELS ARE THICKER THAN THE WHOLE IPAD….L PRODUCT I’M EARLY! For a video that’s why you got one 😂 Can you giveaway your old remarkable table😊 Nope! iglad? lol.. He´ll be disillusioned by the restrictions and limitations of iPadOS. you bought it because you&#39;re rich. I m surprised by a low quality review. This 2024 I Pad Pro 11 and 13 inch lineup has 1 less speakers, does not have a 5 G MM waive length! So it does less for more money. Prior I Pad Pro has those features! Your review normally are pretty decent, but this one is very subpar. You just bought it bcz you can afford it 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I expect this man to use the ipad for the rest of his youtube career as his main rig 😭 Is like $6000 usd in my country 😢 This man took a whole day, compressing the video to 16 mins to 🐐 on Apple. No Arun, i like you Bro, but you know very well that the spec bump means nothing until they gave us the MacOS on an iPad. <br><br>Come on Bro, you are better than this. Phone processors are more than enough for a tablet that runs a phone software and does the same things.<br><br>It is a tablet fit with a computer processor that makes no sense.<br><br>I am pretty sure this M4 is basically the same as M3 but with some tweaks or overclocking, but they want to differentiate their laptops processors from now on. For that money yall can liyerally make a really OP gaming pc... Love how the sun goes down outside. I know a few tech YouTubers who would have waited until it’s dark before recording to have a consistent background. Like if you think Apple should make a real GAMING computer and get into gaming I don&#39;t know who tf sees a modern iPad Pro and thinks &quot;hmm, if only this was thinner&quot; Well, who else is watching this on an iPhone X, or I’m the only one?😅💔 Everyone knows it’s a good time when a new Apple product is getting released Did you use older M series iPads with their accessories? Just wait for the Galaxy Tab ultra with new snapdragon  laptop chip . It&#39;s oled just as thin and, most importantly, a 14.5-inch screen. The 16 x10 is also better for content consumption. They need to increase the size of the I pad to be your all in one. Everything else you said is true. My business work will involve more travelling soon and I want a device that can run my editing software, Da Vinci Resolve, but I don&#39;t want anything heavy or with a battery life that falls far too short. I recently learned the M-series iPads can get Da Vinci Resolve which is perfect and just what I need. Next year, I will jump from Android to iOS for the first time since 2015 so I can film on an iPhone and air drop to iPad than filming on my Pixel 8 Pro and having to upload to Google Photos and then download to my PC... I have very slow internet. The fact 95% of people who buy this will just watch vids and buy things online 😂 Dear Arun, please make a video review about other Android tablet as well ! 🙏💯 what is that song at the beginning? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4\">0:00</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=20\">0:20</a> , that is very familiar Microsoft surface 2017 anyone ?! Please someone buy me one. And I&#39;ll work 4 u for 1 month. As for it being light, I really do think this is an argument that most of us geeks need more exercise. tablets are a strange one there an in between of a phone and a laptop. But at the moment locked to using ipadOS/ android. would be interesting to see dual boot. Apple would never do it because they&#39;d rather sell you both but windows is already making a push for ARM support so maybe down the line we will see tablets that run windows Hey Arun bro this is was a really good video about the iPad use cases. But can you make a comparison video with the tab s9 ultra or other tabs to see if the extra price really matters ? Just get the 2020 one Ipad 10 th generation price cut<br>Guys what do you think why not just show the history of drawing on paper You forgot to write Paid Promotion You can use your iPad to add it in. Nice This iPad Pro will for sure give people the iPhone 6 flashbacks💀 i feel in this video you&#39;re trying very hard to justify ipad as macbook.<br>i agree it &#39;feels&#39; like laptop, but thats the catch, it only FEELS like laptop, not works like one I mean with apples track record of locking hardware and software. I can&#39;t ever image buying one for 3 grand. would love to learn about how you&#39;re going about planning your smart home Another option for extra storage is a NAS, LTT done a lot of videos and helped a lot youtubers set those up. It&#39;s your own private cloud that you don&#39;t have to pay montly subscription for. There are off the shelf plug-and-play options from the likes of synology, and there is the DIY route. DIY is no harder than building a PC and installing an OS on it, for the most part just Lego it together and write a bootable USB stick with something like TrueNAS, plug it in, go through the installer and off you go. The hardest part of the DIY route is probably making it accessible over the internet, for someone who never done it it&#39;s gonna be a learning experience (unless TrueNAS has some built in features and proxies for that, I don&#39;t know), but other than that it can be done in under an hour. And then you own the hardware, you own the software, no subscriptions or anything like that. Maybe some small fee for a proxy server and\\\\or domain name to make access to your NAS easier. 5.1 mm thin 🤔 someone bring out JerryRigg everything 😂 Welcome to the inner dialogue that every man has, trying to justify his upcomming techbuy that he really doesn&#39;t need 😅😅 An ipad cannot replace a computer. keep having slide up and switch apps and pages, less app flexibility and external device limitation. @Arun do you not remember bendgate 2018? ipads have been here before, i hope they made improvements the rigidity in comparison to last time. It’s a tax write off. Quit yapping bs Worst video you have released. Massively underplayed how limited the software, IPadOS is compared with a desktop OS. Also failed to criticise them for the massive $200 price hike. and still no DEX eperience... So much power in a great piece of hardware but I can be so much more productive with DEX on Samsung. Saved me a lot of time over the years. Jerry ain&#39;t liking this one Compare both Samsung galaxy tab ultra and iPad pro please 😂 Man these new shi has been on samsung tablets, surface pros and other gadgets for years now and it&#39;s cheaper lol Bend test? Please put it head to head with the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra Easy with the crappy music, trust your voice! iOS/iPadOS is really limiting compare to MacOS, I dunno who would use a tablet over a laptop. Are you really doing it? Or is it just &quot;replacing&quot; for a week or two?<br><br>Lots of people make decisions based on what YouTubers say in their videos and that would very hypocritical from you to say you will buy an iPad so you won&#39;t need the laptop anymore and not really doing it. <br><br>You have tons of money and you can buy dozens of Apple products anytime. Most of people who watch your videos don&#39;t. Think about it when you say things you don&#39;t really intend doing. Most of times i was wondering what Rohit sharma is doing in apple ipad review video 🤣🤣 Arun is a look alike of Rohit sharma. I’m using an Ipad Pro M1 now. I want to upgrade but will just wait until there will be more 2nd hand units in the market. I find it too expensive to buy it brand new. This was such a waste of your time that you did it in the comfort of your hotel room. Bet it took less then an hour to make this “goofy iPad” review video. Greed at its finest. Yayaya another expensive shit I can&#39;t afford It&#39;s sad when even apple fan boys can&#39;t fully justify this being a good product to buy now. “Small cars worth” my mercedes benz 380sec cost £3015 Too much, too little, too late. Bew i pad is like having a lion in a cage cause pratically its not good to use m4 on a tab Thank you, for a great and informative video. You give us insight, before we take the plunge. I must say that, I am still on the fence, in terms of pricing. But overall it seems to be a great product. <br>BTW, I don&#39;t know if you are aware that, you are now so close to beating Apple. Just 400,000 or so to go. Here comes the phone you promised to make 👍 If Apple is not careful, they might be in the position where Sony Xperia was back in 2014 with the Xperia Z1. It was so thin that it came with a manufacturing defect where the screen would brake (perceived as a thin line, almost like a hair on the screen) due to the phone being so thin and due to the phones heat, it would cause this issue. Will see what happens. It does always feel like the different apple products are all competing against each other almost as if they’re seperate businesses entirely I love Apple \\uf8ff The greatest tech YouTuber that ever lived ❤❤❤<br>Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩 £2800...you dont need it X Elite Surface Pro 10? Anyone? Sucker! A cheap Chinese brand android tablet (same price as pencil pro) can do more than this ipad pro regarding asseability (os) &amp; general normie use. <br><br>A Samsung galaxy book 4 360 Pro (not base model) is best of both worlds of laptop/tablet, bigger 16&quot; oled 3k screen with antiglare standard and cheaper with same specs than ipad pro WITHOUT keyboard or pencil pro. Also the IOS won&#39;t be supported on this for more than 6 years whereas the Samsung will work with latest windows until the processor simply isn&#39;t powerfull enough. The iPad kids getting a buff with this one 💀 Hahaha<br>iGlad! When it comes to storage, nas and zimaboard to organise your files, email, calendars, notes and so on. It will be a bit of an investment to start up but you will end up with reliable, easy to manage and upgrade, locally hosted and safe solution. Just give me m4 Mac mini Get a job kiddo This is obscene considering it costs as much as my macbook, and the reason is mostly for aesthetics! Tab S7 💪 def not buying it when my only use case is yt and anime. for work i like paper and pen I bought another useless tech that i already have. <br>Here&#39;s the new title 😅 You brought it to show off how rich you are. This is the untold reason. hmmm sunset Fun Fact: - video shoot took full day as it was light outside window at start and dark at the end. bros a master waffler Apple need to seriously consider give up ipadOS and put MacOS on ipad pro. Just use ipadOS on other models. Is the ipad considered an ipad anymore?? tax rightoff So, now that you won&#39;t be needing the MacBook, I will forward you my address to ship it!!!! 😂 apple vision pro so advance then apple went backwards with these😂 Hopefully one day we can run Xcode on an iPad Can&#39;t wait to sell my second fliter bean All this power and yet limited by IOS. Not sure if I&#39;m the only one— But I kinda like the &quot;clanky&quot; feel of using a PC, especially one running Windows. To me, it feels like part of the whole user experience which I like so much, and that&#39;s also why I find it hard or &quot;weird&quot; to switch to Apple, because everything is so &quot;round&quot; and &quot;smooth&quot;, very uncomfortably so. Yes, I will never deny how efficient and overall better their products are, but those same products remove this clanky feel I love so much (also, by clanky, I don&#39;t mean slow.) Adding onto that, I absolutely hate the icons in both ios and Mac The issue with iPadOS is that your Apps working is predicated upon Apple not kicking it off the Appstore The most impressive part it&#39;s that the new 13&quot; Pro it&#39;s almost identical to the previous model. A bit more power, weight reduction and a marginally better screen, but none of the ports, sustained power, versatility or outstanding battery life of the Macbook Pro&#39;s. It&#39;s unbelievable how much the marketing it&#39;s messing with our brains and seeing people fall for it and thinking this improvement makes it able to do way more than before.<br><br>Never buy an Apple product thinking it will help you replace 2 products or you will end up having 3 devices more than the apple vision pro💀 lol , how greedy apple is and how fool people are . <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=219\">3:39</a> nither agree nor deny😂😂 Bro&#39;s really just made a samsung s9 ultra for 3.5 times the price lol. I use my iPad to video editing so I can use my 💅 This isn&#39;t even a full review, but you&#39;ve covered this iPad so well from a variety of viewpoints that really raise questions for users, not tied to one particular review format.  The way you look at every aspect of the advantages and disadvantages compared to the iPhone and Macbook is very interesting, and it&#39;s all presented so neatly and easily understood.  Extraordinary. The ipad insta app and other apps that can scale will forever infuriate me. Scared of what&#39;s gonna happen when Zack @jerryrigeverything gets his hands on it I have m2 iPad Pro and see no reason why this one is any more worth the extra price . after some years we will be getting mac lvl performance on a apple watch!!! XD Apple keep cooking the same shit with just a minor upgrade <br>Comes with a big price tag and some of you guys keep hailing them for making this crap they call iPad just to chop our money <br>Is high time we consumers shine our eyes <br>We deserve better than this shit 😂<br>Never buying 😂😂😂😂😂 What a disgusting video from one of the most popular tech Youtuber! <br>He doesn&#39;t even understand what a computer means. These guys think if they can edit a video or a photo it&#39;s enough for a powerful machine with M4 chip.<br>Meanwhile we wanna do professional stuff, like installing jdk, python, write code when traveling and compiling sh*t. <br>I understand it&#39;s meant to be for normies but why give it a powerful chip, to do what? Phone was never meant to be a gaming machine, yet here we are.<br>How the heck is it pro, when pro can&#39;t use it? I am waiting to get Lightroom classic and I am jumping in Arun sometimes just randomly thinks a decision and while thinking he hits the record button What a rip off Thats a high praise The prices 😬😬😬😬 moral of the video tablets are useless and must be less expensive to buy , and yaa that old greedy apple less innovation more price About the storage problem of the ipad and the smart home. I as an IT Homelabing Professional recommend you to build or buy a server, there you can make a NAS (network attached storage) so you can access you data from anywhere. I mean look at Linus Tech Tips Whonnock. Its propostorous. Its 2,5 PETABYTES in space Anything, good or bad, can be justified. Still thicker than my Honor Magic V2 Bruh your a multimillionaire, your hovering over the buy button over $3600? I love your YouTube channel don&#39;t forget that you can also use your iPad Pro as a &#39;second&#39; monitor on your Macbook at any time,, I find this especially useful when editing photos on my Macbook Or buy a 4k monitor for a tenth of the price. Spending 3600 on ipad and same on vision pro and it feels like iphone 16 will also be more expensive than ever. Is it IP-rated? Display’s a W. Haven&#39;t used a tablet since the old Samsung note 8s and what not. The last one was the remarkable paper tablet and only recently just started looking for a tablet to be able to work on digital art while on the sofa. But for those prices, Apple just will not be a choice even though it has one of the better drawing software available for it. the iPad is Apple&#39;s Cayman, and the MacBook is Apple&#39;s 911. The Cayman will always be artificially limited to not overtake the 911. Could you do a video of the best affordable laptop for work that&#39;s yet good for gaming? <br>I need one that&#39;s not labeled as a gaming laptop, but has a good amount of storage for games like genshin and MC and illustrator, multiple pdfs and files<br>If there&#39;s already a video about that could anyone give me the link please? <br>Thank you I am actually surprised that no one talks about how a pro machine is thinner than the iPad Air. I mean that’s the  point of an air machine; to be thinner, lighter and easy to use and handle. I don’t get why a pro machine is thinner than the iPad Air. Remember when they pulled this same shit stunt back in 2016 with those thinner MacBook Pro that took away those ports and brought about dongle life. Yes people, that is what Apple has decided to do with the iPad Pro. They are still missing the point after all this years that no one’s wants a thinner pro iPad that will take away all the functionality of a pro machine to fit its new form factor. No one buys a pro machine for it being thin rather than getting the air iPad. They buy it for the performance, functionality and grade improvements over the air. Bro started in the morning, ended in the night for a 16.1833 minute video. 🙇 didnt know you needed a big phone for 3600 dollars where as you can get like 6x more powerful gaming pc for the same price Binod Should I go for 2024 air or 2022 pro? Does it now have a calculator? Another bendgate incoming U good man is the pencil nib (tip) for the new pro pencil the same as the old one (which is the same for pencil 1 and 2) ? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=729\">12:09</a> the guy in the background xD i dont know why im watching this after knowing im never gonna afford it I&#39;ve bought 3 iPads, and Everytime I get caught up by the hype. But after a month it sits quietly in the corner. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=826\">13:46</a> eh on ta vu brandon 😂 It&#39;s just getting silly now! The price is insane, specs totally unnecessary! It&#39;s like buying a Ferrari with only 1st gear! Clutching at straws to bring out something new that’s not needed. But people will still buy the 2tb model etc etc for Chrome, Netflix and Photo browser. I really don&#39;t like the apple eco system.<br><br>The only reason I would get an iPad is to use Procreate I will do 1 push up for every like on this comment<br>Should stop There is no value add to any tablet, yet - as long as it is not supported by the right OS and apps. So I’ve had an iPad 2, iPad Mini 6 and now iPad Air 5 and each time I try to use it as a laptop alternative, I always end up using my phone and MacBook combo cos iPadOS just never cuts it. The iPad will always be just an iPad so long as it’s restricted to iPadOS. Apple pencil 2nd generation, does not work on the new ipad. wtf. This is literally the newest Apple Pencil until yesterday and it doesn’t work. Just put McOs on the ipad and i Will buy it but for now there is no real reason to upgrade or buy the new shiny one When you have to give so much justification for a device that means you dont need it I often draw up concepts for a product. 😂 never lose touch. Never lose that. Theres only 2 main uses I see for IPads. <br>For young kids (not old enough for a smartphone) during long boring stretches outside the home to entertain them... and for professional users such as yourself or artists.<br>I cant see myself needing a tablet in my home so its just something I&#39;d use on the go.<br>If im carrying a tablet, it needs a bag of some sort so might as well just carry a laptop if I need it for the power/productivity.<br>Plenty are thin, light and battery efficient enough.<br>If I want to game on the go... well just get a steamdeck or switch.  I doubt the Ipad really has any substantial games that arent on phones, and tbh looks like a nightmare to even try to game on if it had a full library.<br>The pencil is cool, but that is quite niche. I think id rather buy a notebook and pen or just get a galaxy with one if i really needed that.<br>And for what you paid? I can get a decent 2 in 1 laptop, oled steamdeck and a new last gen galaxy fold and pen.<br>Nah. Just nah Spoiler alert: you won&#39;t have any semblance of a usable file system at all. Can&#39;t wait to bend it like iPhone 6 Plus I switched fully to iPad Pro in 2017 and sold my Mac. The most “Pro” thing I do is music production. I recently bought an M3 Pro MacBook Pro and after a few days I returned it and decided to wait for the next iPad Pro. There is something that feels very 2010 going back to Mac once you’ve used iPads as your main machine for so long. App experiences are way better than browser experiences in most cases and I just can’t go back to the Mac. Why you even bother to explain? At that price, the people who can afford it only need one reason to buy it, because they want it. <br><br>The rest are just people with poor financial decision. i can&#39;t take your reviews seriously anymore Now that you and MKBHD have gone gaga  on the hypepads, will wait for the Jerry Rig show!  That will help me decide if I should buy this as a weapon or as a clipboard. Buying a $3600 tablet is not &quot;smart&quot;. Switchin&#39; from a Mac to an iPad won&#39;t cut it unless iPadOS gets a proper overhaul for everyday folks. Day-to-day stuff like printin&#39;, scannin&#39; docs, shiftin&#39; files, and the Stage Manager feature are a bit of a joke, mate. When you wanna get somethin&#39; sorted on the spot, your brain freezes up &#39;cause it just doesn&#39;t click in those moments. The iPad&#39;s ace for entertainment, sittin&#39; just right between your iPhone and MacBook. Me: Looks nice<br>Goes back enjoying this on my redmi pad A laptop replacement? Sorry, but I&#39;ll just never get over how bad the mouse and cursor work on ipads. Bro DEEP throated his tooth brush 💀💀💀💀💀💀 I always feel much better when I&#39;m not forced to use some company&#39;s app, as that has major data privacy concerns attached to it, whereas simply using a website, thanks to ad- and scriptblocking, doesn&#39;t. When is the wedding? I still have my 3rd gen iPad Pro that I bought second hand for £500 and the last gen pencil. With an off brand keyboard and track pad case it basically does the same thing in terms of laptop-ish functionality. I still think it’s heavily nerfed by iPad OS though. Not having a conventional file system is kinda rubbish for “pro” work and you still end up duplicating files within apps own storage area. Until they change that, better off going one step further and getting a MBP, unless of course you need the pen. Still no calculator? Does it have something like DEX?  Or is it just another high powered  tablet with no place to go.... dont know about this one.... but the previous versions allways felt like a muscle car with lots of power , but is crap on the track because it has crap handling in the curves... Just finding the button to report it ! I sell ipads but am not interested in using one make sure you let us know your long term thoughts on the matte screen and if you have any build quality issues with the thin-ness the ultimate baby shark watching machine I’m genuinely afraid I’ll bend this iPad if I were to carry it in my bag. I can’t imagine anyone asked for the iPad Pro to become even thinner. They should leave that to the Air. It’s in the damn name Because you have disposable income and can’t help to brag. I miss the outro music… All the perks of a laptop ? That&#39;s quite the reach, just the basic perks which almost any tablet can do (email, keyboard, etc) One of the key things it still lacks the ability to code . It would be so cool if it could run xcode on it .. Simple.\\xa0<br><br>You bought the new iPad so you can post about it on YouTube and generate ad revenue (for those that don’t use adblockers). <br><br>I like adblockers. Ngl Xiaomi pencil is better That thick bezel though... Someone once asked me &quot;are you that dumb to be needing that many smart things in your life?&quot; and honestly there&#39;s really no good reason to be relying on smart things to live your daily life except as an excuse to not remember stuff or taking good care of yourself by needing gadgets to do it for you. I pad make sense if you are into digital art. Apple have been slowly balance the use case for iPad, iPhone and Mac for years- improve one over the other for sometimes only 6 months just to makes every category still sells. They could easily only sell Macs or only improve iPads to a point to stop selling Macs but need that balance to sell both and make the most money Arun now you are doing it wrong brother …. I hope u understand. In this vid you are almost pushing people ( forcefully) to switch to an ipad which is soo wrong. Remember one thing an ipad is an ipad no matter how powerful it is but a mac is a mac. You cannot  try to influence people to opt for a iPad instead. 😷 this is soo worng &amp; yeah btw this is your worst video ever this video deserves a dislike.  👎 as if  apple paid you to make this video. This video is soo uncomfortable to watch &amp; understanding that the amount of reach youve got &amp;  how people may subconsciously oopt  for an iPad after watching this video @mrwhoistheboss Too thin and doesn&#39;t look durable. <br>Thin isnt s thing when you put it in a case.  Where&#39;s the Mini? Don&#39;t do it, its an insane price. Couldn&#39;t they have just shifted the Apple Pencil magnets to the bottom of the tablet? Imagine someone with the whole ecosystem of the keyboard, the pencil and the iPad who wanted to upgrade.. If you want something as a replacement for a laptop it is stupid to buy an iPad because the iPadOS cannot run the apps which run on MacOS. Why dont you instead buy something like a Galaxy Book 4 360? It is a laptop with Windows and when you flip it around it becomes a tablet with the support of an S-Pen. What&#39;s that writting tablet? Can you please do a review on it I think with this price I can get a RTX 4070 with i9 13th gen PC with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD.. 😌 For it&#39;s price it&#39;s trash I really appreciate your hard work and the entertainment that you bring us with your videos. Thank you so much ❤ how reflective is the screen because normal oled tvs are like mirrors. and using oled tvs in the dark is a great way to destroy your eyes. so i wonder how apple fixed this for their ipad pro when using this in the daylight My pc costs more than that I know you are a hype man, everything tech is hype, but this ipad will break that streak. It is an amazing piece of technology. Except it is 100% useless. The software holds it back. It cannot do anything properly, all features are the worst possible solution to make sure not to step on macos territory. Unless apple updates ipados there is no point in upgrading / buying this. Have you heard about minisforum v3 windows tablet with amd 8840u inside? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=156\">2:36</a> that dual stacked OLED looks insane it looks edited 😂 Me watching and laughing on Android tablet Cracking, highly entertaining video.  Ditch the grey sack though, Arun, makes you look very bulky.  Love your stuff.  That tablet is worth more than my car.... Which eInk pad are you using please?  Link?  Wedding invite movie- Drisha climbing that wall- publish here please! You can have cellular on iPad without having a plug in modem. Wow, the price increase is almost 50% since iPad pro M1. Long time ipad user here, also I am a developer. I love my ipad. I use it everyday but 70% of the time to take notes by writing, 25% of the time to watch something, 3% as a second screen to my mac when I am traveling and 2% random apps, chrome etc...  Other than that, it is nowhere near to replace a laptop. This is by design. I hate Apple for this. They are not allowing us to utilize the hardware. You can&#39;t even code on it properly. My sister who is aillustrator love it of course. She utilizes the hardware way more than me. But my point is it&#39;s not even close to replace a laptop. I only recommend it if you can afford it or expense it.. You can buy an &#39;A&#39; grade  M2 11&quot; ipad pro 2TB cellular from cex for £1150. I was originally thinking of getting the new air 11&quot; 1TB cellular but that would be £1249. So £99 more for half the storage and no 120hz. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=493\">8:13</a> this line felt like an Apple presentation 😅 “ 5 x “ emphasized , it’s okay you don’t have to feel guilty for wanting the new fancy tech , you’ve earned it bro ☺️ I hate Samsung so much Using your views to pay for ridiculous priced iPad 2.8k nice trick.  BTW I have an M1 iPad pro and see no reason to change Ugh. You completely brushed over how absolutely obscenely overpriced and limited this is and just hyped it start to finish is just 106% fanboy. Probably the most unbalanced review I’ve seen in ages. Jerry is getting ready to zig-zag that screen and back. Carter , give mommy back her iPad.. This seems to be  a huge upgrade for the ipads and the the company itself Well... If you can find what to do with it.. Then awesome.. But in my opinion? If you think the iPad would replace your Mac... Considering the limitation of apps for iPad OS... Then I don&#39;t see any reason you can&#39;t use Samsung&#39;s best tablet.. It&#39;s also as thin, and powerful for tablet use cases.. Plus, you get more games all while being cheaper.. <br><br>Honestly man, I know you don&#39;t mind the expense, but if you really feel you can replace your work setup with the iPad.. You would be completely fine with Samsung. <br><br>I honestly don&#39;t like the fact that we encourage these companies to price their products ridiculously. <br>Why not sell the whole gadget together. <br><br>Why would a pro user buy the iPad without the pencil and folio if they (Apple) claim they want it to replace the Mac.. <br><br>It&#39;s just like selling the Mac without the trackpad and keyboard.. Just ridiculous.. We, by we, those who just rush and buy apple products without thinking it through properly are the reason they keep charging ungodly fees (just as MKBHD put it) for their really not so innovative tech.. It sucks.. Because you want to review it 😂 I used to have an ipad mini 4, but after i bought the iphone 14 pro max i havent used it. All that money just to watch Netflix on .... With portable devices you sacrifice quite a bit for the portability often the price and the power ....apple found the secret which is to charge a lot of money for everything lol For me, it&#39;s definitely very tempting for all the same reasons. Can&#39;t wait for the nano-ultra-screen to find its way to Macbooks You can&#39;t run adblock on iPad OS; mouse support is pathetic. You&#39;re better off on a MacBook Air You probably never heard of Adguard. It works on Macs as well as on the iPhone/iPad/Android Let&#39;s not go down this route again. The iPad might seem like it would be good as a laptop replacement but the reality is that you will encounter situations where you can&#39;t do what you want to do and would have been able to do it on a Mac. I&#39;m typing this on my 14&quot; M1 Pro MacBook Pro and still loving it. Zero desire to upgrade. Maybe the M5 Pro but even then, my M1 Pro doesn&#39;t hold me back so I&#39;ll probably just save my money. when I started watching this video I got an advert for the new ipad Bro im watching somebody who doesnt like tablets by a 3600 dollar tablet while im watching on a old ipad air 😭 I use my ipad pros as my main computer when I&#39;m out and about. M1 is plenty fast for any music editing, recording, composing. Definitely more useful than a laptop for my use case. Do you connect an Audio Interface to your iPad? @@RabianskiT I&#39;m a pianist so my &#39;recording&#39; work is done via midi controller keyboard so no. Got an interface at home plugged into my pc for any vocals etc. it isn’t a replacement it can’t do nearly as much as a computer Worst Apple ad ever No rick roll this video?, shocking How much did you charged apple for justifying such a ridiculous price ?😂😂 You say samsung tablet still use mobile chips 😂😂, while also admitting that ipads are powerful but can do much less work than macs, due to software Extremely powerful social media machines😂 I have an m1 iPad Air and I use it all day at home. I’d say it was worth it for me considering how much I use it but there’s zero reason to upgrade it. How powerful of a chip do I need for the limited ipad OS. I think stage manager is the best iPad OS feature since it makes the iPad more laptop like with the multiple windows but I’ll be damned if apple think I’m ever upgrading to a more powerful social media machine for £2000. I get they don’t want to take away from MacBook sales but that really shows how money hungry they are. Ipad is overrated <br>Don’t know why but every tech youtuber promotes ipad guys, if u are broke, its ur problem STOP with the THIN. give us battery and features Forget about the power and price, some of apps like Instagram doesn’t have an Ipad optimised app they have iphone’s layout. It feels such a waste of screen area when you open it I can&#39;t wait so I can check emails, and watch youtube on it! bro literally made a video from day to night bend test finna be wild with this one 🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 This video will not age well. Also, are you using Remarkable because it does something the iPad cant or because its a eink display Imagine getting this and the apple vision pro for almost the price of an old car  💀 As a programmer, I must say, tablets are decades away from having a use case for me. I&#39;m a laptop (+ external displays) / smartphone kind of guy. I doubt this comment gets like😅 Can it survive the bend test?

M4 + being super slim, having no active cooling hmmmmm here comes extreme throttling Please get a prenuptial agreement Mac isn’t bad for gaming, its just the lack of games. Minecraft is a good option but you can also play fortnite, cs:go and other games you could download<br>of chrome Since the iPad 2, the tablet is my most used computer. Phones are a pain for to do anything other than communication, the tablet experience is in a different world. Meh...I remain unimpressed. Great some will like it, but this is absurd amount of money for the extra, extra device. Knowing Apple: I will be shocked if you will be allowed to drop MacBook for this one. That ain&#39;t how they operate. I expect enough shortcomings on each device, for people to keep both. Yeah, this product is certainly not for me... Honestly extremely niece and... Quite frankly I don&#39;t know if it does anything better that already professional, similarly priced drawing tablets do + With left over for something like... Oneplus Tablet lmao. Why is the size of the bezels equal to the square surface of Great Britain Bro called us Poor in 8 Terabytes ways 😶\\u200d🌫️😐 My brother, my sister, I know, life is hard. You are probably going through a very difficult time, and you have the impression that it is getting worse and worse, you don&#39;t know who to confide in, because the world is turning its back, your family can&#39;t understand you, or maybe -maybe you&#39;re simply afraid that he won&#39;t understand you. You are no longer sure of having real friends, you no longer sleep at night, you are tired, mentally, physically, spiritually. This world calls you weak, and you start to believe it, you are desperate. Know this, God is with you, he sees your pain, your suffering, your loneliness, and he wants to help you and is just waiting for that. But for that, you have to open the door for him. God loves you with a love so pure that he sent his only son Jesus Christ to save you from death. So return to him and your heart will be at peace. BE BLESSED 💖💖🙏🙏 Hey arun try the Samsung s9 tab ultra and compare with apple&#39;s tablet ZENLESS ZONE ZERO You can&#39;t develop software on an iPad, that way it will never be a laptop replacement for developers. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=44\">0:44</a>  ayo 😮 Finally Arun Talk about Ipad for the first Time 🖤 The problem with the iPad with a keyboard was that it was thicker than the MacBook Air so what they did here seems great. But I do fear for battery life… Maaaaan ,I don&#39;t think we give you enough credit for that, but you really make tech interesting and your videos are  just sooooo enjoyable. I am just waiting for &quot;tech purchases I retreat&quot; video... Pretty sure there will be an Ipad I dont need to watch this video, as soon as in the apple presentation the guy says &quot;there is no such a device in the world&quot; when speaking of a fucking tablet, I know its just a marketing brain wash thats all. Some cheap chinese tablet which is 10x cheaper will do exactly what this over priced piece of shit will As an apple fanboy I’m spending the more or less on a gaming pc. Apple needs to get a grip! Quality of their products is declining and prices climbing. that toothbrush clip was diabolical You have 18 million subs, you can afford an M4 iPad. Ipad Air 13inch is 😍😍😍 Another clickbait thumbnail, hum? You don’t have the device, man… think mkbhd&#39;s impressions were a lot more grounded than yours You&#39;re deep into LSD of Apple product or you value ur money less... you&#39;re reaching a bit too hard to justify your purchase, and the things you&#39;re listing you&#39;ll definitely end up doing on your phone most of the time i think Pin me bro I reckon he will go back to his macbook during a week Iphone 15 pro was kinda the same choice for me in terms of AI, I like to know what my device will be able to do before buying it, the fact you still don&#39;t know the battery capacity is wild, especially with a super thin device, Apple defo hiding the battery life from people and thinking they can fix it with an update... This isn&#39;t the 15 pro so lets hope they can pull it off again, I did visibly notice the Ipad they had on display in Westfields battery was draining whilst plugged in running the video editing app (forgot the name of it) but that&#39;s kinda concerning... hopefully it was just a dodgey charger. Arun is tempting more than the apple event I am watching this video and I only thought the product already exists, that lenovo laptop which has 2 chips and 2 os. Which is windows and android, whichever you want to use??? We all love watching products we can’t afford That thing is gonna bend so easy, don&#39;t do it man, get an iPad Mini and keep your laptop, it will cover the needs you metion in the video US $3600 for a tablet? Wow, the price you pay to surf the net while lying on your bed. $3600 that&#39;s a lot of cash for reading newpaper in bed. i’m so pissed that if i wanna buy the ipad pro, i need to get the new keyboard. my previous magic keyboard not being compatible is infuriating This is Cocomelon machine😂 If too expensive then get a galaxy tablet it has the spen in the box at no extra charge but no charger which is cheaper than buying Apple Pencil pro it has an amoled screen same as s24ultra. It does all the same things as ipad except m4 chip in ipad is overkill Watching it on M1 iPad Air 5 🫠 Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! a dark room saying that he&#39;ll prove a product mmm <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=618\">10:18</a> why does iPadOS not use the desktop class web browser that Macs have? Let’s start there. Fix that, and then we can talk about upgrading. does this mean the last gen gonna be cheaper? Bro are we not getting any review on the new Huawei P70, been waiting for you 😒 to review it.. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=735\">12:15</a> hahaha notre BrandonLeProktor national Price is insane. Samsung S9 ultra and you could still buy a cheap car with the change. Love how nobody can use their old magic keyboards again! Can’t wait to hear your thoughts on this amazing piece of technology once you had it for a couple of weeks! It&#39;s a great device, but not much different (in functionality) with previous years.  It needs a better OS really, to take advantage of the powerful chip (as MKBHD suggested). Thinner = shorter lifespan <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=360\">6:00</a> can&#39;t wait for him to download instagram on ipad and completely flip out then realize there&#39;s no default calculator app 😅 Dude ipad doesn&#39;t come with the YouTube app on default but that doesn&#39;t mean that iPads don&#39;t have youtube😂<br><br>You can easily download calculators from appstore<br><br>And yes the Instagram sucks on an ipad😂 Not usefull as software hinders the power this chip has the $3000 tablet is real You can&#39;t get visual studio, vs code, or any Jet Brains&#39; IDEs in an IPad. The fact that he started recording in Morning and Ended at night...That&#39;s called Dedication to Perfection!! 3600$ well jump in guys, it&#39;s limited offer 🫴 😂 , wtf , where did the 999$ tablet gone? , i think apple thinks that all of us have 5k salary or something to come with this price range witch definitely it&#39;s not worth it and will never be DAY 1 OF ASKING ARUN TO GET THE OLD OUTRO BACK They made a surface pro but for 10x the price Funny timing of this ipad release,,, since arun just made a video about the costs of having apple products repaired....<br><br>Those thin ipad pros are definitely going to be expensive to have repaired. well... Using word and microsoft paint isnt something that&#39;s new to tablets. imagine spending nearly 3k on something that can be stolen or broken in seconds, just because its light. But I guess its pretty smart to review whilst purchasing it, &quot;let me make a video of me buying the Ipad and that will pay for it&quot; My 2 year old son will love watching Bluey on this.... Nice tablet. Just a shame it is made by Apple. Very interesting video. Since stage manager I use my iPad Pro M1 more than my Mac for the reasons you stated. Side note you can just link your android phone directly to your iPad Pro and import photos. I took my pixel 4XL on holiday for using as a spare camera (unlimited uploads free) and then just linked it to my iPad Pro and copied all the photos across in the photo application. No AirDrop, no problem. I also swap to S24 Ultra and I use the app Blip to substitute AirDrop, is brilliant. Bro, doing everything to convince himself to buy an apple ipad.<br><br>Mac has bigger battery<br>Mac has a steady hinge, you can work while commuting.<br>Mac is faster.<br>Mac only needs your mobile wifi. Ipad cellular is too expensive.<br>Mac has mac software support.<br>Mac is cheaper than ipad.<br><br>Please don&#39;t make your self fool. You have the money, just buy it. Nice haircut vro The background music is loud and annoying. Love the video though I always said and will say this again: &quot;Laptops are gonna be obsolete one day replaced by tablets, whether you like it/believe it or not&quot;. Feels like this video has been made by someone after every single iPad release. When it won’t even replace the Remarkable in the end. Apple needs to do something similar to Samsung dex for the ipad. So allow Mac os to run on it. They&#39;d sell like hot cakes with a more desktop experience. I’ve ordered one. I’ve had the 2021 iPad Pro for a while now and the blooming has been a constantly noticeable thing. More than anything I’m really excited for the switch to OLED I love tablets. But this is overkill. Great computer so how to run localhost server, browser inspect element, terminal, xcode, android studio or vs code? Oh wait... Definitely concerned about a future that is primarily on apps. You lose a  lot of functionality in terms of being able to compare prices and have power over your own web experience. You become locked into their ecosystem and their ads. I feel like continuing  in this direction only makes that problem worse :/ <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=75\">1:15</a> tablets r mainlt focused on digital artists, buissness nigaa , architecture njg, editors a lot I wouldn&#39;t buy a tablet from Apple because they have too many shortcomings.  It would be better if you bought a tablet from Samsung I bought the M1 iPad Pro when it came out thinking it could replace most of what I do with my laptop. Turns out iPad OS just really sucks. It constantly reminds you that it’s not a real OS. A really simple example - compare the print menu on iPad to a Mac. Might not sound like a huge deal… until you need to print something and you can’t rotate, enlarge, print two-sided, etc. Tons of small things like that you don’t even think about on a Mac but are really inconvenient or impossible on an iPad. So now my expensive-as-a-laptop iPad is basically just being used by my son to play Roblox. The Japanese has a word for this &quot;ii-nah&quot; - literal translation to - it must be nice. That must be nice. Why didn’t you feel that way about the M1 or the M2 iPad? Because….. 🗣️ IT’S THE SAME THING Thank God I&#39;m not an isheep <b>iPhone 6 flashback</b> Sounds like you’re just happy being away from home, meeting some colleagues and some apple guy has sold you the story of why you need an iPad. <br>Dude, stop acting “sheeply” and spend more time with the misses instead of hyping an unwanted product. It&#39;s the opposite for me. When a company tells me to use their app, I&#39;m repelled. Most shop apps are phone-screen-framed websites anyway, just give me the website app on the website. I&#39;m not going to hoard 100 apps for 100 shops. day night different Did you see the sunset how long did it take him to take the video That&#39;s a lot of money for a tablet. It would be cool if they could integrate MacOS into the iPad Pro like a surface book. He needs to stop talking about his wedding to Yoko Ono. No one carers if he’s gay. Really dislike how there&#39;s 4 different pencils now and they only work with specific ipads. <br><br>Mad You know why benchmark apps are faster on iOS? Because they are optimized for that specific platform. Android phones are so varied in CPU and RAM configuration that it&#39;s not possible to optimise for it in a general way. So when you see single core performance being higher on an apple device, it&#39;s because the software used to make that benchmark is optimised with that architecture in mind. Does it have lidar I NEED TO KNOW 👹👹👹👹👺👺👺🤡👺👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹 does it have a calculator tho? No one optimizes apps for ipad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=364\">6:04</a> wow tilt sensor, absolutely never seen before years ago on devices that cost 1/3 the price yo i was in the apple event live i left each 10 seconds LOL I think we will see a video in a couple of month &quot;Why I switched from my iPad to my mac&quot;, but seriously why get an iPad even if it have every app you need? the Mac will still run those apps better + the mac is cheaper, and the iPad isn&#39;t that smaller, it&#39;s 13 inch, the way I see it is that it&#39;s an overpriced touch screen MacBook air . I would still say the Tab S9+ and the Tab S9 Ultra with Samsung Dex capability is just way superior compared to the iPad with a very average user experience with iPad OS. The Galaxy tabs are also equally thinner and the Tab S9 ultra is an absolute beauty. The only &quot;tablet&quot; that makes sense is something that works as a full laptop but then you use the screen to more comfortably watch stuff or handwrite. Surface Pro style. The biggest issue of the iPad is iPad OS. It needs MacOS. iPadOS is crap. Wtf higher than vision pro ? Is it ? Oyyu Congrats and best wishes on the upcoming nuptials<br>Love your work for years<br>Thanks for all the hard work ipad kid. I strongly disagree on the app versus web thing 9/10 apps are just the website but outside a browser. So you have the &quot;benefit&quot; of not seeing the url bar. Hence webapp I really hope this isn&#39;t as bad as the iPhone 6... I hope Apple watched JerryRigEverything to fix every single one of their problems. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=477\">7:57</a> The second camera just pops out of no where, what is it? What if Apple just announced a MacBook with touchscreen and compatible with Pencil Pro...<br>Bye bye iPad 👋 at that price id rather get an apple vision pro People talking about how ipad could completely replace a laptop for years now, it have a &quot;laptop chip&quot; since 2021 with the M1, the issue is not how strong or capable the iPad itself is, but rather Apple that intensionally limits it in the software, and this won&#39;t change this year I already ordered it at the keynote...then cancelled it. I reconsidered the following: I will buy it if the iPad finally is &quot;getting loose&quot; as Apple promised. If I can fully replace my MacBook, I will buy the most expensive iPad and sell my MacBook Pro....but maybe Apple doesn&#39;t want me to do that. So it all depends on next month&#39;s WWDC... iPad 10 gen is the best due to its prices and performance, rather than these iPads they cost almost as much as a flipping pc 😅 Stick with the MacBook Pro, use the iPad by using something like Jump Desktop to connect remotely to the MacBook Pro where required. That solution works for me. For the love of God stop saying &quot;Apple made the best screen&quot; when it&#39;s a Samsung and LG panel. Apple does not make displays. These are Samsung&#39;s panels. People somehow still don&#39;t realize a lot of Apple components are made by Samsung, like their memory, their screens and several other components. Wow kinda early TIM COOK: Let&#39;s see you fix this new iPad of ours<br>LOUIE ROSSMAN: Repairing a malfunctioned Mac is one thing but a broken iPad is another issue. this new iPad gets me asking why apple insists on keeping a notch their laptops.

It&#39;s not about the fan, which either MacBook Air has it. More about the software side, these &quot;pro apps&quot; they keep calling is the &quot;kiddie&quot; version of the actual pro apps they have on Windows/Mac It’s because it can do a lot but it’s still technically more inefficient and time consuming to do things on it since it’s limited by the iPad OS. People really want to be able to replace their computer with it because it’s everything in one but the software just makes it not an amazing experience The mac doesn&#39;t have a cooling fan WDYM? macbook air m1, m2 and m3 has no cooling fan After few months he and everyone else will make a video why the new apple iPad pro was not what they expected or titles like 3600$ waste bec not upto mark<br>It&#39;s the same cycle for all of them Macs dont have a cooling fan lol.. Apple Sillicon chips are based on mobile chips therefore they dont need extra cooling. That&#39;s the reason why you dont hear any kind of noise in a mac. I assure you my ipad pro m1 does not heat up nor does it lag on the apps it handles, even 100mb autodesk files where my s21 ultra chokes. Its not really about the ipad not having enough cooling but the ipados itself is the problem. The file system, the restrictiveness of ipados compared to the mac and the software support is laughable considering you have an M4 inside, even the M1 is still an overkill. \\u200b@@bintangg6506the airs dont have cooling fans, the pros do @@namrehtv2746they have better passive cooling though @@bintangg6506 MBPs have fans 70% of people could probably easily replace their laptops with tablets because most people are not really using high demanding software that has a lot of workload.

M4-❤ Mike drop! one question.. do we now have a calculator on the iPad?? Thank you for the video :) Always spot on. And staying up till 6:40am? That&#39;s commitment &lt;3 same as every other apple product,its worth about 200 quid and the rest is for the &quot;expereince&quot; of owning an apple product! over priced tat! The smart toothbrush shot was W I L D mkbhd says its Just an IPAD and my man here says this IPAD can replace the laptop! I am confused!! Quite different reviews!<br><br>Lets see what Dave2D says :D Bro trying to justify the price little to hard 😂 waiting for iPad 11 M4 chip but cannot have a calculator The most MKBHDy video of Mrwhosethoseboss... Unfortunately lacks the excitement, the jump and attention to detail in review (which was there in MKBHD&#39;s version as he analyzed Apple&#39;s presentation better to talk more about battery and other stuff)<br><br>I hope this feedback makes the coming videos better!! Curious to see what JerryRigEverything has to say about the new thinner iPads. Calculator laughing from the corner 🙃 One out of millions who will just rather watch this review than having to purchase it 😊 Pirating on pc&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s 2 am for me gotta watch What&#39;s the issue? Ipad Pro is for professionals…they reduced the iPad for the masses…don&#39;t spoil the joy for advanced users! iPad pro 13” 1tb all the way baby..upgrade is happening! The ipad is the ONE apple product that I would like to own.<br><br>Obviously I&#39;m not gonna spend over 3k on a tablet but I would <i>love</i> to have it lol. Especially good for artists I have an M1 iPad and I would never buy another one. As much powerful and sleek this device is, the OS is just so bad for tiniest of task. Very limited and restricted. Unless you are a creator or student, DO NOT BUY. I am regretting my decision why I didn’t buy an Android tablet. Useless Love ur vids ❤ I’ve predicted in the past that iPads will end up having a containerised MacOS instance that you can use alongside iPadOS, surely the technology is here now? The pro would actually be fitting of its name then.<br><br>I also hope that will be the future for smartphones, where Android phones can plug in and have a full speed Windows OS available For artists what photo editing app is that? The multicam final cut for ipad plus final cam (up to 4 iPhones at once) is a great addition. If it can run Football Manager full game is all that matters. Only 13k likes in 1 hour. Bro fell off Most powerful  machine for playing  ludo and watching  youtube netflix and anime I haven&#39;t used a tablet in almost a decade and the fact that thing is so thin concerns me. I&#39;m not a gently person with my electronics, so I&#39;ll need a cover that rend the whole &quot;thin and light&quot; irrelevant. Plus, I do love a big screen. Is there a 15 or 17 in version? Although the thinness sounds really good for weight reduction I feel like it would make the iPad too fragile I would worry about putting it in a backpack especially after watching Jerryrigeverything videos on iPad durability iPad mini 6 is the best general purpose iPad. Only $529 for the 256GB WiFi version. Hey. Can you provide a link to the writing pad? Can&#39;t wait for @JerryRigEverything to bend that thing! Codm finna go crazy It&#39;s funny how Apple controls the tech space😅 Me sitting here watching this on my iPad 5 mini 😂 I think this video is just a long justification for you not to feel bad that you have bought that ridiculous expensive ipad. @Mrwhosetheboss can you compare this with the Samsung S9? Websites are much better than apps. Websites will work on every device. If you want good apps on every device you have to pay for a lot of development.<br><br>Websites &gt; apps I’m still on an m1 iPad Pro, prior to which was a 5th gen pro, always 12.9, I see no reason to upgrade for what I use it for, I do have it 5G enabled, with a basic sim deal from EE I pay about  £10 and family share my data from my mobile phone contract.  You raised a good point about the battery life, we’ll wait and see. Nah i ll rather get a pc bruhh Its almost time to build the world&#39;s largest iPhone all the perks of ipad you mentioned are for youtubers maybe. new ipad is useful to you to make youtube videos. There isn&#39;t any feature for the general public who watches your videos. <br><br>Whole video is about what &quot;you&quot; can do with the new ipad. It&#39;s crazy how these YouTuber are able to accept apple simple mistakes but would complain the entire video if Samsung had had those mistakes Hallelujah!!! I&#39;m the favorite, $60,000 every week! Now I can afford anything and also support the work of God and the church. For me, it was always iPad .. right from the start.. I bought the OG iPad because watching movies on something so cool and portable was amazing .. compared to our bulky laptops back then. From there, it gradually increased to tasks like online shopping, reading, e-books, bit of gaming .. and now, I edit all my YouTube videos , thumbnails and short-form videos on it! For me, the most important gadget in my home, besides my iPhone is my iPad! So much so that if it breaks, I will run to the store and get one right away! Still feel a samsung tab would be better Apple devices are seriously well made and I can completely understand why people buy into them, but holy crap do they price their stuff ridiculously high. £3,500 is an obscene amount for something that will likely be made redundant quickly. Don&#39;t get too existed Arun! I got all of them: MacbooPro, iPad Pro, iPhone Pro Max, Apple Watch, Airpod Pro: However, the most useless device is the iPad Pro because It&#39;s not a phone and it&#39;s not a MacBook Pro.<br>---&gt; Many of the MacOS Apps are not compatible to iPadOS, and it&#39;s making it useless until that changes.<br><br>Edit:<br>For example: <br>- Virtual Machines (Parallel desktop) isn&#39;t working where I can use Windows. (I want on the machine, not a remote one)<br>- Office 365 on Mobile is still very limited, especially Excel, for a professional<br>- Adobe Photoshop is still not the full version on it.<br>- Many of my programming software are still not compatible with iPadOS. So, the fact that it is still a Mobile OS is instead a disadvantage than an advantage. And looking at the price, I&#39;d rather use a Macbook Pro with an old iPad than a new iPad without a Macbook pro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=575\">9:35</a> Bruh, not all of us are youtubers, editors and artists. We are still in the PC first world, nothing will beat actual PCs rn, well not in the form of a tablet anyway. Yea yea, there may be some people who will replace their laptop or PC with a tablet, but that will be a very small amount of people. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have an iPad too (the 12.9 m1 pro one), which I use as a media device, for example to watch movies in airplanes or when I&#39;m too lazy to get to my laptop, but it will never replace my laptop, which is my primary work (non apple software engineering) and gaming device. So expensive for à machine Apple launches new product, tech suckers buy it.<br><br>3 months later you won&#39;t be using it still, it&#39;s an IPAD it has no use case except for flexing it in public and slowly realising nobody cares if you&#39;ve got an iPad or a MacBook. its easy to compare it to a laptop when you talk about performance but can we all just keep in mind that this thing has only 1 port? Having an M1 iPad Pro 11&#39;  and a M2 MacBook Air 15&#39; myself, the ONLY difference I feel in performance is in the OS. All I want is a better way for file management and the freedom to download anything/everything (like you already can through any browser on Mac) and I would never buy a Mac or any other PC ever again. Every other service I personally needed a machine or gaming console for is already on some sort of cloud streaming service already.  I believe they&#39;re waiting for Mac sales to be utterly garbage (worse than to already is at least) before pulling the trigger to unleash iPad&#39;s full potential Will never consider getting Apple products (Android user and want to switch to any Android device), but still watch because I like tech and Mrwhostheboss. So I got the Note 20 phone, watch 6 and the Tab s9 and I am so happy with how they work together (especially the earbuds switching between the active device and that the tab and phone comes with a pen, plus multi tasking). Same. I have to admit that those new iPad Pros are rocking really cool hardware, but at their current (absurd) price they&#39;re simply out of the question. Not to mention that iPadOS is so locked down in terms of functionality that it would be like driving a Ferrari to go to work. I love my Tab S9 and can&#39;t find a single reason to upgrade anytime soon @@kiwisorbet Exactly, some nice features, but not something to compromise for (like the dynamic island thing I liked, but it is still an iphone and the Samaung has the light up edge with notification pop up). Wait until while Jerry will bend it like a paper 😂😂😂 I am so used to being marketed to that I expected a discount code to his wedding at the end of the video. Even though a wedding isn&#39;t a paid event. Arent you married already ? no matter what, I still don&#39;t get the idea of using iPads with keyboards, if you&#39;re intended to use it like a laptop, then buy a mac? I bought iPad 3-4 years ago because of pencil. and this is how they can still going with ipads . If there wasn&#39;t apple pen ,there is nothing rest unique on ipad. Some NBA players use a ipad as a phone bc it has cellular and their hands are so big😂 then theres us talking about it like a laptop. It is only 3 am, bro is time traveling 🤯 Does it have 120Hz? Looks really smooth Literally useless without macOS Does it come with a calculator? that&#39;s my biggest question As a Google user from the beginning , I had to admit Ipad Pro was the best choice for my hobbies. Bought my first 2020 changed to m1 and now definitely going to buy this new. Using external storage is easy nowadays also MS OneDrive integration is working fine no need iCloud. I forgot where my Windows laptop is.. Using the tablet for reading and watching + gaming is much easier and better. Also heaving logic keyboard and mouse which connects to the tablet using my HP docking station for having an external screen and more ports feels like a proper laptop. would get one, but you can&#39;t really code on the ipad as you cant access the terminal to my knowledge :/. I don&#39;t think an iPad is better to be used as a Mac. The use of the power on the iPad isn&#39;t gonna be maximized like it would on the Mac. Not to mention features and compatibility. For the things you use an ipad for you would be fine on an older ipad M1 or lower. You do nothing on there that requires any power tbh I doubt you&#39;re using iMovie to make your youtube videos Idk, man. I gave up laptop life in 2016 for a purely mobile experience between my iPhone and iPad. Here I am today with an iPhone 14 Pro Max and a 12.9&quot; M1 iPad Pro... and I wish I had bought a laptop instead. I&#39;ve tried using this thing a ton of different ways but more often than not, I&#39;m just way more able to accomplish tasks efficiently on a Windows computer than I am an iPad... and I&#39;ve been using Apple products for most of my life.<br><br>Until they put iOS on an iPad, it&#39;ll just be a super expensive entertainment device. iOS is on the iPad I hate how everything is going to apps. Everything is becoming a download, requiring an account, being locked down and largely unmodifiable. Websites can be good, but everyone poured money into the apps instead of making sure their site worked better. Also generally sick of iPad being ALMOST great. But until they just allow me to use both iOS and MacOS on hardware that absolutely can let me do that, or until they include the full suite of phone benefits like the full range of cameras and sensors, it&#39;s useless to me. I don&#39;t want to buy three interconnected devices, I just want the one, and until that happens I don&#39;t feel the need to overspend on overhyped, locked down hardware stuck in its own little bubble away from my entire current PC and Android based ecosystem. Samsung S9 ultra is still better and cheaper until i use an ipad like my macbook pro, this is over specced. i have thousands of songs in itunes. and use it to sync with phone and ipads. can&#39;t do that with an ipad as the core database Until developer tools become available, I will give it a wide berth! Just unlock the device to allow a power user to use the full features of iOS! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=525\">8:45</a> wtf? S24 ultra in apple store Thats an s23 ultra Then what? Should everyone have iPhone in order to emter the apple store?😂🤦🏻\\u200d♂️ Apple could definitely make iPadOS much better than it is but they&#39;re probably holding back on purpose so people still buy macs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=341\">5:41</a> xD Can get a high end pc with that price playing games in 4k with ipad os cant do Pointless upgrades….a M1 chip iPad more than enough at the moment, I would like to see 90hz screens on lower models, faster charging, oled screens on all models. Your in a temu ad me watching this on my 9th gen ipad which I just bought previous month &#39;You just bought it!&#39;......because you have money to buy it. If you are out of money then a million reasons can&#39;t buy you one......😁 i just dont like how i cant use apple pencil 2, this is ridiculous jesus 3600 usd. Imagine thats your 1 year food budget. Well good luck on your bankruptcy apple. You can only use the brand new cases with these and they only cost £350! This stuff is why I hate Apple and try to never use their products. any reason for apple to be greedy All that power and still can’t choose what resolution your media should be. I&#39;m expecting an &quot;Underwhelmed&quot; or &quot;Disappointed&quot; update video after having used it for a while, and then switching back to your MacBook. I was an &quot;iPad as your computer&quot; guy all throughout my time in college. iPadOS just holds these devices back from their true potential. Which is probably on purpose, otherwise the iPad would cannibalize some MacBook sales. No rabbit r1 review its strange lol. iPad trap. You buy and find out you can’t do half of the things like on laptop. Millions went through it. Now your turn I guess I feel like crying out of jealousy because I have the iPad Pro 3rd gen and I rlly want this one for my school Between this and the s9 ultra, which is the thinnest? Is it worth upgrading to this new iPad from the iPad Pro M2? Probably not Unbox Therapie = &quot;heavy breathing&quot; Straight up violating that toothbrush. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Lmaoo My non-existent gf fr Facts, I was hoping someone else noticed Honestly until they put a more capable OS on it I’ll stick with my M1 Pro for Procreate I&#39;m quite excited to see how the new iPad handles like while being powered by the all new M4 chip while also being ridiculously thin. Also can&#39;t wait to see what type of AI stuff Apple has been cooking in the background. im waiting for apple cloth pro So Arun just said that the studio we grew in with is about to be switched :/ Can do more on android tabs. I&#39;ve had the M1 12 inch Pro iPad since new at launch, and a 2018 version before then.  The batteries barely last through 4 or 5 hours.  Even less with heavy pencil use.  Be interesting to see what the battery life is for this.  Arun, be wary of battery life.  But, I&#39;ve been able to use most battery banks to recharge. does Samsung have this typa tablet? Many ipad are used for professional use. But many are comparing it with features of an phone. ipad are regularly used for  animation, editing software and many other features that are similar to an laptop but it is more flexible and much easier to use unlike bulky laptops This video is kinda subjective.<br><br>You are reviewing this iPad as someone who has not used an iPad for years.<br><br>The magik keyboard, I bought it for the 12.9 inch pro, and i despise it. It has no hot bar and the quality sucks In what time did you please live, where tablets were ever better than the corresponding smartphone from the corresponding manufacturer? goodjob pushing 13inch ipads.. How does a sales guy sounds like … I mean a really really really good sales guy !!!? <br>Watch this Zack is gonna have a field day with this The English accent change is pretty mani-festing ❤😅 Is this vedio secretly sponsored by apple 😂 Nah, apple never sponsored anyone to my knowledge Me: Wow i can do all my tasks more efficiently-<br>My bank account:Are you sure about that but can it run freeform I kind of see your point...but I think its a fairly niche segment of people that say &quot;yes, I have a MacBook and am willing to toss that away and spend triple the money on an iPad replacement&quot;. Plus they have to buy all their apps again if didn&#39;t already have them on iPad. The future is not laptops I agree, but it&#39;s not iPad OS either.<br><br>I think Apple are going to struggle with this one. I just have this feeling it&#39;s a bad release that I don&#39;t think is going to sell as well as they&#39;re hoping (not that they would say it is below expectations :) ) Bro actually forgot what money is after becoming rich (no offence)🤣🤣 btw love your videos. iPad recall coming soon Bro about to make a £3k Mistake if he wants to use his iPad as a true MacBook replacement💀 I‘ve used my iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard for 2 Years now for my Uni Studies, the limitations of iPadOS become VERY clear VERY fast (especially with MS Office which is like 95% of my workflow) Please make a full video review when u get it , <br>It&#39;s been a while u did an interesting video 👍 Why the video is so dark? you blocked your pun with a card at the end of the video 🥲 You should do a tablet review of the latest Samsung with the latest iPad... it would be so good alot of money to distract kids I&#39;m just over here watching the progression from day to night. Lol 😂 How many of these 500+€ (the base one onwards) will break within the first year? 🤔😂 <br>It&#39;s so thin! I would never be able to carry it around with me without a cover 😅<br><br>But except this it&#39;s super impressive and I&#39;m intrigued to see how the Android universe will respond if they will... Because as of rn the only 2 really good tablets are from Apple or Samsung 😅 and it&#39;s almost a monopoly from the first one! With prices that are extremely too high It used to cost around 1.200 dollars for 2020 ipad pro with pencil and keyboard…<br>Now it costs around 3000 dollars for …this all… 😅 yeaaa… While it might be getting close to Macbooks in performance, the price is getting up there too if you include memory and the keyboard thingy. At the same time it doesn&#39;t actually have feature parity and while we do actually pay more for MBPs at work because the price is in our eyes worth it, I would hesitate to splurge what is pretty much a pretty good gaming PC on what at the end of the day is still a tablet. Cant wait until jerryrig everything get their hands on this The new wallpaper actually spells “pro” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=611\">10:11</a> Nice catch! Bro edits faster than me dad left me That ipad no shit cost more than my house dear all or some your complain, we have already in Samsung Tab S9 😅 Was that a Motorola Xoom???? Great video but if you swap your  laptop for an iPad I recommend you keep the remarkable tablet as the e ink screen is less harmful for eyes and sleep So like a Surface Pro then? Trouble is when you want to jot down notes/sketches while reading or working. You need two devices then, and then you are back to laptop+tablet. Apple doesn&#39;t want you to buy just an ipad<br>They want you to buy apple Note to self: All you do is watch YouTube, Rumble, or read a newspaper. DO NOT BUY!!! May of my classmates in university used an iPad with a keyboard+cover instead of a MacBook. The iPad did everything the MacBook did and paired with their iPhone seamlessly.<br>One problem I saw with their iPads was they weren&#39;t as durable as the MacBook. Many of their iPads screens were broken when they dropped them or had them in their school backpacks and got them crushed from books or pointy hard objects inside that cracked their screens uner pressure on the device inside.<br>Looking forward to seeing how you use it and share it with your audience on your platform. For that amount, i would go for the best laptop within that price. But honestly, until Tablets can have the EXACT or more power as a full flagship laptop, then tablets will always be obsolete.  But the form factor is better if tech can get there. you can buy a top end laptop or pc for that price That spec and performance seems unreal with stunning picture quality, actually looking forward to seeing you get your hands on it and doing a full review. It&#39;s either a sarcastic comment or a bad take. I’ll take your macbook if you don’t need it, please, thanks wait, is the apple pencil now more thicker than the IPad????? Just give the users the option to use IDEs on iPads like Xcode or vscode natively and you’ll see a lot of new users getting iPads instead of computers Damn Arun , it&#39;s your first time reviewing an ipad Apple are literally laughing all the way to the bank. People are so misguided now they&#39;re paying $3k for a flipping tablet. Very few people are. You can get an iPad for $349 FYI So we don&#39;t need to buy a MacBook. I can&#39;t wait for the launch of the new Macbooks and then hear what all the YouTubers have to say about them compared to iPads. 😂 Again, another Awesome vid from Mrwhosetheboss The content is always amazing always getting better and better, can&#39;t wait to see you overpass Apple in subcribers. bs Give me MacOS and i might consider buying it I&#39;m still using ipad mini 6. It&#39;s good enough.<br>N my s24 There&#39;s rarely a bad take here but when there is it kills lol I really need the new iPad it’s awesome but I can’t afford it 😂 Hey man I watch your videos a lot and I like them very much because of the pace colors and themes and something just disappeared in this video most of those things actually <br>I mean the music was nice in the dark background is pretty cool but it&#39;s not your style it feels scripted from Apple😅<br><br>But nothing too much just an insight form me to one of my favorite YouTuber <br>Good luck with designing your new place 👍 Apple devices and whatever chip they make are not worth it if u wanna game. Apple products only work great with apple made apps (which u dont get with the product and gotta buy it separately). These rigged up things by apple nowadays make me hate this company more and more. Those blacks are so deep 💀 I actually tried using the previous iPad Pro as a laptop replacement for 2 months at the end of last year and my conclusion is that it is not ready for that and probably never will be. Here’s my list of issues:<br>1) Stage manager is still fiddly and managing apps when you have a lot of them open is both quite restricted and a lot of effort (e.g. having more than one instance of the same app).<br>2) A lot of apps are simply not designed for using a mouse+keyboard meaning you have to lift your hands and touch the screen for sometimes basic actions (including in the OS itself).<br>3) using an external monitor is not very good because (i) it sometimes crashes and all open apps move to the iPad screen meaning you have to click the 3 dots on top and move them to external monitor; (ii) issues 1) and 2) get magnified; (iii) personally I hate how the OS manages workspaces/virtual desktops independently in each screen which means you have to click way more often than what I am used to on other OS.<br>4) you always depend on apps to do everything, which can get expensive but also makes working on it (as a programmer) not very good (due to lack of a basic console and other features of more open OS).<br>5) lack of ports… it has 1 USB-C, which means you NEED a dongle or a dock at all times if you need to plug in 2 things or more, or 1 thing + charge.<br>6) Pencil is good but if you want to use it intermittently for typing + drawing, then be prepared to fiddle around until the OS recognizes that you don’t want to use the pencil anymore. This is worse when not having a keyboard connected.<br>7) I wholeheartedly disagree with your assertion that programs are developed with apps as a focus. This might be true for entertainment but if you actually want to do work on iPad OS, you will find that these apps have countless limitations (lack of features) and annoyances and are generally much slower than their laptop/desktop counterpart.<br><br>Hopefully this stuff gets better with time but I realized that this is unlikely. Apple doesn’t want the iPad to be a competitor to the MacBooks and vice-versa; they don’t want the iPad to become the “MacBook with touch”. They want you to buy both and an iPhone. I think you will find that big phone + laptop is a much better and flexible combination that achieves 95% of what’s needed, making the iPad almost redundant. Any other combination of 2 of these products satisfies a lower % of what you need. The <b>only</b> exception being that if you need the Pencil to make money, then you should get the iPad. Otherwise, spare the 2k+. Mobile apps but bigger 😂😂<br>Also why send photos to iPad to edit if you already have a MacBook <br>Also an ipad for 3600 dollar is just overrated My girlfriend got me into apple from android as a pilot and a truck driver I find the apps better for flying and driving and it’s more secure than android Bro buys and makes a video about a new product before I even know that there&#39;s a new product. Love that Arun is branching out from just reviewing phones. From a ipad, mac, windows user. There are just some inconveniences using ipad as a laptop replacement. Mainly due to ipados. I tried. But it just doesnt. I bought a Dell 2 in 1 for 600 and put Linux mint on it. The UI is acceptable for touch and the writing apps are absolutely amazing. It has a many core amd and I just used to do my thesis in Matlab and Vivado this thin thing is a beast.<br><br>This was 3 years ago and still use it daily I think that Apple will need to make fundamental changes to how standoffish they are as a company to tempt the wider gaming market to offer its products on their platforms. 3k wtf I was thinking maybe I should move to apple I wanted to use a tablet but I spending that when I can get 2 gaming laptops FYI you can get a brand new iPad for $349 BUT CAN IT RUN WARZONE MOBILE😂 it probably can , its ios so well optimised I used to watch Arun because of his unbiased and honest reviews <br>This whole video feels like a paid promotion <br>He is over hyping the basic features So are you gonna switch to an iPhone since the iPad works better with an iPhone than an Android? can&#39;t wait for foldgate 2 pro max £3600 to play Warzone mobile is insane I feel still iPad Pro 2018 holds up pretty well and does the average daily stuff without any flaws. The chips do not actually make anything better unless you are editing videos or photos on iPads and at that point macs and MacBooks does it better. It cannot over come being a secondary device at any point of time because of iPad os limitations. the meat riding is crazy can&#39;t wait for jerry rig&#39;s video 😂 Bwat That thing is going to bend when JerryRigEverything breathes near it... Boss i dont know if wheter your editing had little time to put this video out because of the announcement, im pretty sure you guys could have gotten an NDA before it was announced for you to drop videos the same day, but i appreciate the less &quot;in your face brainrot&quot; editing, without letters coming out every time you mention a feature or something not that important, and the vfx also more toned down. you will always be the GOAT man Bro thought we wouldn&#39;t see what he was doing to that toothbrush Samsung tablets are so much better Apple is overrated. No tablet should cost over $4 grand. You can buy the best of the best pc tower/pc laptop for that including a 4090 and top newest intel/amd cpu ect. Good luck getting anywhere near that power with any crap apple product Almost everything you said about the magic keyboard was already available on the old one but nice vid! I&#39;m so upset that the new Apple Pencil Pro is only available for the new iPads. I assume that my iPad Pro M2 can handle the Apple pencil Pro. 3600$ ? Km good with my OnePlus pad What game is this at 1.04, I feel like I’ve played this a long time ago Apple innovation : make AIR bigger &amp; heavier. Make PRO thinner &amp; lighter. 😏 Ill suggest arun to watch mkbhd before buying one🤓 Well cause u can afford it lol it’s like getting to Apple vision price😂 Im a non apple guy Hi sir i really request if u could help me out by buying me an iPhone for a gaming purpose please i would pay u later after i win i am searching a sponsor so please help me sir i really really needed a phone for the tournament please sir I am not convinced to pay 300% extra profit margin to Tim for Samsung screen. There are Oled tablets available out there for £150 like Samsung S5e. Can you review Huawei Pura 70 ultra This seems like an ad, not a genuine review or reaction. I&#39;ve had several iPads, and a mini. The new iPad Pro is just the usual spec bump. iPads have their place; if you need one you need one, as I do for working on the run. But always, a laptop is better, and a Mac on my desk with a great screen is light years better than an iPad or laptop. Is this &quot;The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&quot;? I can&#39;t believe anyone is honestly excited here. It&#39;s kind of like a new iPhone release; how exciting, really? ... when there is little ever anything new. Honestly the workflow described in the video has been there since the M1 Pros launched. Nothing new here. Yes the software has improved but there are still major drawbacks to using the iPad as a macbook replacement. Such as:<br>- Battery life<br>- Input lag in stage manager<br>- That weird round mouse &quot;pointer&quot; no precise clicking possible<br>- Bad files system<br>- No clamshell mode<br>- Low support outside of content apps<br>- Safari acting buggy as hell since iPad OS 17<br>- A single usb-c<br><br>......

Overrated Price lol is same crap as samsung s8 tablet lol The unfortunate reality is that a good portion of the buyers for this iPad will never unlock and use its full potential. But Apple is as much a luxury brand / lifestyle company as it is a tech giant, so I digress.<br><br>The truth is that for most casual consumers the PC era ended recently or is going to end soon. As a student I see more and more people using tablet folios or Surface products for note taking and simple browsing / video streaming. And other than workers in the tech / IT industry and PC gamers or enthusiasts, literally no one seems to be adopting laptops / desktops as the first choice over tablets, handhelds, and consoles. Rightfully so, because if you don&#39;t need the power you shouldn&#39;t spend the money for power but for other things that matter like portability, battery life, usability, e.t.c.<br><br>Nonetheless I am looking forward to Apple shills telling me they need this M4 chip for their intense 8 hour on the desk word / excel / YT / gaming workload when they could have easily bought an older equally viable ipad and hooked it up to an amazing display for home use for much cheaper. Or better yet just but two devices for two separate purposes (productivity and media consumption) for a cheaper combo price. For storage consider getting a NAS storage in place if you have a high end data connection. Quite modular and reliable without paying for a cloud subscription. Definitely benefits you over a period. If this comment gets 10,000 likes then I will tell my crush I like her Wait... so my real money is worth less than UK money? I remember when you could buy an iPad for 500$ no. I made it at the 59th minute!! For that price I could get a single CDJ 3000 by Pioneer and about a 100 songs from Beatport. iPads are good for two things: Drawing with ProCreate (see my avatar) and watching videos or movies. You can&#39;t burn USBs, program, or build and compile anything on an iPad. On a Mac, you can. Imagine writing dense Rust or C on an iPad. Me watching this on iphone 5 Battery life is not quite my expectation Really hoping that the M4 series doesn&#39;t run as hot as the M3.

I mean 2018 ipad pro is still powerfull, and like then now still ipadOS is tablet OS, and unless they do something with v18 its not a laptop, no mater how powerfull it is. Plus the whole thing with size and new pencil connections so you have to buy new stuff is such apple move. Its fast enough, you can get docks and hubs but still Thinnest ever? I don&#39;t get why we accept the premise that thinner is better, OR the premise that the thickness of an object is not determined by the thicket point, which is the camera bump which does not need to exist. If the whole of our phones and tablets were thicker we wouldn&#39;t need cases to make the back flat so it rests properly on a flat surface, would have better antenna, SD card readers, internal stylus, better cooling solutions and bigger batteries and they&#39;d <b>still</b> be incredibly thin. <br><br>Just mock the obsession with thinness and with &#39;new&#39; versions of blue and green every year.

Arun the type of guy all the &quot;drake the type of guy&quot; suits him With that money, I could feed my cats, for the rest of their lives.<br><br>🙄🙄🙄 It’s funny to me how similar my thought process was before i purchased my m2 ipad pro. I obsessed for a while before making the purchase into finding out the pro’s and cons of the device. What software it supported and how well it worked and even if i could use a third party mechanical keyboard or mouse on it without too much hassle. I had a samsung tab s7 before but it was simply too slow and unresponsive for what i wanted to do, not to mention the s-pen would stop at random during the drawing of lines. But as soon as i tried and eventually purchased the ipad it became my main creative device. Presenting iScam Air and iScam Pro I just instead of I&#39;ve just...your producer must be from north America (most likely from the USA) 😬 don&#39;t americanise your English mate @arun what game are you playing in this video i would never give my kid this expensive tablet just for him to watch skibidi toilet Actually what you’re saying here is NOT the reason to get the M4 but more of a reason for you to get an iPad Pro. You can do the same thing with a M1 or M2 iPad. To upgrade from the previous gen… meh.. gimmicky to be honest. I want to aim $500 budget laptop and this tablet is almost 8x more expensive than my dream😂😂 Wow thats insane also I love your videos the pace of them is perfect I bought my iPad last year and I basically use it as an overpriced notebook. It literally cannot do what a laptop does in terms of work or a phone in terms of efficiency regardless of how it’s marketed. Honestly I don&#39;t normally like Apple, I&#39;m a Google guy but seriously I&#39;m impressed 👍 Amoled finally 😂. I just bought a galaxy book 2 360. I sold my tablet a while ago .. but now I&#39;ll be studying medicine. And I need something like this in my opinion... So basically you get a lot of high-end hardware that the software does not make use of. In short,  unless you have some very specific use cases, you will see no difference from the M1 Ipad Pro.  Apple will never open IpadOS to really take advantage of the hardware, as that would eat into their Macbook Air sales :))) Now some android person will come and start trash talking about apple coz why not 😂. Then some apple user come and talk shit about Android.

This is really cool but it&#39;s an Apple product so unfortunately it&#39;s useless. In terms of gaming on MacOS, i think it&#39;ll help if more games are ported from iOS and iPadOS to the Mac. For example, codm on a mac. I think that&#39;ll give more Mac users a lot of options when it comes to gaming. That Motorola Xoom was great was thinking if make it so thin if goes wrong Apple will be the only place to fix it as in re your video about broken phones theres no point if you cant run macos apps on it Mark my words, you will not give up your laptop.

If only iPad can run PS2 or PS3 Emulator, that M4 chip would be a good use and not such a waste considering how powerful that is compared to the current Snap 8 gen 2 on the galaxy Tab S9 ultra. You broke down the pros and cons perfectly! Bro, i just bought the new ipad, but it doesnt look like that, they said it was Iped prO? Most powerful device for mobile game <br>Without emulator detection I remember wanting an iPad when I was younger and thinking $300 was a lot. This is just ridiculous... while the ipad pro is very tempting even for me i gave up on it for multiple reasons, first one is it doesnt fix my issue, i need to have one device with sim active at all times also connected to wifi/celular , meaning ipad will not fix my issue forcing me to buy a second iphone pro max, when all your data is on device it is a priority to have access to it at any time, as for me it has 2 light pros rest are cons, one being extension for iphone and extension for mac yes it is usefull but for that price why should i add an extra device i need to babysit,, and finally is oled and 120hz pro motion this is without a doubt best display but sadly even if i game on iphone i do it for less than a hour daily, as for cons as i meantioned before, it is not an individual device like mac or iphone it forces you to have one or the orther to work, second is you cant use iphone sim to make calls, lastly if you want to do that or have celular you need pay extra for it, another con for me it is hard to carry and find a use to get value out of the 2000$ it costs without accesories, even with i cant find a good use for. I didn’t think I needed a Pro iPad, but I got the one with the M1 chip and never wanted to use my MacBook again. Now, it is just a paperweight. But the iPad is my primary device It’s interesting how as Arun is going from Mac to iPad, I’m trying to go from iPad to Mac, offloading as many things as I do on an iPad on to my MacBook and iPhone I see how some of the comments are copied from the mkbhd video on iPad...

My tablet is $200 (Lenovo), and the keyboard was $50 off ebay. I&#39;m pretty sure it will do 98% of what this tablet does, and I know it does 100% of what I want it to do. So, is the extra 2% this thing can do really worth $2500 (or whatever it is). Will this thing really be attractive to people other than a) uber rich (status chasers?) , b) fanboys or c) artists/content creators? I can&#39;t imagine them selling many of these things. I&#39;m probably really missing something....and I&#39;m not trying to be an anti-apple jerk here; some of the new tech is interesting.There must be value I just can&#39;t appreciate. I hope. I get I&#39;m &quot;not the market for this&quot;....but...who the hell is? I could never justify spending that much on a tablet unless they put Mac OS on it because iPad OS is so extremely limited on what you can and cannot do with them. I still don&#39;t understand why Apple doesn&#39;t just ship them with Mac OS.

Apple doesn&#39;t want people to only buy their iPad but also MacBook because of ipad os, but if other companies come up with an xElite processor and Windows on their tablet, then Apple should consider adding macOS to their iPad. That way, consumers would benefit from having full desktop experience on their tablet.

Now when you want to buy the new apple pencil you have to buy the new iPad and now your old magic keyboard doesn&#39;t work with the new iPad so you buy the new magic keyboard, Now when you want to transfer files you realize you need to airdrop, now you go and buy the iPhone 15, then you want to workout but your old watch doesn&#39;t work with your new iPhone 15, then you buy the new apple watch series 9, now you want to listen to music so you decide to buy the new airpods and then when you walk pass the apple store and decide to go in, then you see a MacBook, but it is angeled in a way such that you can&#39;t use the device properly, then you decide to change the angel and you accidently touch it and a few minutes late you walk out with a brand new MacBook. Later that day you get a call from work saying there have been a virus gotten into a PC, then you go back into the apple store and buy 10 of the latest iMacs and also remembers that you hate getting out of bed to switch of the lights, so then you decide to also get yourself 3 Homepods and 2 Homepod minis and decides to get a another MacBook and an iMac for yourself aswell. Then you see the apple vision pro so you decide to play around with it for a while and then your fingers decides to press the buy button, then before you leave you decide to get accessories,  cases, charging wires, charging blocks and an Apple TV 4K. Then you get a call from the bank saying that you are broke!🤑 okey finally first real pro device from apple.

For how long is this going to be good and usable tho I have a hard time trusting apple I have used a lot of products from both sides.<br>Let me tell you something Apple lasted long and did better(most of the time) All these people lining up to paint Tim Cook’s fence… Most powerful youtube and netflix device Apple will not make you replace your MacBook because they still want the profit. It will definitely not be like how iPhone replace iPod. wtf theres M4 now? who the heck needs that much power on a tablet i would love to hear an update video on things like how threads is doing and other stuff you&#39;ve talked about Way better than mkbhd video For me visual studio code’s missing is the only thing that is stopping me from getting an ipad. Then it would be the perfect school device for me Bro keeps reminding me about my bank balance 🗿 Fr Compare it to the Galaxy Tab S9 ultra <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=757\">12:37</a> 😭👍🏿 This is literally apple pumping out trash n their fan boys eating it like itz a 5 star meal. HOW IS ZZZ ON THAT IPAD Imagine if Apple lets iPad run windows 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂windows laptop cannibalism 😂😂😂 I love this set of the video. Nice one! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Ayo! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=42\">0:42</a> well now we know how he gets free products from tim cook &quot;Small cars worth&quot;? You can get 7 cars at that price Becoz u have mony to spend...😆😆😆😆😆 Waiting for the final experience review from Arun. Overall this video was enough to ignite the fire of excitement 🎉 so??? you made tis video.... and got the tablet for free.... smart Don&#39;t fall for such promotions. 90% don&#39;t need a tablet let alone a tablet that costs a fortune.60%of us don&#39;t even need a laptop,we buy them but don&#39;t need them.A good fone is more then enough these days. These youtubers will brag about tiny bits of a product and when a new one launches they will tell u how the old one was lacking and this new one is the answer to all your problems. The cycle repeats for every product. DONT BE SO INSECURE, DONT BUY SHIT U DNT NEED. i dislike using apple products due to the fact that there is so much proprietary  stuff and i quite enjoy fixing and programming my own things not taking it to the apple store and having them fix it for me Ok, But this video is now about tablets in general instead of the m4 ipad. Which is clearly in line with apple&#39;s marketing forcing you to think their products are what define a product segment. And hence, allowing them to change that definition anytime its convenient.<br><br>The fact remains that this product only exists because of the void between iPhone and macbook that apple themselves actively maintain by shaving of features from both in order to widen the gap. Too optimistic. The hardware is good, but it&#39;s still an iPad. Edit: Did they miss a page in thermodynamics?<br>What are they(apple) redefining physics and thermodynamics, get real thermally its gone be suffering. Why I just bought it: because I&#39;m a tech reviewer thats really expensive lol Same review every year. Great tablet but can’t replace a mac. When apple discontinues Macs then you’ll get a crossover. Until then they have to sell their laptops as well. In the future the iPads might get discontinued and they&#39;ll make touch screen macbooks. Tablet was invented for clash of clans players...!!! I&#39;ll afford to buy this 5 years from now😏 This man’s videos are the best ngl You have been paid well...its an IPAD😀 Ipad OS is still very limiting, when will we get the option to run macOS on an iPad apple? feel sorry from apple haters.. 🤣🖕 The design is so much like the Galaxy tab S9 Dude the fact you can buy a good laptop for the price of this iPad is insane Close to a vision pro to!

Arun has a fan base race with apple and also making a video highlighting the iPad over MacBook<br><br>I mean should we support apple by subscribing them or Arun????? Codm players getting ready to buy😂 Thinnest iPad is cool...what can it do? I’m going to be honest, I feel the exact opposite way. The iPad is what I currently have and I am trying to get a MacBook. Yes iPad does allow you to download things and is quite portable, whilst having all the other benefits of being an iPad. BUT. There are many issues with them. For one, battery life. If you’re ever even doing anything remotely intense you get about 4 or under hours of battery life. That is not enough to consider portable. You also are not only going to need a MacBook to run Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, there’s also a subscription fee on top of that to be able to use it vs on MacBook it’s a one time purchase. It also is quite a bit less powerful, which you mentioned, but honestly living with one you can sometimes feel it. Obviously it does insanely well for an iPad but it just isn’t really enough if you’re doing much editing or anything graphic intensive. Plus, it’s extremely easy to break and crack which I can only imagine is much more of an issue on the new one. MacBooks are also probably quite easy to break but atleast they have a cover on so you get some protection where there is none on an iPad. And, on top of that while yes it does run games it is like any other apple product. Not really the best. I do have to admit I am very lucky to have one and it is really fun and useful but it just isn’t really enough and I can imagine you would use it for much more graphic intensive things than I would. Obviously do whatever you believe is best for you, that’s just my opinion. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. I just started to be in Apple environment and now this thing came out. By the way, good and useful information you’ve provided! Might consider this as an option😄 break it I’m debating between the 11” and the 13” model. Any thoughts? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9cmoZFJTD4&amp;t=731\">12:11</a> that guy trying to get a shot and the people looking at him 😂😂 Are they brining out the ipad pro 14.1 inch 2028 landfill stuff any coating on an oled screen is counterproductive in my opinion.

I already have a Mac and this is not meant to replace that. It’s meant to work TOGETHER with the Apple ecosystem and be the best media device which you can occasionally use for work as well. Yes, it’s a luxury device and way too expensive, but it’s just so much fun to use and worth it for me. For what . What is this new m4 pro proforma on the iPad that can&#39;t be done better anywhere else, or same on last gen? Worth nothing \\u200b@@MrDragonorpbro it not some revolutionary step. It does everything the old can do but faster and uses less power. Also the m4 is future proof. It&#39;s not a mini pc @@_Meme_lord_1agreed, if you don’t like it, just don’t buy it. i can see this being a big step up for artists since the oled screen will give you accurate colors when drawing and the new apple pencil will be nice as well. just because it doesn’t fit YOUR needs doesn’t mean you have to talk it down. @@devilofgenisis cry Yeah bro, you are not gonna switch to this full-time any time soon. OS is the biggest drawback. Bro I’m watching this on an Ipad Really wish Apple would enable a MacOS option for iPad Pro.  My M2 iPad is already more power than I can use while limited to iPadOS and it’s always a little frustrating. <br><br>There’s got to be a market out there for a touchscreen enabled MacBook that works with Apple Pencil - this would easily be filled with a MacOS enabled iPad plus Magic Keyboard.  Maybe that’s why it hasn’t happened because it would cannibalise MacBook sales. When the AI apocalypse hits, smart homes will be the first to fall.  LOL I have never wanted a tablet again this bad. Of course I will still hold my MacBook close to my heart, not to mention it houses all of my folders and Google Documents and I use Studio One 6 on it. But if I want/need a similar form factor, but don&#39;t require the bulkiness and hardware required for more demanding work, and just want something for light work and mostly social media and whatnot, this and the magic keyboard are right up my alley.<br><br><i>I&#39;ll just wait a few years until they&#39;re being sold for cheaper.</i> But seriously, I dig this. Amazing work as always, Arun I&#39;ve seen people review it too! 𝙃𝙞 You’ll be surprised how limited the iPad actually is because of iPadOS. I love ipads , can&#39;t wait to buy this one , ill exchange my older one for this if they let me As a guy who use the latest Samsung tablet (tab S9) i think a causal user (which most of us are) we Don&#39;t need the latest and greatest.i think if you are going for apple you can still get the 90 % experience with the air or the M 1 and M 2 for  the half of the prize or less, i used to think Ipad was the way but i bought a samsung tablet because it gives me a wayy better screen than the ipad for almost half the price and also i Don&#39;t need the Macbook level of power because i would be watching content and playing casal games anyway.also Ipad air probably has a 60hz screen which is a big no no and ite dosent even come with the pencil. A sub to the channel would be.. reMACable😉 Watching this on my Xiaomi pad 5. Yes, weight is a major factor. But I get almost the same experience at a fraction of the iPad cost. Hamaaanm] It needs UTM at least and because of the EU, that should be coming soon DONT buy new ipads,<br>go for android if you want amoled display and go for ipad air m1 if you want an ipad.<br>dont complicate things, its as simple and straightforward as it can ever get. So Tablets are stupid expensive now i can just imagine when going into an apple store to purchase this, you will go up to the desk, and they will promptly ask you for your bank-account number. I was 50/50 on getting the new iPad Pro, but this video convinced me since I didn’t want a laptop MacBook nerfed Can you like this comment for no reason....? iOS is built for <b>mobile</b> games.

For example Photoshop which I use daily lacking so many features it makes it fairly useless.<br><br>Will not buy a new ipad pro unless all 3 above is seen, if they happen, maybe i will replace my macbook pro 16. Best all round video so far. Not sure myself and the pricing these days for pro stuff from Apple is just crazy Android:  just bcz expensive doesent mean its better🍷. We have nokia which is the real deal and we have the biggest tablet samsung.

       "'39 million views We paid for this video by views alone Imma hop on CODM with this MF 😂😂😂 Dude ipad software is even worse than macbook and even more limited Wait how much does this cost that toothbrush scene was fascinating 😂 Wtf 3600 I39d rather upgrade my pc and the rest money i39ll buy an android What writing Tablet is the one u used Really interesting takeI don39t use my phone for anything if I can help it  I even use my laptop to send texts because the tiny keyboard is useless to me  When websites try to send me to apps I get really annoyed  And of course this is AppleI won39t use apple products if I can help it  Unless you are doing video editing or graphic design they are pretty useless In my country there is 2200 if you convert this into Kuwaiti dinar i swear😮😮 Wow Apple fans are a really really strange group of people Why I have a 2 in 1 pc Gets me all the advantages of a tablet as a PC The reality is I do a lot of coding and running various virtual machines and all the applications I use work perfectly on PC Are we just going to ignore the toothbrush at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a Ok everything is fine but what brand or mpdel is ypur sweatshirt 😂 How do i get that Pokemon starter apple watch face As someone who understands the technology  I would obviously never buy an Apple product But as someone who understands profits over people I39ve bought a decent amount of Apple stock So I think apple is great and everyone should buy one 2600 dollars My names Kade a great videographer and photographer here to tell you this will take up space in my inventory as a creator because I have a PC and MSI gaming laptop I was here for the screen colors and debating if I wanted a iPhone color profile screen to edit photos on😂 not worth it to me Okay how did I not know that writing tablets are a thing I honestly prefer going to a website on my mobile devices compared to an app because storage management is something I really struggle with and websites barely take up any storage compared to the app So did you take it on the aisle😂 347 If apple comes out with a foldable the size of the z fold  Game over You spent 3600 bucks because you can afford it We can’t Prices are becoming obscene But as long as there are people willing and able to pay them there’s clearly a market for these super inflated prices My ipad 2018 is stuck in boot loop 😢😢😢😢😢brThe price of ipad has sky rocketed Arjun is becoming an I pad kid Bro literally convinced himself to buy the iPad For the large iPad Pro’s Apple should be ashamed for not including a 30W charger That was one of my very first purchases along with a 6 ft white extension cord Apple used to make for the Mac’s The 6 foot white extension cord into the 30W Mac charging brick out to a 3 ft Amazon Basics braided USBC cord is a must for conveniently staying charged while on the couch and a must accessory for traveling I have an iPad Pro 129 5th Generation with 1 TB I don’t see anything compelling enough to make a change I have the keyboard case so the weight difference would be insignificant and the screen display would only be marginally better and I would be concerned about burn in Imagine if the burn in was slightly different on the two layers That would be a real mess Where can I download those 3600 to me living in Indonesia doesn39t sound all that expensive if an average wage earner earns just as low as 2000 in USAbrbrHere the price of a new iPhone could be 45x the low average wage worker here Bro39s video quality even on 360p on my phone🫡🫡❤ There is a sucker born every minute That39s apple for ya a rip off It could bend like paper and it’s battery could be 🐶💩 in comparison I think should have just packed it with a m3 like it may be that powerful but all you can do with that much power is play triple aaa games that only support m1 but there’s less than 10 games that actually require a m1 The iPad only 1568 I once had a hauwei smart phone and it was bent almost like a half circle and it still worked didn39t lagg nothing In my country if i max out the ipad pro m4 it will cost 39k and that with tax included That cost more then building a midrange desktop and buying macbook pro or the air Like wtf apple This is not gonna replace macbooks my ass lol Your rich and they paid you sorry they suck and you know it Apple is the evil 😈 you have to pay so money subscription  Who watches this guy Pass a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt345545a That whole segment was funny to me especially the “wow” 😂 Don’t get me wrong This is a truly great device  and nothing like it  I respectfully have to disagree with this video and amount spent on something like this Good luck trying to make it work This so called “work around” you are trying to pursue unless they change the concept of iPad OS will be a awful miserable  attempt coming from my experience of 2 years trying to make the iPad Pro 129 which I was glad to get rid of and change for a MacBook Air this year  at least for my use case as daily computer and logic humans are intuitive we feel comfortable touching the screen using tablet keyboardespecially chilling out  harder to relax using a mac too clunky can imaging people buying this to connect to their top spec imac and use with touch people like to flex their cash on these productsunless you do loads of video editing or word processingneed loads of storage and like to do many things while waiting on videos processing it’s a hell of a lot of cash plush you’ll need pencil pro new keypadcase  if you need it for work and can use it for leisure fair enough if you need to upgrade never worked out how dollar price equals pound price Product price 3600brWhat customers getbrUSB 20 480 MbpsbrBattery 10290 mAhbr20W USBC adapter actually receives 35Wbr3600 🤣🤣🤣🤣 With 188M subs he either git the ipad for free or hes banking  I only imagine the car he drives Why you started mimic of Marques brownlee I spent less money on my gaming beast PC than this tiny little screen would cost What a scam With the newest advancements in chipsets and tech I want a 17quot tablet that is faster and more powerful than my current 2022 Dell XPS 9710 I also want a laptop style keyboard dock which has a builtin extra battery supply for the tablet to add use time The tablet would need to have a couple Thunderbolt 4 ports so I can connect a USB hub and drives an extra monitor and supply power Oh and I definitely want it to be not an Apple I feel like you converted the nearly £2900 of your specced iPad to dollars just to make the video sound extra quotclickablequot like quot3000quot didn39t sound catchy enough so you had to stretch it to 3600brbrThe iPad Pro 11 inch and 13 inch costs £999  £1299 respectively in the UK In the US they cost 999  1299brbrYour £2877 iPad Pro costs 2877 in the US I understand that you want the currency in the title to be widely understood but adding an over 600 markup doesn39t make sense herebrbrAnd yes you could say quotI39m only converting it to dollars to the viewers have an accurate idea as to how much I ACTUALLY paid in my currency when convertedquot but that logic also wouldn39t make sense here If I were to buy an iPad Pro in Denmark with the same configuration that you selected I39d be paying 29297 Danish Kroner When converted to dollars I get 4271 Buying a max spec iPad Pro in Denmark costs an additional 1394 when compared to the USbrbrSo in some other Universe a Danish MrWhoseTheBoss could title their video quotWhy I spent 4271 on the iPad Pro M4quot And while they wouldn39t be wrong when talking about how much they paid in their currency when converted to dollars Denmark has less than 002 the population the US does so talking about the iPad Pro39s cost in Danish Kroner doesn39t make sense to your viewers who would be paying 1400 LESS for the EXACT same machinebrbrEven the UK only has 20 the population the US does so it really isn39t fair to talk about the cost of the iPad using British Pounds as if you convert the currency you end up tacking an extra 600 onto the cost out of nowhere I feel that next time if you want to use dollars in your title to describe the cost of something you bought to your main audience US viewers you should get the figure based on how much the item costs in the US instead of how much you actually paid and then convertingbrbrIt39s more work but it39s more honest and I feel like that39s more important than making the video sound extra clickable Can you do a video on iPad Air It’s just like a Vision Pro for your hands hahaha Good evening are you doing anything with the Xiaomi Mix Fold 4 good advertisment for ipad I think this a solid buy if you don’t already have a laptop or computer This is solid for maybe like a designer or artist of some sort but for daily use it seems way more cumbersome ironic bc it’s so thin but I’d rather use the laptop where it feels all together where this device is like holding the worst part of a MacBook Like I dunno iPads are cool for legit drawing and watching stuff 3600 is like a 2010 Prius lol Jesus is the way the truth and the life No one get to the Father except through him DO A GIVE AWAWY IF YIU WANNA BEAT THE APPLE Tbf its got less ports which i think is important 1 i dont like trackpads 2 I do actully use the HDMI and Ethernet ports I also find that for most people who are gamees they are probably not gaming on a Mac a PC or Linux machine would do you better since more stuff is designed to work on those it even feels like steam cares more about Linux than Mac at this point Perfect use of ‘filthy casual’ as long as people like you keeps buying it with that price they won39t integrate MacOS and iPadOS never Most overrated tech youtuber who doesn39t know bs about tech Because you have 3600 to spend on it That pencil is in the perfect place to be stolen and it is expensive so that makes it even more appealing And the iPad could probably just slip out of your hand and fall or get taken by a thief And just 3 weeks later he wants Them to fix it I thought Mrwhosetheboss was in the UK Planes rhapsody2612 All of his videos refer to cost and value in … I’m sure he doesn’t fly to America every time he makes a video… mrfust  he is infrom the ukbut most of his audience is from america 1236dxx But Americans surely have access to currency conversion tools mrfust yes but it would be easier when a LOT of ur audience is from the us and i do notice whenever he does puts it in pounds some1 is gonna complain why it isnt in dollars All the discussions about luxury brands are summed up as brIf you39re very rich why not brIf you39re not rich and you buy it you39re incredibly dumb I use cellular data All the people in the comments saying that this sounds like a sponsored video  can he not enjoy things 😭 I still use a iPad… hey buddy can I tell you I gone one iPad Pro not the one that u buy Wait M4 Just in November I got an M3 MacBook Pro brWHEN DID THE M4 CHIP COME OUT i39ll wait for 10K ipad then As much as I like iPadOs all the features you described are completely dumb without an unrestricted OS I believe Microsoft won this year The new Surface is nearly as fast pencil and case keyboard compatible pretty good screen also and guess what you can actually do really work on it Not to mention the price a

screens I bought the top of the line sony OLED and it’s better than my 5000 TV so now I find myself watching movies in my iPad and tv off in the background and the iPad in my lapgt I don39t like your review at all because it39s not fun to talk too much Apple is a 🤡 can you post a link where you got the writing tablet from please Microsoft has had tablet PCs for years Its nothing revolutionary I

Next video “Why I returned my 3600 iPad” Would love to hear your view on the upcoming Windows Surface Pro 11 I39m sure iPad will give the more refined tablet experience at least for a recreational

work over the road a lot and 99 of the time instead of getting my work laptop out I just grab my iPad Mini to write a quote or check on a job or what ever I justified my purchase because of this I use my phone for a hotspot and having my iPad instantly connect when I pull it out of my bag is a huge plus My windows laptop is a pain in the ass most of the time to get to connect to my phone for internet 3600 is not a lot for an iPad and plus that39s small amount In general Sarcastic can you do a review on the tab s9 Ultra a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt332532a I love how when discussing doing work on a device literally all youtubers talk about video and photo editing as if that is what we all work on 😂 That’s because they’re making the video recapping their experiences and not ours so video and photo editing would be part of doing their work Imagine using one the finest brains in the field of engineering just to trim down the size of a product by a few mm 😑😑 A feature which no one gives a damn after a point Basically millions of dollars spent so that people can save probably 34mm space in their backpack Giving a M4 chipset in a machine which lacks the software capability to utilize it brThese things are what is exactly wrong with Apple and the cause of their doom They are spending resources in places where it is not required All this gimmick is what causes the price of an Apple product to rise which in itself makes it irrational for many people video started in the afternoon and ended at night Even as a millionaire I would never waste 3600 on a tablet

on an iPad if you want to move files around within your device and to any other compatible device The biggest real annoyance for me is the inability to move files to and from every other app on the device Many apps are sandboxed For instance my third party alarm clock only plays clips from Music and cannot even see anything from VLC The other annoyance is the inability to just add media files to Music from other apps without having to connect to a Mac or other 39master39 computer add the music to the computer39s version of Music and then 39sync39 the iPad to it It39s very inconvenient and clunky whilst requiring you to have either another computer for the job or to buy media from Apple39s online store Binge watching Mrwhosetheboss😂❤ Modern smartphone screens are too big They don39t fit into pockets easily are difficult for someone with smaller hands to hold easily and are often too large for some wireless chargers If I want a good sized screen size in a lightweight device with a decent onscreen keyboard and excellent battery life I buy a tablet Like the one I39m using now If I want complete portable computer functionality I buy a laptop My MBP battery also lasts all day I have the iPad Pro from 2019 It still operates like it39s brand new I have no reason to upgrade Great you can afford it the rest of us are surviving on a day to day basis The priority is to have a roof over your head and to have food on the table The rest such as apple us just bullshit Shilly review I need your review for tab s9 ultra 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 you can make an iPad if your phone sells well😀 Just ordered the new iPad Pro m4 I don’t need one as I already have an iPad 10th gen but WTH why not lol Which is when you convert from Dollar3600 to Rupees₹299 016 which is I mean that is just an obscene amount to pay for a tablet brbrWhile i pay ₹27000 for a phone and thought it was ridiculous expensivebrBroke meliterally dying inside Anyone who uses quotsmartquot everything is not a bright cookie Anyone else watching this on an iPad Just buy last gen 😩 that toothbrush scene always irritates me 😂 Is this cool Yeah But most people buying this probably wouldn’t notice if it were switched out with an ipad air Such a poor decision but then again 36k is chump change for him You have wasted your money Please come back with a video comparing the base model to the spec that you have purchased hey man hey man Mrwhosetheboss Why I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4brEveryone For Content farming 😅😅 what am I doing here i dont even have an iphone never used any ios device iPad OS can’t do what Mac OS does My CRM system has versions for both I can only do document and email merges on  Mac OS There is nothing better than walking around your house with your iPhone on a MagSafe charger and using the larger screen and desktoplike robustness of an iPad I know you’re saying the tablet is actually not a more robust experience and maybe that’s true of Android tablets but I suspect you’re just being unfair Hey Mrwhosetheboss I39m George from Namibia in Africa I wanted to ask if you would please send me an iphone so I start my own YouTube channel 🙏 Can i have your macbook will this work with 10th gen Its quite funny bc my fyp on tik tok is all abaut how the m4 ipad is better than the S9tab ultra lol poeapole dont understand that the ipda uses a laptop chip lol meanwhile the S9Tab ultra uses an mobile chip İ thought m4 you know the car bmw m4 competition We need to stop getting so wowed by thin electronics it hurts durability and increases repair difficulty IPhone or ipad not like because more things are free on Android The funny thing is when there is so much comment about how it don’t make sense for people to spend so much for a machine to watch YouTube and Netflix people are still willing to buy this machine at this amount of price bro didnt want to loose the money on the ipad so he made a video of it and made alot more I know why Because you will ship it to me for free 😜 Me watching him say I don’t need a MacBook if I buy this iPad having just spent 1800 on an M3 MacBook Air with 16GB As a tablet userbrDigital art Need I say more Bor me wat why these npc39s keep buying useless sht like tablets I39m watching this on a samsung😂😂😂 You are a salesman trying to convince people to buy an overpriced tablet shame on you First question I had seeing the new camera array  how about quotspatial videoquot Wasn39t that a quotProquot feature Is this a way to foreshadow they are killing the Vision Pro or are they doing single camera and lidar magic wake me up when it will be able to run photoshop illustrator and premier pro I am watching Apple employees praising their products Hahaha 😂😂😂😂 The top spec IPad is 2599 in the US Even with the highest sales tax in the country at nearly 10 the Ipad will still be less than 2900 Not sure how the one sold in the UK is so much more expensive Can you drop the video now please 👀 The only reason is because he has the money Best 2100 I’ve ever spent IS THIS A SPONSORED VIDEO BY APPLE 😮 I would never spend that kind of money on a tablet with a shitty camera The camera had better be the same as the iphone Nobody is buying this for the camera Because you’re a tech YT channel and if you didn’t your views would drop Weren’t tablets 500 bucks 440 I am also so surprised why does someone need an iPad if they need to use something without touching it Get a Macbook then 😅 Zenless zone zero damn you probbably should have got a surfice but onistly its yout decition brVideo recomendation conpare the ipad to a surfice I do understand the excitement about this tablet and it feels like it is one of those utopia gadgets but It is not going to replace the laptop for me since gaming on pc is the only kind of game play excluding the virtual games I am good at It is gonna be good when it becomes a norm for all of the tablets than we are gonna see it being used by scientist on the field as well I mean they are using them already but can not use it for everything as of now This is just an example though Pure stupidity…Apple Fanboy that eats up anything Apple offers up Because you can As long as the iPad has a good “writing”matte screen protector it’s  pretty sweet to use the Apple Pencil withbr I like to use extra fine nibs as well Just don’t skimp out on them if you drop your pen they will break stay in the 812 dollar price range and they tend to last longer Please say US dollars not dollars There39s a lot of different dollars and that makes you sound wrong in most countries a macbook air with a touch screen no keyboard and ipad os What is bro yapping about sounds to me that you are just making excuses to buy a new unnecessary gadget I mean I would spend that if I had a channel with this size 🤣🤣 37million views  as the time of commenting  I39m sure you39re okay The real reason he spent 3600 is because he can  Isn’t this more powerful than my 2016 MacBook Pro 15 inch I’m just worried about the battery for video editing lol Can I stream games from this I bet it runs Genshin really well But again Battery aspect ratio of screen bothers me the most What should I buy an iPad Pro with the magic keyboard or a Mac Pro or a surface pro What is better for students and better for your money Me with a iPad mini 4 💀 because you wanted and because you can Why You are out of your mind I get that the performance is great and everything but WHY JUST WHY would apple remove an ENTIRE CAMERA Like it makes no sense macbook should really be there for developers and those who benefit from accessing file system command line calculation power also if you need SDport or such otherwise iPad is a decent alternative I use it to study Spanish by reading Nat Geo Espanol It39s much more convenient that reading paper newspapers cause of integrated dictionary AI markup possibilities and internet access Because you have an Awesome tech channel and bags of cash Will you please check out the deminsity 9400  sounds like Darth Vader s hard on lol what39s the game39s name because why not you have the money bro Dude decided to spent 3600 on a product that costs 999 that39s ± R61 000😦 that39s a price of a second hand VW Citi Golf Maybe the damn manufacturers should stop using glue Can someone gift me the 2TB pro version with the pencil and keyboard please 👉🏻👈🏻 coco melon watchers gonna go crazy for this Is there a file manager on this iPad Can you copy your files to a thumb drive if you want Could be a good machine for digital artists but knowing apple it39s probably a trash device restricted so much that it39s unusable for anything other than watching youtube videos the device is only for the rich people like you who want to flaunt the apple logo but sadly that too is futile because Noone is impressed by an apple logo anymorebrA device like this could be the future for digital artists if it would run a full desktop style operating system without restrictions and it would be super powerful so as to do stuff like digital sculpting or 3d painting or vector design etc professionally but the software on a mobile os would be restricted so much that it would be a very expensive toy Also the pencil is perhaps not pressure sensitive either This device seems awesome just not easy on your budget 💰 😳 yapping 100 I find apps on the iPad brain dead compared to apps on the Mac  I do agree Netflix and entertainment apps are great on an iPad Now you are actually a apple representative 😂 justifying 3600 price tag just as 60hz screen on iphone 15 That grey sweater looks cool 👍🏼 Idk how he got to 3600 I maxed everything out and only came to 3046 Which is still absurd I think it’s because he’s from britain This should have a Mac OS option for this with this hardware having a hybrid switch between Mac OS and iPad OS because iPad OS is crap for pro applications and pro work wow that wall garden is really high for this guy so glad i am on linux Bro I could buy a fing car of that money What the hell is a smart toothbrush this is something i wont be buying its not like you can afford it Xplays27363 are u sure LOL i have m2 ipad pro with the overpriced keyboard and pencil 2 just to watch youtube are u sure i cant afford this m4 ipad pro Nah my 15 pen from Amazon is good for me 😂 what is that game hes playing on the ipad i can39t find nuthin bout it anywhere 😐 I love your videos ❤❤ You are now feeling exactly how i felt three years ago when I got the M1 pro and spent 2300 USD hoping it would be a one stop replacement for all my devices unfortunately i still have a desktop laptop WACOM and the IPAD is sitting on a shelf doing nothing Apple needs to unlock the capabilities of the IPAD to run desktop applications  Holding it back so that consumers buy both a MacBook and a IPAD is frustrating Tablets are have bigger screens and are much cheaper than phones broo your son is going to be pround of you 🤣🤣🤣 Pls can you buy me a quest 3 Android user here Saw the add and came to see what39s that about of pure curiosity That price is absolutely crazy Anyways if you watch it back it does sound like a good ad for Apple and at the same time shows you why Apple isn39t giving you a touch screen laptop Honestly your vid gives you all the reasons why rid off Apple And in the end you39ll be connecting it to a bigger screen at home Oh well if you got the 💷 💷 then spend them And next year Apple will come up with their best yet again and some will be checking if they have any body organs left to sell Enjoy What about HDMI screen sharing When the tablet screen costs more than a used car FML 🤦\\u200d♂️ this era 3600 😂 Lmao no one cares just say your broke less battery than previous generation will be a deal breaker for me no one gonna talk abt what he was doing w the toothbrush at the start of the video💀 I still can39t see going from a 34quot monitor or a 32quot and a 27quot to a small screen like that Most people aren39t running around so much to work full time with this Also this is like all stolen from the Surface which is still a PC Granted the screen looks amazing and would be a fine second system to travel with but I couldn39t see doing actual work on it toothbrush was sus aint gonna lie needing extra storage when you have 2 tb goes crazy 😭 😭 me with my 64 gb Because you can Everybody switch from ipad pro to samsung s9 ultra with so much more fonction over the Apple offer with his massive 14 inch screen we are far from phone experience the only thing missing are the apple jailled final cut but everyting else are better on android The s9 ultra 1tb for €1247 GBP with a better pencil expérience included Why is no one talking about the godzilla in the background Battery life and storage are 2 things I39d never wanna compromise on😅😅 my apple pencil has been lost for over 2 years MI only one who noticed his new hair look No one is doing it I want to see this line up testedbrbriPad m4 13 inch 9c binned chipbriPad m4 13 inch 10c full

know how to use that toothbrush 🪥 I just built a PC with a 4070 to super and a 7800x3d CPU Asus gaming motherboard so on it was little over 2000 total for something that not even close in power to my

Gets me why i don’t Own an ipad Got to see these in person thinking about replacing my 2020 macbook pro with this This is a sponsored video 📹 ah yesbrbrone of the most powerful apple product to watch netflix on Apple sucks Dont recommend Actually the pencil from last years iPad Pro has a spot that does the same towards the tip Bigger question is how does one even spend 360000 on an ipad All those things he said at the beginning about tablets being the same as a phone is the whole reason I looked for one that was different than a phone and that means it has to be running a full fat operating system brbrFor those that don39t know a full fat operating system is something like Windows Linux or Mac OSbrbrYes I39m beating around the bush I bought a Surface tablet a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt7561236a woooah that39s one way to say chillin39 with the homies You39re spot on But oft times I need direct phone to phone call which iPad does not do and Samsung Tabs do What was that 3d app It is a no for me that much for for an Ipad I would rather buy a high end gaming pc or gaming laptop😅 Can the you do hardcore programming on the iPad like one can do on a pc Congrats on ur wedding Arun a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt520840a anyone who actually own a gaming pc or console WHEN ARE YOU MAKING AN IPHONE 😢😢😢 I usually like these videos but at the start saying that quotthey have a big redesignquot is kind of a stretch Sure they have a new chip and screen But didn39t most new generations of iPad improve over the previous Yes it39s way better but it39s not like a complete redesigned Do you know what39s better than a slim iPad A waterproof iPad How did they miss the mark on that 😂 after i bought near 576 in tab S8 i thought i39m going to get laptop replacement to do working outside home but now i use it only for tiktok youtube and playing other media stuff in fact in just less then a week ago i bought HP Pavilion Plus 14 for 790 and my productivity going up as exactly as i wanted it got enough battery can still play AAA game better in work stuff 🙁feel like those 576 wasted Ha I don’t have a computer but I do have an iPhone 14 Pro Max This phone is all I need for my online existence Let39s not kid anyone You spent it because you can afford it I hate laptops and only use tablets The sound quality on the M4 is very very poor compared to the 2018 ipad pro Regrettable purchase I think tablets have become more popular in children as parents would limit the age of having a phone which in my opinion has become ridiculously young I am not too sure why it is specifically tablets although I have seen many children under the age of 10 with fullon gaming pcs I don’t see why children can’t just have a tablet to play games on instead of them needing a phone a laptop and a gaming pc Honestly I get that older children in their teens might be ready for another level of gaming with more advanced technology Maybe if someone wanted to borrow a parentguardians’s laptop if they wanted to do something they can’t do on a tablet But some things kids have they really do not need If only it was thicker so it has more protection and batteryit would39ve been perfect You can get mobile app on your macbook btw If you buy the based macbook air with 4gb of ram and with a keyboard for 999 but the ipad also cost 999 but yoy need to pay 400 dollars for a keyboard and another 120 dollars for the pen for that amont of money get your self a macbook with ram upgrades I got 2 ads of 20 sec of moto which is unskipable 💀💀💀 Arun hovering over the buy button and thinking he can get the money for it through a review video So a free ipad technically 😂 IPAD PRO M4 VS GALAXY TAB S9 ULTRA 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 Hey Mr who39s the boss can you do an EDC video Never seen as biased a video from this account before I39m not saying you got paid for this I just think you gave a veryy personal review of how you just love this product instead of giving the rather unbiased and sensible reviews you usually give for any product Bro has literally bought everything in this world😂😂 bro plizz donate me your new iphone 15🙏 imm using old poco x2😭 your poor big fan are you in Vienna Sold your soul bro you don39t deserve respect anymore May you please make a review of the Samsung Galaxy A55 5G Hi Bro How are you brI want to buy these electronic devices how it39s possible  a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt519839a what is bro doing You spent 3500 on the iPad Pro M4 because you could earn over 100000 making a 16 minute video about it Wanted to buy MacBook Air because other laptops feel cheap no 2k tag price later I came on idea like in this video to replace laptop with iPad sounded goodbut then I installed Adobe Acrobat Reader on my iPhone and immediately monthly plan was quotofferedquot after 7 days trial so I deleted the app canceled my decision to buy iPad or MacBook because I don39t want to pay for every fucng thing on it to make it usable Despite having USBC on iPhone I wasn39t able to transfer files to external storage from downloads so I had to find a way to send files on Windows PC despite having iTunes this lead me to decision that my next phone will be again android but still I watched the video  Until iPads run Node js and VS Code they can’t ever ‘replace’ a mac for me I39ve been waiting for iPad full review video and coming to your channel every day to check if you39ve uploaded or not I wonder what39s taking you so long or you are not interested in making a review video this pro is just obliterating the whole point of the ipad air Still not as thin as the Vivo X5 max I remember in one of his videos he showed a website where we can see all the phone camera and the sensors and if we click on those we can go to all the phones which uses the same camera sensor I just remember that the website logo was something blue in colour so if anyone can tell me the website name I would be really grateful ipad is not for games is not forever it has a time period where it is for games after that lag it is 😅😅😅 Tables are the best at media consumption br10 inch oled is all someone needs to watch yt or tv shows from the bed They copy the s24 ultra screensucks apple It39s just a nerfed MacBook Apple is trying to replicate Microsoft Surface with this new iPad the power of PC and tablets all into oneand they are getting closer to cloning it I mean by 2030 iPads have to get the power of an MacBook I brought it i am constantly anxious about it bending Carrying a 4000 dollar worth product in a backpack specially for a college student who takes public transport gets constantly get  banged into things bumping into ppl LIVING LIFE skate boarding re sold it brought Samsung A9 I am sohappy i sometimes use it as a frisbee not kidding i am so happy No point in keeping the tab at home or be constantly worry anxious about when it being in backpack even with cover on Cant believe Arun and me are of same age but living completely different lives i love my life Being a YouTuber is exhausting imagine being in a constant state of carrying this or it getting stolen You should keep it in a bank Laptops are more durable even macs for that matter Good luck i hope it works well for you Can you gift a cheapest ipad air I have a dream to illustrate there through procreate 🥹 Not a smart tooth brush lol Imagine spending 💲3600 on a tablet only to watch Netflix Can💎 Honor magic 6 could be the new android king👑 🥶 This feels like a sponsored video You are so beautiful 😘🇺🇸 But do you want to work on a 13” tablet I can see the XDR through the screen Ever heard of UTM If you don’t need your laptop send it my way I’ll give it a good home 😂 the backround looks soooooooo fakebrnot a hater shits too expensive these days quotI feel like i39m not holding an Oversized phonequotbrTake a look at the iPad Mini 6 Been using the galaxy tab s8 for about 2yrs now and absolutely love it Had no need to buy a laptop as it does what i want it to do Usec to love laptops But those days are long gone Havi g the same chipset tha5 my s23 ultra has isnt a downside Our mobile chips are stupid powerful that smartphones dont really make the best use case Th3 only fail point is gaming Well that is if you want to play console like games But other than that i never felt the need for a more powerful cpubrbrMy pc is where i will be productive enough that i actually need power I have a 7950x3d 3080 12gb 32gb 6000 cl32 ram And a bunch of storage I dont need my tablet to do what my pc does I just need my tablet to do what my phone does but better Remote playing ps5 using youtube Browsing web etc And cause i own a s23 ultra and a tab s8 i can use wireless samsung dex So i can have access to the internet and use my tablet Is it a perfect experience No but it is a usable one And i dont pay anything extrabrbrBut by and large the number 1 thing i do on my tablet is read Novels manga light novels web novels etc The screen size is fantastic My tablet allows me to do 80 of what i did with my laptop Its smallernthan a laptop thinner than a laptop Better battery life than a laptop Easier to travel around with over a laptop And what it fails at doing my pc does and does it much better than any laptop or tablet could ever hope for it to dobrbrHell cause i own my tablet i have never felt the need for a dual monitor My 55quot 4k 120hz vrr qled is all i ever felt like i needed cause i can use my tablet to do s3cond screen function without being a second screen Or i can even use it as a second screen for my pc Except have it wireless So i can lay down in my bed and use my wireless keyboard and mouse and just lay down and use it that way brbrTablets are fantastic And heres the thing that 3600 tablet will perform very similarly in daily life that my 1000 tablet can do The niche edge case of using the video editing on the go isnt worth 2000 And it wont perform as good as a computer

huawei products anymore it39s been a while since you last spoke about huawei Even with the section from the united state we still want to know about it I still use my old iPad GEN six for drawing I have a question why does Samsung insist on making fun of Apple and then does the same thing  For example when Apple took the phone adapter out of the box they mocked Apple like clowns then they did it themselves or Apple introduced a titanium phone  Then Samsung came and copied Apple Do a experia 1 mark 6 review and give your feedback please yeah your play head video isn39t sponsored why put it I could buy a Apple Vision Pro for almost that price quotmummy my skibidi toilet is bentquot The dude just spent the entire video trying hard to convince himself why he NEEDS the new iPad Pro over the

with my 256GB M1 Ipad pro I don39t need to upgrade since I mostly use my Ipad to watch TikTok for bigger picture than my phone 😂 I have the 11” M2 cellular iPad Pro and it’s definitely a ‘freeing’ sort of device You can pop it open ANYWHERE on the bus in the middle of a field work on something with cellular close it and go No wifi to worry about and phone OSes are apps are built to be interrupted The small size also makes it super easy to use on the go I personally think 11” is the sweet spot and my MacBook is now getting a lot less usage I wish I had the new one it would be so useful with that amazing calculator man I’m doing Geometry over the summer right now and get algebra 2 my next school year that new IOS 18 ipad calculator would be so useeful Apple is a joke they

MrWhoIsTheBoss This man isx4 the most successful utube guy you will ever meet Can you code Net applications on that iPad Is it just me or does anyone else want him to buy all the razer blade laptops Hate apple all you want Their tech are engineering marvels Enjoyable video One thing though I genuinely prefer to use a company’s website than their apps Time and again I discover that the app is a dumbed down version of their website and I eventually have to ditch the app to use their website to get full functionality One example is MailChimp There are features that just aren’t available through the app and so I log into their website via the iPad’s browser Most of the time a website has functions that a company’s app simply does not Let me correct you I don39t know where you get that

this much in the first place You haven’t gotten to the dad jokes yet As someone who works in app and web dev industry I for one hate downloading apps for everything Web is overall just better and will usually not hoard resources of your device as long as you have good hygiene whereas apps can get access to all sorts of weird local hardware level access and I don’t trust that with every rando app out there I just spec39d out an iPad here in the states and it39s only 2599 fully spec39d you guys are getting ripped of in the UK lol Poor Europeans getting ripped off The official Apple site says 999 My bad 2000 Thanks for insight I had 2 year ago I buy Ipad pro 12inc and you comments convince me that I need to get this also  Just ordered it Thank you for the great work you do Apple just make a detachable laptop  🙄 I39m kind of the same I have an iPhone an Apple Watch and recently got the MacBook Air 13quot M2 what I am using I don39t see a need for an iPad if I have a MacBook if I were to buy any new Apple Product it would be a new phone since the 11 only has 64GB and that39s why this has 512GB The girls at my college do NOT useneed 3600 worth of ipad😭😭 Unfortunately this new 3600 iPad does not survive the toddler bend test I am confused The new iPad Pro 13 inch is listed at 1299 in the US not 3600 RECENTLY YOU HAVE A BIG FOCUS ON APPLE PRODUCTS br🙃 One day it will be a Macbook You pick Gaming of a beast PC or silly little screen that made of metal My ipad prod 2018 have been very useful as a mobile gaming device and still overpowered in today39s normal games I checked the apple website it’s says it’s only 1000 id rather buy an M4 rifle for 2599 than an ipad for 3500 Bend it ist like you are talking about the first time seeing an ipad with an keyboard… it dies the same things the los ones with keyboard did nothing new ist the same restricted OS with terrible file system even call it like that a keyboard that’s probably the worse software keyboard out there brbrit’s quite good in some things but if you really want to work with it let me tell you from years of letdowns by the software you will not be able to brbriPad OS is the worst software implementation for a tablet out there right now what makes it good are apps like procreate not the software apple put on there themselves and samsungs tablets got a huge leap in productivity with there real window management brbrif apple doesn’t announce any change at WWDC I probably sell my ipad which is then my last apple device too long time they call it a laptop replacement but it’s not really that for someone who really works digitally too many restrictions and tons of bugs AndroidSamsunggoogle or apple and in 4 months that iPad will collect dust and be used once a week to watch a YouTube video the couch like all the other iPads I love having an android phone and an iPad cause iPhones don’t seem worth it at all but I love the iPad And still having an android gives me the best of both worlds I litreally watching this on the ipad m4 pro Old Is gold ❤brBut it39s good reviews 😅 Hey I saw you in Nottingham city centre a few months ago but didn’t have the time to say hi Just wanted to let you know I loved the vids Look at the remixes on this video 💀 The biggest problem of the ipad is that it is still an IPAD lol No matter how great the screen gets you will still do the same thing as an ipad air or the regular ipad 80 of the time I have an Ipad air and Im glad I didn39t buy the Ipad pro For what I do with it basically does the job The saddest thing is that Apple does know what their doing if they put a touch screen on a mac its the end for the ipad the most expensive you can make your iPad is 3077 use by the way Are you smoking grass 🤣 i know whyfor the views views turn to  I completely disagree with the main point in this video The reason I don39t like tablets is BECAUSE of the apps Why do I need to have something permanently installed on my device for practically every single function and use case when I can just do it one time in my browser and they close it This really is End Game Tablet lt3 Hello Arun Luv your videos Is it a review or Justifying your 3600 Who pays that kind of money for a tablet Because you have money and to review the product to gain views to earn more money than product Just simple How much money you got from Tim Apple for this one you spend 3600 because you can is it worth the money NOPE you just gotta tell all the apple fanboys that it is though useless Mate you are a ipad person as you are a tech guy Lets not get confused looks like apple had thrown a lot of cash on Mrwhosetheboss AVP 👽 brYou 🙉 heard why  and they both lost quothuman trafficking   cool causequotDarrell stabs I39m tracking  Well they are tracking down quotgroups  in

lot of policequot that i know honey 🍯 do39s no it39s not   In general I feel what is the point of making macbooks if ipads are gonna have keyboards and do almost everything a macbook can do Now dont quote me on that because im pretty sure there are still functions a macbook has that a ipad is absent on But then again i can be wrong Over all i feel ipads will take over MacBooks in terms of ipads having keyboards pencils and a wireless mouse and if possible a wired mouse and to include also the fact that the ipads and macbooks use almost or probably completely the same processor Lastly to include the prices are crazy for a ipad that costs 3600 dollars at that point its not worth it by the prices probably you might as well stick with the ipads that have the m2 chips which almost literally does the same thing that the m4 model ones do 3grand for table is nutsbuy mackbook instead D Bro please buy me a new Nintendo switch 🥺🥺😌 Ohh  Pubg mobile I need a sponsor 🙌 Just buy the £999

twisted your enshitification video applies to the whole mobile app ecosystem not just the platforms you specifically mentioned ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ They made the iPad better than the MacBook so you can replace it with the iPad and the next MacBook will be so much better than this iPad that you39ll want to switch back to MacBook And so on Sustainability is key right Three grand though really 🤔 In the laptop segment they had a competition so they extended the battery life while in tablet segment they are way ahead of the competitors so they didn39t bump the battery If m4 uses half the power unlike M2 then why not to leave the battery what was there already And that39s the Apple thing Making Pro lighter than Air series is totally contradicting the initial concept of bringing quotairquot in the market It seems that apple is doing something to cover up or has a massive new plans to get new ppl on the PRO And I contributed to that £2 877 iPad price with 6 ads for a mere 16 minutes video🚮 “Because any video I make about it will more than pay for the 3000 iPad” Slide over and tiling doesn39t work that effectively on iOS Consequently you are better off with two screens whether it be having two iPad Pros or an iPad Pro and an iMac It makes sense for both to have stands and Magic Keyboards and Mice and at least one to have an Apple Pencil The extra screen real estate and full screen multitasking beats the performance win of these new tablets If you want to edit a movie you need a 5K iMac at the very least if not a Mac Pro From the looks of things reMarkable works well out of the house away from your desktop due to its long battery life and clear focused UX Also try to unplug some of the time whilst you are out and look at some trees Why Because your a multi millioner dude 13 inch i like you shirt What is that Because MrWhoseTheBoss is an Apple super fan or being rewarded by Apple and thus there will never be a price point which he would say things are getting ridiculous Can I get a wedding invite everything is excellent but one thing is missing ie AI features todays era technology is all about AI apple must TAKE concern on AI 3600 for a tablet

So much power m4 chip for an enlarged iphone is stupidity Also the point of buying an ipad dies where the price point reaches A person being able to pay nearly 4000 dollars for an ipad with the accessories would not use the ipad’s power and rather have an macbookwindows or even better an employee at his studio for the work And that pencil innovation stupidest ever Literally they can get better ideas from surveys rather than their research team An eraser on the behind sensor scrolling using pencil camera shutter on touch of apple pencil multiple kind of pencil tips Thats what would be innovation innovation which would be worth for an upgrade none of that major upgrade is in the price People with crazy money are only the customers they gonna have any rationale person would not upgrade to this from 2018 or later model because this is crap and very minor upgrade lighter weight doesnt matter thinner ipad doesnt matter nor does those display numbers A simple question  what

an iPad with keyboard and pencil is the logical choice for a single device As much as I love the Samsung ecosystem apple do know how to make a tablet and they do better than Samsung because of the M

someone that works in the cinema industry iPads are actually godly useful for me Fullon computer LOL D With an OS like this It39s a joke not a computer I just bought my m2 iPad Pro… I though you already use iPhone and why do you need 8 tb I only have 512 gb The one thing that I really don39t like with apps is it being in this ward off garden that Apple control Like the openness of the web that anyone can create a website and it doesn39t have to be approved by anyone When it works it39s great but when Apple want to not allow a particular app on The platform then it is blocked With a light laptop vs a tablet I think you get a better experience with only a little bit added weight 4000 for a tablet is insane Aren39t you the guy from sensodyne ad So many ads 😞 Sooooo basically you spent the last 16 minutes convincing yourself that your really need it quotBecause I didn39t work a day in my life to earn moneyquot Well I think these are brilliant and very informative comments\\xa0brThe answers to my questions I was going to ask Apple today have now been answered  I have a 13inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar an iPad Pro 105inch and a Remarkable 2 for just taking notes  which I have not really used and was going to buy the Mac mini so I could connect this up to my TV so I could use the Mac mini on tv like an iMac computer  brBut am now thinking sell all these and buy the M4 13inch iPad and the keyboard and pencil with it  Then connect this up to my tv and get it to work as an iMac computer when I need it like that  I think the best of all worlds what do you thinkbrI am in my 7039s used to teach computers and now starting a small business selling greeting cards wall art book marks etc for digital and physical selling  So I use a lot of clipart and photos quotes and sayings and also use for writing little stories and having documents saved etcbrWould this work do you think  🤔 Because you’re a millionaire Good infomercial mate I’ll stick to my laptop His Apple bias is showing😂 Nice add Unsubscribe Looks like the iPad is going to compete the laptop market too brFor the multiuser specific experience use it as a laptop or as an iPad device Since you have money but don39t know where to spend it I just found out after years of not using the iPad Files that the file handling nowadays is actually pretty good and robust on iOS I can get shit done as quickly and easily as on mac it just took like 15 seconds of adjusting ❤🇮🇶Hello suggest me the best channels for reviewing phones Thank you I am from Iraq Well said I nees to see Those who want Arun39s quotwhat39s in my phonequot video 🙄 He spent 3600 on the iPad because it39s going to make him 10x that with this vid😂 If you know how to use it and utilise the power And you can afford it Best if you can buy it via your business and make money from itbrbrI spent that much on an ebike and that is worth it for me I’ve reached the point I am just saying fuck it apple Keep it as an iPhone file management since you refuse to make it more mac like but at least update the files app It’s atrocious at this point brbrThis is coming from a brand loyal Apple customer Was great to briefly see you… 😅 but yeah… the points you made at 15 minutes as someone that’s always been excited about an iPad eventually replacing my Mac I don’t think this iPad Pro will simply because there’s no ‘pro’ currently in iPadOS unfortunately Dunno solid hardware but it’s still just an iPad As a software developer and a structural engineer this iPads serves little to no purpose for me lol Netflix and chill 😎 W8 are you saying that besides the sales number in notebooks are downing now Apple created a competitor for their own bad seller new amazing notebook  Sorry but that for me is sht same tablets  every year same phones old innovations 💡 why apple still alive M1 iPad Pro user here I had the same thought processes as you when iPad came out Hell i even got cellular on my and spect it out to Mac level price but man was I wrong You will start using it as a “dummer” laptop but man sometimes you will go back to your Mac and ask your self why the fuck was i using my iPad Lol Downloading video feature Cellular connection lolbrEtc etc silly features he mentioned just to justify 3600 on a device which will be mostly used for content watching 😂😂brbrFor apple fans  True Value for money go get it😅 I am surprised that the new Apple Pencil Pro and the keyboard are not priced at 169 369 and 429 given that they have a lot of improvements Wait you guys across the atlantic can get small cars for 3600 I think your quest from moving from this MacBook that makes me drool to an  iPad which however sophisticated is just an iPad My life evolves around my MacBook I have an iPad Mini 5 that I bought for  250 because I wanted to use an Apple Pencil for annotating stuff further a toy on the side to read ebooks and watch downloaded movies Maybe we are moving to a world in which everybody only has an iPad mini with a M10 processor that one connects to a 30quot screen when entering the house Yikes A451800 for ipad pro 13inch 2tb pencil pro keyboard 🤯🔥 For this price it needs to replace my laptopdesktop The iPad mini 4 is also just 53 mm Me watching this video on a iPad Pro My wife only uses her iPad so the upgrade makes sense for her Day 5 and 6 of asking Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop How did you make this video without addressing the elephant in the room  that iPadOS is a mediocre desktop OS at best Have you used one with a keyboardtrackpad and monitor It doesn’t feel like a Mac it feels like a device that is fighting you at every turn I can already say you will use it for 23 days max hahahaha that’s it Overpowered device lacking a OS worthy of it brbrApple loves you spent all that money for no real reason iPad the way it handles files is just ridiculous you just can’t work like this no matter what saving files and then opening them again it’s a disaster sometimes I try to make something in some apps then wanted to make some special things on the iPad but forget it it just doesn’t work You very excited almost sounds like me 2 years ago took me 12 days

new product comes out from Apple you start to think that you are already a flawed person because your iPad or phone is already outdated and you need to urgently run to the store and buy a new one🤦\\u200d♂ Nokia users 💀 br just jokes I don’t use my laptop at all I use it for a math class which they say I need in order to use it It’s for this program that makes you take an exam and

change… You’re not a terribly bright guy… For 400 more you could’ve bought the M2 ultra computer… Which is 1000 times better than any iPad You bought it because you wanted it and because you depend on such purchases to boost your channel and have 186M Subscribers making you rich Not that complicated If you spent 3600 on an iPad you need to have your head checked and I say it again 3600 for me to watch YouTube while I39m taking a sht I give no respect for this thing I had the First ever iPad back when I was 9 used it for years but when I grew I felt I need something REAL so I bought a Mac than

Occasionally I’ll plug into a PC at home but it’s mostly for film photo editing I haven’t quite found something on the iPad as good as negative lab pro in Lightroom You39re losing a sub if you don39t pin this comment Nobody needs this Until it can dualboot or virtualize MacOS no more of my quotpad moneyquot for Apple Do you have an older iPad Air like 4 or something to donate me please Thank you Because you39re wealthy and a YouTuber and you need the best technology to create content Enough said Yes these ipads seems pretty good most powerful than 80 of the Pc39s sold in the market and all  but even if i am an Apple fan  i39m strarting to think that Apple needs to Change Ipad OS totally Why not let us dual boot with Mac OS sonoma  why can39t i play Motorstorm Pacific Rift  A PS3 emulated game who is running perfectly fine on my M3 Macbook   Apple needs to open their OS and let people do what they want  This will drasticaly boost their sales i39m sure of that to make that video I am stil waiting for the Ipad OS keynote to know if i should  buy or not Dude if you39re sending stuff to your phone because you can39t do it on your computer you39re using the wrong platform  Also what about heat dissipation when doing serious crunching and other tasks on the move Most immature video ever  a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6101010a acually apps have waaaay more rights on your device than webversion That means app can steal your dataspy on you etc and they actually doing it Web version of an application can not do it since it limited by web browser permission it can not turn on your camera if browser do not have that permission or need approvement from you Nowdays one of main ways to earn money and improve your business is information private information as you understand  where you walkingeatinghow much  you ready to pay for services and thousands of other cases So almost all service providers going from webversions to app versions due to reasons mentioned in 1st2nd sentences br   To be completely honest that not the only reason Security of service control over service options  all these things are much easier to realize in your app than in other gentelman39s web browser But personally for me its unacceptable being a quotproductquot and i39m trying to separate my life from being used to fulfil someone39s statistics especially when we see that companies taking this information do not pay you for it and do not have limits how deep they getting into your private life  which is clear stealing for me br   I39ve seen many adepts of quoti have nothing to hidequot propaganda and thats i lie or clear luck of knowledge Would you be glad to see how fast food sales grows copying your emotions from first kiss or your child born moment And thats just small harmless example How about pressing you to pay more and more for services subscriptions as example exploiting your personal weaknesses to certain colourssoundscombinations of pictures Still quothave nothing to hidequot And thats not a quotfuture technologiesquot for many years already Someone can call it paranoic  yes it is no it was paranoic 20 years ago maby Not now I personally never saw the importance of an tablet… I’m a tech IT engineer but tablets Not useful at allbrLaptop  Phone and it’s done 💯 Ngl this video specifically very satisfying and calming Dunno if it was the music

with a surface Pro 3 with the surface Dock I studied film and made all the edits on that Also I made Illustrations in Photoshop and animated them in After effects all on that thing now i own a surface

better desktop and multi monitor support than those stupid ipadsbrNever understood why anybody would limit themself with an ipad Bro Mrwhostheboss pls review the honor magic 6 pro dont lie to your self you will never be able to do the work you do on a Mac on an Ipad Youll always need a full blown computer Apple will never allow Ipads to undermine ther Macbooks even the advertisment said it was

it I39m on a M1 version and won39t upgrade until the thing breaks as it serves no additional function I am thinking of choosing ipad pro or ipad air for stock screening and daily note taking Not owning an iPad and laptop before so want to own an iPad like a laptop which one should I choosebr120Hz seems make no difference The IPad Pro best competition is a surface pro which at around the same price can do more than an IPad Ipad OS could have a high tier with more use cases better than the standard one like for digital creators and dev applications brThe surface Pro can do those things and so IPads are only a choice for people in the Apple Garden Wall You can already press the older pencil… The problem I have with the iPad keyboard case and Pencil is it’s trying to be a laptop computer when it’s not a laptop computer brWhy is it not a laptop computer I hear you say well it’s because of iOS brThat’s the iPads achilles heal… it’s not that it doesn’t have the power far from it it’s

the new Apple iPad lineup The 11quot Air is not a replacement for the much more usable Mini form factor If they39re killing the Mini line of iPads I39m done with Apple for good They39ve watered down their ecosystem of phones and tablets and are consistently going in the iwrongi direction with product features Ive already switched to  ipad pro from my pcs The real reason he spent 3600 on the ipad is because he wanted to make this video 100 lol He’s already made over 10k from ads from this video Facts Begging for clicks Not matter where you go on Youtube Everybody begging for clicks I hate itbrHe is even very smartly cross referencing to other products trying to push his clicks even morebrThis guy is nothing but a big billboard for companies just like most Youtubers \\u200bsmallego8068and there39s nothing wrong with that He started young at a time of a young YouTube And he had the advantage of starting a channel of very few at the time He39s grown big Congrats to him If you could do the same as far making money you probably would too It39s his job And he39s fortunate to have started his channel when he did because it39s very hard for new tech channels to come to an uprise since there are now to many known super channels smallego8068if that was the case then he wouldn’t have released a video right after this one where he spends half the video talking about the problems he’s had using the iPad Pro all the improvements and why he’s not making it his primary device If he really was just a “billboard” for Apple that video would almost be a career suicide \\u200bpratyakshgupta8451 You are way too naive for this world if you really mean what you saidbrIn the video you mentioned he talked about how great the Ipad Pro is for the first minutes He also smartly used those minutes to promote SIM cards as well\\rbrWhen he finally started with the criticism he used the criticism to actually promote a totally different product a Logitech mouse But a few seconds later one just realizes that the criticism wasn39t a real criticism at all Because which Apple user cares about Logitech products working with the Ipad pro Right no one And then he immediately turned the attention to a Apple product that works perfectly fine the Magic mouse The criticism was actually a promotion for a Apple productbrThe remaining quotcriticismquot is a joke Just minor things He himself called them minor issues Those will nobody keep from buying the Ipad Pro because the Ipad Pro has no competition This is by the way a very typical behaviour with these quotreviewersquot when they quotcriticizequot something The will always put their ciriticism into perspective and weaken them by saying things like I can life with that etc Or as he said a few seconds later quotWill I return it No I still love itquotbrIn the end Apple doesn39t care Apple probably does even appreciate the feedbackbrAnd in the end another promotion Surfshark smallego8068 He in fact actually reviewing products as they are he actually doesnt even like apple products that much so now i assume you think Apple is paying him to advertise the ipad He gives honest reviews of products rather than just praise something for quotclicksquot as you say I have watched his vids since he first started doing this and I think the total opposite of what you do MartinMurray1966 I don39t think any Youtuber is paid directly by a big company The most they do is sending them products for free to quottestquot them If they were paid directly by the company the video must be marked as paid promotion as far as I knowbrThe title itself is click bait with the only purpose of drawing as much clicks as possible He exactly knows that it will draw both Apple users and nonApple users Most of the money comes from from the ads that are shown before and during the video i was just wondering are you from Kerala  Can you review the itel p55 5g Its a 73 phone with a dimensity 6080 I am happy using a Chromebook with 8GB of ram that will updated into the 203039s for a tenth of the amount of this apple thingy I think Apple are just overpriced and mostly nothing special With money saved I can buy a proper camera like a Pentax K1 meanwhile me getting roasted without getting roasted with my ipad 8 Why don’t you giveaway…I suppose that was totally unnecessary now Defnitely not fo iPad kiddo39s Apple stole ad from LG and ban all users that said it What a dishonest shit company Nice product boring and hackneyed presentation😢 I paid less for my car over 1200 less I too was very excited to get my M2 129quot iPad Pro A year and a half later I still use my laptop for everything and use the 1200 ipad for watching netflix on the sofa It39s such a great device but useless for me when I can just use my computer or a phone the problem I have is laptop screens arent as good as this ipad is suppose to be they dont make laptops with good displays or they cost more than 2000 Soooo true exactly same here I’m designer bough iPad on release of m1 though would be a great addition to my work making things on computer then going to iPad to draw somethings over it but men it always turns into disaster saving files and working then it just doesn’t work so many times I try it and always lost so much time for nothing now it’s just a website responsive tester for me and sometimes watch some YouTube everything else on my Mac and iPhone thousand times faster iPad is just a fifth wheel in the work process I spend 1500 euros on that still feel ashamed about it I only can imagine using it if they base iPad os on Mac OS it’s the only way so we have a real desktop space and can have many windows one over another and can adjust them like we want and save  files everywhere like on a mac then yess it will be very great decide if not it’s just a gimmick You cannot be a power user and do that I swapped to an IPad Pro when my laptop died and it’s working but I’m mostly writing with the occasional spreadsheet For my uses it’s overpowered Even then the laptop it replaced a 500 craptop from Best Buy and I spent 1200 replacing it with this thing and the Magic Keyboard so still not good bang for the buck considering I could get a MacBook Air for less \\u200bepbrown01Can you gift me a cheapest ipad air I have a dream to illustrate there through procreate 🥹 markm7411 yes similar experience here I got gaming laptop and it was heavy and the battery is so bad so about half year ago I decided to buy Samsung tab S8 thought it would be great to do my work in excel when I39m not at home with wayyy better battery than my gaming laptop turns out it is full kinds of limitations anywhere every time I try to do something quotsimplequot then last week I bought HP Pavilion Plus 14 laptop and I got exactly of what I really need good battery and maintain the performance to do the work outside and easy to carry anywhere and the tablet now just for media consumptions and to shows quick presentation to my colleague epbrown01 so  why the iPad and not the MacBook Air magnesiafrost1863 Consolidation Rather than own a separate tablet and a MacBook Air I wanted a single device for content consumption and light computing I went with an iPad after measuring my usage and finding I lean much more to consumption than creation well over half the time The closest alternative would be a convertible laptop but I found those awkward in terms of size and weight I bought like 10 years ago an ipad and only watched Netflix and did basic stuff I bought an ipad pro 11 as a replacement for my MacBook It was fine for 2 weeks and then I stop using it as a laptop and only an ipad Now I only watched Disney and Netflix that39s it I use mine for school and while it has made school life A LOT easier I don’t really use my iPad outside of just note taking and YTNetflix Im the opposite i use my m1 ipad a lot more than my macbook even though im a student magnesiafrost1863to use in bed lol or chilling more portable and if you work on laptopimac all day you just want to sit something in your hand and use your hands I like many others have tried so hard to replace my laptop with an iPad but it cant and will never work due to the restrictions of iPad OS The list is endless and I don’t believe any serious power user can Some things Excel doesn’t work with formulas there is no preview function for a file like on a mac you need to open everything to see what’s in it the internet browser is a mobile version which means websites don’t work the same and extensions are not there like on the desktop browser Video editing works but there are allot of features missing in the iPad OS versions Stagemanager for multitasking in laughable and the file explorer is horrendous etc etc etc It will only work when OSX runs on the iPad which it should since M1 I think in a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt7521232a the man in the background is Marques mkbhd or i could get a 4090 pc plus my dream sim racing setup bruh i could buy a Miata for that kind of money and have way more fun Exactly I bought my daily driver 93 saturn sc2 manual for 1200 less The Microsoft Surface Pro 9 with its shortcomings is still a better tablet device It39s a fullon computer My children end up being the actual owners of my iPad Awesome vid as always❤ To meit just seems  worse than my £700 laptop lol S10 ULTRA GOING NEG gtgtgt Why don39t you do a head to head of the new iPad Pro and the Samsung S9 Ultra You might not need to give up your Samsung Phone Having said that we all know you are an Apple fanboy You said a bunch of nothing… This guy saying i spent  3600  while showing Apple store ipad video With MacOs I39d may consider one Only good for those who are earning 3600 from youtube So you had to buy a keyboardcase you make it useful OLED is a downgrade I39ll buy one when they get rid of it MiniLED is superior Hey Arun you should get your 2022 outro back on videos cause it was so nice a music Hello arun I love you content very much brbrI want to ask you for a favour though pls dash me your old cameras or any other of your old Samsung phones with good camera do that I can use

of paper folds like a piece of paperquot Finally an Oled display The 13 inch is skinnier than the 11 inch because the 13 inch has more room to stretch out cpus and batterys Bro it’s 3 am and I’m watching this on a iPad 😂 hey I was wondering what you do with the phones you review I really hate asking for free things but my daughters sweet 16 in in 1 week and right now I39m not finacalliy able to buy her one after my wife died I39ve been working 3 jobs just to pay the bills and if it would be possible to give me one a samsung or apple would work best but if you cant that39s ok but if you could it would make her year and my year Hi I followed your recommendation to join the VPN Shark used the VPN then decided to install the Security product and then I cannot access the internet no

guy who complained about paying 700 USD to the AI pin now says paying the price more than 5 times as high as the device make sense and being excited what a waste of money great for my white female friends ipad should really  just run mac He really sucked that smart toothbrush Buy ipad I am get galaxy tabbr A8 I guess if you39re into the Apple ecosystem you might be moved Listening to you felt like deja vu inside my head about my 2year old 14quot 56mm Galaxy Tab 8 Ultra Replaced both my laptop and my reMarkable 2 OLED masterpiece Correctly positioned camera Executes Windows via DeX like a champ Phone chip or not it edits video flawlessly  You39ve got to hand it to Apple for 39inventing39 yearsold stuff Oh BTW about 50 of the highend iPrice I’m not hearing you out video skippedbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrjk lol Ok I39m an apple user but instead of getting ipad i got samsung galaxy tab s9 ultra because samsung dex is something which is most advanced as per ipad os and it let us beyond where we can use tablet as an laptop I also have an macbook but when i need to take for lighter use i can go with my tab I don39t know about you people but as per my perspective ipad is just waste of money I support this product It‘s not for everyone The iPad pro is for designers and people who really need to work with a tablet which I am not If you just want a tablet to watch Netflix you can always buy an iPad air bb I want 16” iPad with 4TB bb You got conned The M1 macbook air is sufficient for most cases Sponsor ReMarkable Its another useless product just like smart watches to distract you from your real life Arun you sound like you39re trying to justify the purchase to yourself C39mon man 3600 for a tablet My opinion is you39re losing touch with reality 3600 You39re essentially saying you39ll literally pay ANYTHING for a tiny bit more convienence oh and btw your quotmassive heavy laptopquot isn39t really is it love you man but this video got me triggered Easy dude He could easily make back 3600 and more by releasing a video on it WahPiang that’s not the point he’s making Because he makes a ton of money from YT so he will buy every useless sheet nomatter how expensive it is i perso bought the Honor magic6pro because it39s cheaper than iPhone 16 pro or Galaxy 25 ultra and can do what their rivals can39t like air gestures and 3D face unlock How is this losing touch with reality You’re only getting salty because you can’t afford it And why are you triggered at a tech channel buying the latest tech It’s literally his job brbrIt’s also his money Stop being triggered of other people’s purchases It’s ridiculous 0hkie can’t I Ok 0hkiedid you watch the video His angle for the video is justifying why 3600 for an iPad is in fact good value Oh which amounted to it’s a bit more convenient to carry Are you forgetting apple as a corporation pitch their products to maximise revenue Charging the maximum they think consumers will accept to pay Well I say 3600 for an iPad is far too expensive and I’m triggered because Arun as a respected tech reviewer seems to believe this is quite acceptable  it isn’t MrHappyjollyit’s quite of an expensive tablet indeed but maybe for him it is justified to pay that price instead of new MacBook … he is doing review and also can have his own opinion that’s all ❤ DominikZagar yep and I’m offering an alternate opinion and i’m saying 3600 for a tablet is just racketeering This video is trying to justify it and I don’t think he did a good job which is impossible because 3600 is not justifiable Watch his follow up video it doesn’t work The ridiculous way how apple pencil place to the iPad always make me chuckle Can it run OBS for streamersyoutubers  DONE MESS WITH SAMSUNG BOI I don’t think this is it even as a avid Apple user this is just not it What a cool way to sleep on the street 😂 The bank after this videobrAHHHHHHH IM TURNING INTO PALM NIIIII AGHHHHWHSHSH😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱➖ Yes My only concern is when you expect this to work as your macbook M4 will be soaked in heat way more quickly than in macbook air In other words they position the M4 iPad Pro as a macbook pro seller Yes there will be overheat and clock throttling problems down the line of this Fake news you didn’t spend 3600 cause you didn’t buy it yet Where is your M4 iPad you were talking bout Stop lying and scamming apple fanboy Yea but a pit pointless i will forever put a protective  tempered  glass and case on any device i have especially  if it is that thin one drop and it39s done 36k lost Im clumsy so i need it but for those who are not clumsy at all lucky a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt568928a  blackout 😅 We39re still waiting on software Hardware is on point but until we get closer to something like DeX its not ready Its a common complaint for years now I suppose the idea of the iPad actually being useful is spreading throughout the whole user base over the span of the design iteration I happen to be in the high expectations high disappointment camp My main issue is always old pc habits i dont know why they keep making it thinner especially when everybody is just going to slap a huge case on it because the damn thing snaps in half like a twig A person having S23 ultra doesn39t need this it39s big enough to fulfill all the needs and also has it39s stylus builtin to the body 😂😂 I mean if someone wants to develop apple apps you probably can39t access Desktop apps on a Ipad like Xcode and You wouldn39t be able to run Virtual machine like Windows on Linux operating systems A Laptop would be better since you can change the operating system and have more storage I don39t think Ipad is good for desktop applications whether on Macos or windows What a waste Bro just get a smaller laptop why do you have the biggest heaviest laptop Apple make that39s just ridiculous Putting an M4 in an iPad is like putting an RTX 4090 in a fridge 😂 Man spends 3600 uses the device once then keeps it in a drawer for 5 years before throwing it away 😂 Apple is too proud to copy the surface kick stand Such an obvious addition to any tablet This is such a cope iPad failed Let39s just be honest about it now Your problem is that you have a ridiculously large laptop get a 10quot GPD Winmax 2 2023 super powerful tiny yet it39s a real very portable computer You can get a Galaxy Tab S6 Lite for 10 the cost and it comes with a pen 😂 can you run Windows on the Ipad or a Virtual machine on the Ipad I want to run Windows Desktop Applications and use virtual machine It makes sense those Netflix videos require a super computer 😂🤡 Do the bend test with apple care just in case Can you pick me one up to fully loaded with all the accessories What was bro doing with that toothbrush Why did he spend that much Because he39s rich has sponsors and it39s fully tax deductible for him MK did say it best Its still a Ipad no matter whats under the hood You boot it up and you have Ipad OS I have a M2 129 and Newest Pencil before the Pro was announced So Im good for a replacement for a couple generations Word of advise if you can afford the Ipad he just bought Get the macbook pro M3 with all the bells and whistles Nobody uses MacBook unless your a youtuber richdollars8337 This is true But just from these 2 products You’ll get more bang for your buck getting a MBpro It may be a Mac but it’s still a computer as opposed to a tablet pretending to be That’s all I meant richdollars8337 Around half the people in my university cohort use a MacBook including me This is also the case for most of the universities in the UK Yeah I hate when people say this the same argument can be said about the MacBooks they are useless because you can’t play any of the good games and your spending the same price What do you really need from the MacBook that can’t be done with a iPad if you’re not an editor or YouTuber What is the name of the game the case will have to be heavier than the ipad stuck to it or it will topple backward Doesn39t the macs with m chips support just iPad OS apps If you have something like a computer you don’t need a new iPod maybe they upgrade Ipad os more closely to MacOs or maybe making it even same to it so they can Preform just like a macbook if so that would be amazing since M4 used on it Exact reason apple will not introduce macbook with touch screen because they want you to spend more money on an ipad for the convenience of removing the keyboard something youtuber tech reviewers will not call out apple for No hate to mrwhosetheboss butbrSomeone who has just enough budget for macbook shouldn’t have to spend 3k more for an ipad maybe I wrong but just an opinion a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt437717a What game is that I get you bro this is worth it cause athough it is a mobile device but can also do all the tasks a macbook does without any hick as well That what i need going to start saving money to buy it It39s the ton part of the 2024 Macbook with a touchscreen It looks Apple will continue to limit powerful M4 iPad Pro with the SW which is a bummer iPad at least Pro needs to seriously open its capabilities and approach Mac like experience Apple is loosing another great chance to grow its user base with these completely ridiculous and stupid limitations Waiting for the Apple iPad calculator for 15 years isn39t how they should utilize their incredible HW and chips Nice to see Brandon in the video Ipad would never replace a macbook for users like programmers it39s is not a full OS after all and dedicated for specialized users I bought Xiomi pad 6 pro for around 400 and more than happy about itbrno need to overspend for tablet iPad pros will be pointless until they the give it MacOS Does it have a Calculator Enjoy I simply wish one will just put it forward that Apple is Terrible This was a boring one 13 inches LOL yuk That39s not a laptop replacement I wouldn’t be surprised if the new version of iPadOS will be just be macOS with a couple features removed It does feel like the iPad Pro line are now being made as a smaller MacBook without being called a MacBook quotapple didn39t Want To Buy This Tablet Over Mackbook They Want You To Buy Bothquot Hits Different😂😂😂😂😂 Get a VOXI sim if you go cellular Impressive technology But still just an overpriced gimmick Why So you could show us too many ads throughout this video of course brbrCongrats on your new toy btw شغل عالي Even if i was the richest I would no way throw my money on this product No way worth it I love my iPad Pro and the upgrades are amazing  Why do you say it can ONLY do HALF of what iPad can do  Tell me what Apple seems to be the choice for angry unsecure people who dont enjoy freedom and dont embrace diversity first time with a magic

ethernet speakers and a nice large monitor I jack in my Samsung Note10 and get a full desktop of my phone that solves all task handling emails calenders surfing Netflix Youtube etc I can jack in my iPad Pro and use that as well very convinient Or I plug in my work laptop for working It separates life cleanly and is very simple Then on my ethernet I have a large NAS where all files are located and synced to The iPad was bought mainly for the PEN Drawing and painting scribbling and writing but large portion of all media consumption is on the iPad I will probably not by another PC and never ever Windows based I have a few Linux setups and they solve most of all tasks I cannot do on the Samsung phone or iPad It is very convenient to use Proxmox and virtual Linux servers and desktops As

anything for 3 months no food no gas etc Then i would be able to buy a 3600 tablet What about the repair an iPad It’s way too thin  it would bend so easily  I don’t think people care for a super thin tablet  Apple needs to stop what should i buy celluar or wifi Remember iPhone 6 bend gate For the likes and subscribes Does the nano texture make the pencil feel different based on friction You talk way to much Yo a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a that was straight up a violation LMAO but can it run Crysis you have too much money😢 And stuck with iPadOS nice I suppose Ipad Os still doesn39t really allow you to code on it without going through so much hurdles Someone give me this kind Because you’re a rich YouTuber who will make money on this video That’s why now we can play Candy Crush in 8K😂 من جاي بفيديو دراغونوف 😂😂😂😂 please stop using bots to cheat youtube its not fair on other content creators So you are boasting that you spent nearly 4k on a tablet that should cost no more than 1500 Why would some one spent this much I39ll do with samsung Nice ad I39m sorry but a tablet has no business being that expensive Go ahead and buy car and leave ipad for applefanboy 😅🤣 So now i phone gonna realise thaire phone world most slimmest phone ever😮😮😮 im worried the processing power won39t be able to keep up with non apple softwares like davinci resolve and photoshop Will these companies optimize their programs for ipad or would i be stuck with longer rendering times due to the lack of power compared to my macbook dawg make iphone 16 review mrwhosetheboss a

no amount of time will mater to an average Joe who has to get up and work every single day as a matter of fact im glad you spent that much time I hope you spend more time actually Title Why I spent 3600 on ipad Pro m4\\rbr\\rbrMe Because you need to make a review video did he really order it And because he39ll make more then that off the video The title is disingenuous I think it’s more like I’m rich and can make videos of this xD Not just one review Recently I39ve stopped watching MRWTB videos They are flashy really well made etc But core reason why I39ve watched his videos were cause of my decisions should I buy this or that product Now it39s I run benchmark on mobile It overheats it39s really bad phone Meanwhile Serbian Youtube Channel called Benchmark did do pretty professional review of the same phone where they did mention overheat on 3d Mark benchmark I think they still showed how phone doesn39t have any problems with any games overheating or daily use outside that same benchmark highly recommended it while MRWTB was sceptical of it by not doing properly something that almost nobody uses and doesn39t have any usebrbrSo yeap Flashing products money and doing for videos for views and money isn39t that cool to look at anymore ddrfreak4578maybe for you but to the other millions of people that watch his vids it seems they find them entertaining 😂 your just hating on him to try to advertise the other guys yt channel and mrwtb vids are filled with a lot of useful info ddrfreak4578 You should never base your decision buying a product based on any video especially just one video\\xa0Go into forums read user stories and experiences this kind of issue will be talked about by users brI always source on google for quotthe name of the productquot  issueproblem brAnd If you can39t find enough information from real users it39s a sign you need to wait longer \\u200bddrfreak4578 I can39t agree more Less info and more gimmicks Because MrWhoseTheBoss is an Apple super fan or being rewarded by Apple and thus there will never be a price point which he would say things are getting ridiculous I think he’s focused on lifestyle We understand the technical but I watched this for an informed opinion on how does he feel it will fit into his life As when you have the money for it it’s the practical that matters It’s the feeling I want him to convey I can search the benchmarks easily What I want is his opinion on how this fits into the ce ecosystem MRWTB videos still looks like a apple fan not able to review impartially  For a change CNET ipad review is more refreshing and more honest All of them once they get famous they just try to make you buy the new thing every single timebrbrI mean like who would spend 3600 for iPad OS replacing their Windows or Macbr0000000001 of people brbrSkip this video And because he has over 18million subscribers…that helps 😊 yousefghaleb5229this chic As soon as possible 4k go bye bye Cannot wait Where’s the review video👀 Can we run macos on ipad this time Because the m4 chip is too much for mobile games and ipadOS Even if we can39t run macos it would be good if they bring keyboard and mouse support to games ddrfreak4578i suppose I get your point his videos have become less professional reviews to just entertaining videos in general But I never watched his videos to make a decision about buying products I only watched them purely for fun Thats why I prefer the videos he does now \\u200byousefghaleb5229man ya39ll are so freaking harsh for absolutely nothing 😂brthe guy39s a tech reviewer new tech came out he reviewed it PERIOD obviously he39s making money as he should because ITS HIS JOBI39m a tattoo artist I39m 100 buying this and i appreciate there39s people like him explaining what we39re getting in a few minutes with the product in hand this is a professional tool not a quotreplacement quot for you pc or mac but an additionthe  ipad pro and procreate is used by 100 of tattoo artists i knowif you39re constantly travelling you won39t take your mac in your backpack same can be said for students or businessmen for example if you would use an ipad PRO keyword PROto watch YouTube or Netflix you clearly DON39T NEED an iPad pro and just maybe shouldn39t be watching the reviewI mean if ya39ll that mad he39s making bank and hate the product or brand that much one would think that would  be the right thing to do 😂brFor me PERSONALLYfor  the time i saved stenciling and doing montages since the iPad pro came out SEVERAL HOURS PER WEEK34 or 10k is NOTHINGbest investment i ever made \\u2060Adityasharmajl2sqI wouldn’t say he’s not able to review impartially considering he did just release a video where he lists all the problems he’s had with the iPad Pro and why it’s not the best device to completely replace his MacBook He has also called out certain iPhones in the past Wouldn’t go as far to say that he’s just a fanboy for them imo a very nice one lol i have one built for around 3500600 euro haha Sponsored by us we bring the views and revenue 😅 I mean he might be right or wrong Nerfed Macbook Arun i thought you of all people would know apples business model by now considering the fact that you39re neck deep into the apple eco system Do you know why the iPhones are never as good at multitasking when compared to androids despite being just as powerful if not arguably more Because sales on the ipad would drop wguch is apples solution for multitasking on the mobile side do you know why they39d never give the ipads the same functionality as macbooks Because the macbook is the end all be all for all of apples products better screens better performance better speakers It39s one the reasons why the galaxy tab doesnt sell as much as the ipads Most people that have a galaxy dont need a galaxy tab since the phone can do everything if not more than the galaxy tab can do especially the ultra phones Do you want portability get an iPhone You want portability but with better multitasking than the iPhone Get an ipad You want the overall best but dont care about portability Get a macbook Apple has given you a reason to get all these devices without letting you have an inbetween So to answer your question about apple physically handicapping their devices the answer is yes yes they do Apple would never give the same type of functionality the ipad has to the iPhone and neither would they give the same functionality that the macbook has to the ipad Unless sales of the ipad drop unbelievably low then maybe but in already apple fashion if the sales ever dropped so low they39d just end the ipad line up a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt40040a 🤨🤨🤨🤨😂😂😂😭😭😭 I actually use a Galaxy Fold phone and have a Samusng Tab S7 tablet I used to have a Surface Pro 6 tablet that had a cracked screen I utilized my protection plan and traded it for the Samsung tab We are the opposite of each other I HATE when a company says quotuse the

remove the background music  in your videos which are distracting Thanks Not the toothbrush clip Samsung will come out with something better or just as good and it will have a fair price I really don39t understand the brand loyalty a lot of people have with Apple products it39s borderline cult behavior the whole idea of an computer replacement crashes in the moment you get to know this ipadOs So far the older ipad pros since the 2018 model are as capable and nearly as fast in daily use as this new ones It39s not the hardware that has to improve it39s the software Can you try tecno go spark 2024 Look forward to Zach literally folding this thing in half great ad  except i think it missed the quotadquot notice Wth 3600 no IPad should be over 500 There is no but  When people will boycott apple  It’s amazing how all these insecure Samsung fanboys obsess more over new Apple products than people that are actually interested in buying those Apple products You guys really need to get a life It’s pathetic at this point I’m going to get the iPad Pro M4 11 Inch model for Christmas or the new iPad Air but my first choice is the M4 iPad Pro Don’t be fooled it cannot replace your laptop even with the keyboard Doing basically everything you describe already on my 500 Tab S7 FE Sooo you39re saying that you39re better off buying a 1000 laptop for schoolwork  a 500 tablet for entertainment instead of one 3600 fragile piece of glass that locks you into their overpriced ecosystem yer completely disagree with you here first off for me to even think of buying a tablet it has to be cheaper then my laptop not more expansive and the small perks you said dont out weight the what i can do on a laptop at all i dont care about a camera on the back of it nothing here sold me the only thing i got from this clip is that you can afford crap that i cant so its already if you waste money please walk down the aisle with your laptop in your hand That is crazy thin and super powerful Whenever you replace your MacBook I would gladly accept it 😂 Where’s the ultrawide camera love this advisement 🎉 Why no reviews for iqoo 12 was curious about it This is a youtube shorts kids dream 😂 hooray it is now a laptop just a bit more expensive 2 TR bites wow Same old story😅 Apple is actually Better than Samsung Bro he’s so close to passing Apple Wow I’m impressed Brain washed people are gonna buy it for that price 😂 Dude’s secretly launched the foldable iPad’s The fact that you can also transfer your notes and everything from an iPad to a MacBook and vice versa easily is scary good huh  you can do this with any computer are you a time traveler from 2002  \\u200bEricBarthDevWhat time travel machine is he using Is it from Apple Remember folks PC and Android has done it first before Apple 😊😂 Well i paid £800 for a second hand Samsung S9 perfect condition with a slim keyboard cover and warranty until April 2026 I love it but thought that was a high price The only program I

to charge you 50 to 100 dollars for data sharing brbrInstead of giving you unlimited like they do with all of the other cellular devicesbrbr5060 for 50 gigs 90100 for 100 gigs  So if you get the 2tb

fact that you can’t get unlimited data is preposterous Nice Apple advertisement You should indicate in the description or somewhere congrats  right before the major recession You39re the smart one I use the desktop version of adobe photoshop with a pressure sensitive Wacom tablet for higher end retouching eg photos I take for skincare companies Would that workflow be possible on the iPad Because mobile versions are great for regular edits and colour grading but when it comes to intensive retouch I really don’t know if it can hold up Any thoughts or alternatives for this specific niche purpose Can39t wait for the 3 month review where he goes back to mbp and sells this overspecced bs I got my self an iPad Pro and now my desktop and laptop are collecting dust as it has Logic Pro on it i have

games etc you have to use the mobile version of every single app IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE WAS DEEP THROATING THE TOOTH BRUSH Cause Apple paid you way more 😂😂 He said he was hesitant to buy the Samsung tablet cuz it uses a phone chip but every othe advantage he mentions that tablets have is cuz they use phone like apps lol And Apple bumped up the size of their bigger Pro to better compete with Samsung39s Galaxy Tab Ultra It would be interesting to see a comparison since the Tabs also have DeXbrbrBut over 3000 is insane for a tablet Thats more than most high end laptops Makes me wonder how much the most expensive M4 MacBook Pro will be whenever it comes out You can buy the best Pc possible for 4k and this ipad is 3600 which is mind blowing Video Idea Buying the most Elastic Tech Man \\uf8ff can’t stop A total rip off  An iPad should never be more than 1000 I had this exact epiphany as well I brought and sold tablets thinking that it would replace the laptop but it never really did but this year I did go ahead and give it a shot and then it really worked out well and I was actually quite surprised that we had such similar ideas on this But yeah it39s been a great experience it actually recommend using Android as well No one seems to consider that with carrier deals or trade ins no one will probably actually pay that price tag Let’s see first thing he said  is weight  lol yea that a one reason to spend a small car price Weight Uhm he certainly can afford it Ok it takes over his actual computer because of weight One thing Apple quality is best However is it worth the price He’ll no How many time he mentioned weight and sizeoh let’s not forget games now He is gushing red alert Did Apple hire him They should if not please dont be a fool and stop fooling people as well How much did they pay for this advertised message Apple managed to blind yet another tech content creator You are now worse than MKHBD Samsungs S pen from 2019 was more advanced and it was given with a 600 phone instead of a 3600 worse version of laptop Now try a bend test Being rickrolled on your first scene is WILD😂 We have a saying in Serbia quotDisease is not just what hurtsquot Great Video Great Points You have a new subscriber I was hoping I could go down to one device get rid of the MacBook Air I am a little disappointed that the keyboard is not detachable from the cover but hopefully it is light enough to carry around I guess we will have to see … Thanks Meh What are you gonna do on it watch YouTube It ridiculous how much tech costs now The iPhone should not be over £700 They just go up every year in price and Apple just epext everyone to pay more as if people earn more every year You can by super powered desktop PC for 3600  I mean the only reason I would consider and iPad is for Procreate Also Apple could have a touch screen computer or an iPad that can run full software but they want you to buy two devices  They are very smart with when it comes to getting people roped into buying more I still do not think an iPad can replace a desktop or laptop computer but like I said they do not want you to buy one or the other they want you to own bothbrGaming on a mobile device or a Mac simply is a long was off to what a PC or console can do Unless you just want to play mobile apps compared to other reviews idk but this feels sponsored wired

feel dirtybrAnd i sure as hell can not pay the price they demand All this was available innsamsung tab s9 ultra  Overpriced junk Watching this video even if i will never buy this in my lifetime because i will never afford this 😂 I buy a iPad to play mobile games  no to use like a laptop Get a Samsung Android I think the iPad pro camera would be the next iPhone 16 back camera layout Yeah another shiny way to castrate the internet even more bro forgor about people who dont have phones or ipads and need websites to exist I find annoying this whole situation because a 1TB iPad cost more than my brand new alienware laptop with the highest intel card and highest graphic card that plays 4K video games I REALLY WANT this new iPad because besides gaming and making 3D animations I love drawing and dumping my iPhone pictures from my travels on it But a 1TB M3 iPad cost double as the alienware 🙃 I don’t like that Apple is choosing to test its costumers with high prices and see who is willing to pay them Right now I’ll wait for a discount to buy one TBH Not related but a request please Summer time is here Party speakers look interesting What is the best value for money RGB rollable and amazing sound quality Gee……for a top notch tech reviewer……he didn’t cover the memory aspect Long story short he bought a tablet that39s so ludicrously costly because he can pay for it and earn way more by making a video on it Truth it is Bro check oppo find x7 ultra it can buy my laptop 4 times Gaming on a Mac 😂…full stop To much money Waste money for 99 of people😂😂 ngl bought an m1 ipad pro back in 2021 still bought a macbook pro in december last year Nothing can replace a laptop I see a lot of people hating on the iPad pros now because of there extremely high expensive price tags but they have always been that way I personally don’t buy new iPad pros every year I generally buy a new one every two years but depends on what it has to offer And for iPhone pro max I generally buy one every year but again depends on what they offer in terms of changes new features I prefer Apple over android because of their design quality The difference to the M2 iPad pro isn39t so much that it can now replace a MacBook completely and can39t before 😅 also you are still missing whole office implementation with word PowerPoint and Excel I bought a M1 ipad pro with the magic keyboard and imagined I39d use it for everything but in reality I39m still on my desktop all day as it39s so much quicker LOL today my wife who has a 2018 iPad Pro that can do 90 of the stuff in this video ordered

convince that price tag many things are just showoff ill get a ipad when it allows me to do coding and development work which will prob never hapen So Samsung tab is wayyyy better 😂 That is tim cook

that Samsung Ultra phones have Samsung DEX mode  this is when you connect your phone to a screen and a keyboard with mouse  and you got a desktop experience from a mobile phonebrbrI gave it a try and my conclusion is it can replace my work laptop used mostly for zoom and teams meetings The only thing I find annoying is that in DEX mode the phone cannot make use of an external webcamera that I use

do anything close to a full macbook pro how dare you compare remarkable with the stupid apple crap You are rambling saying a whole bunch of nothing lol There39s literally been no justification for that price at all Do yourself a favor get the best tablet ever Samsung tab s9 for a fraction of the cost and way better features AYOOOOO that toothbrush technique is crazy One thing that I’m super disappointed is that but the Air M2 and iPad Pro M4 doesn’t support Apple Pencil 2 but it supports the lower end USBC Pencil  So if I were to upgrade and get either one I need spend another 130 for a pencil  The second disappointment is that there are two different Magic Keyboards for the Air and Pro the Air doesn’t have a function role and have smaller keys like the ESC and Delete but cost the same as the Pro keyboardbrbrI don’t feel like a need a Magic Keyboard and I’m just as happy using my fullsized foldable keyboard and trackball when I need a computer like setup  But I use Apple Pencil a lot so I’m on the fence instead of upgrading my Air 4 I will wait another two years for a new Air or maybe a Pro  Or should I get a new Air and Pencil Pro… Can39t believe even this guy just start to be a fanboy Crazy how Apple just see and does everything for the fanboys Although i wasn39t expecting Mrwhostheboss becoming the next Tim Cook problem with most tabletssurface pro excluded they are saddled with a essentially smartphone OS if they had full fat linux on them they would be far more usefullbryes i disagree they are still just big phones 😢in my country a second hand Mercedes Benz C200 costs 2700 Tbh I have an iPad pro from like 2 years ago And I honestly do not use it It39s the most useless device I have They need to create iPadOS Pro to get the juice out of these beasts Bro was really getting in with that toothbrush if you know what I mean 😂 You got to love Apples sales strategybrThe Pencil is still only 12900😵\\u200d💫😄 All of your use cases sum up to about 2 maybe 3 uses a month imo Why Because you have the money to buy it 3600 for an iPad Pro as configuredbrbrHope you get enough value out of it to justify that pricebrbrAnd it only has 16 GB RAMbrbrWell it is very portable… Considering how frequently my M1 Ipad crashes and bugs It doesn39t matter even if they add a M100 Fix that shitty OS Make file transfer across pcphone easier Provide more free apps brI

to watch youtube and do some browsing lets be real thats what you end up doing with it anyways and a professional drawing tablet thas crazy and all but im on a macbook m1 air rn and i cannot genuinely see the difference between the m3 or m4 and m2 really they are better get me right but this macbook can do anything the other macbooks and macs and ipad39s can Yes yes but it still has iPadOS Not going to replace Mac anytime soon Q Why Mrwhoseheboss spents 3600 on the iPad Pro M4brA To show others why he39s the boss I got my iPad Pro m3 for 100 free Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra Fun fact convert that money it’s costs for that tablet you’ll see in south Africa it’s not nice living here iglad really  😂😂 nice video though Why not a surface iPad Pro isn39t ready until we get a Pro OS  The File system is garbage on the iPad And let39s not talk about Adobe Creative suite lmao it39s still ipad os You spent it because you had the money  no other reason I don’t have the money so i can’t spend on it sadly  Don39t forget that you can also easily pair an apple mouse to iPad now too I do it regularly That will cost 10k or more where I live thats a no from me dawg The tipping point should come with a complete rebrand The desktop iMac should revert to Macintosh or Mac G10 or something and the portable Mac which is the iPad should be just called the iMac In the near future there will be no discernible benefit to a laptop meaning the MacBook can die and just leave us with Mac for desktop and iMac for portability That is my dream I still use my iPad 7th over my 13 pro max sometimes I don’t carry it around outside Would upgrade to the iPad 10 this year Ok so you picked up a subscriber Excellent presentation Thanks I thought you spent the money to impress the girls  lol jk Hi ive been watching your videos for almost two years now ill like to request that on your next samsung review please 🙏 ask samsung why isnt good lock on some other countries like south africa while we get the same phone with same chips im currently using a S23 ultra I’m late Just make it a bit thicker so it can have a larger battery Things have gotten smaller and now things should last longer without charging every few hours No Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra 51mm Imagine if they made it 7mm and it had double the battery life You know to make the new iPad better make a video about the best cases for the new iPad Pro for the 11 13 inchbr Like about three for the 11 and 3 for the 13 lime ranging from like least strongest to most strongest Watching on my iPad 2024  M4 edition ✅ quotTo review it and make tons more in profitquot So I also just did this Patiently waiting for delivery … yeah right Now before you all complain I am STILL using my 129 IPad Pro series 1 NL2J2LLA  A1653 It does almost everything I need it to do minus Apple Health decent video editing and a few apps out there that do LiDAR scanning and 3D modeling Some areas I would like to get into When I bought this one I also though it was insane to spend 2000 on a tablet but that tablet has lasted me 9 YEARS So that is 222 a year over that time Well worth the specs and performance is has So the 3600 for this new one expect to get the same out of it is 400 a year It also has done so much and has been so flexible I cannot list all the apps that have been used on here to perform some simple basic task Yeah a MacBook could probably do the same but I cannot press a block on the screen to get it to work I have to have a keyboard or mouse with it and when desk space is tight and in most of my cases nonexistent it was great to just interface with the screen and done I think Apple is very close to “correcting” iPadOS and actually allow Mac OS apps to just work on it when that happens I think all those MacBook users screaming about the cost will be screaming for the iPad Pro If you decide to give the tablet away I could really use one for my business ventures Amazing channel Keep up the great videos You can find a lot of other good tech products for significantly cheaper Best of luck to ya Is actually anybody here using stage manager If you think today is the day Youre wrong Apple will only do this when they feel  you are over ready My 3080 and i7 cost 1800 quid what the goofy is the purpose of buying such an iPad I absolutely hate the fact that all websites are becoming more and more smartphoneapplikebrbrI have a computer and a BFM Big Fucking Monitor for a reason I am capable of having a lot of information on there and processing itbrThe appification of it all just completely ruins that for me AND I39M NOT GIVEN A CHOICE ABOUT IT it just happens and bTHATb is what is most definitely pissing me off most about that I39ve chosen a PC for a reason give me websites and services that fit a PCbrbrFuck apps and the appification of everything digital I don39t care The thin form factor all of it I39m sticking with my 4th gen for the foreseeable future I heard rumors that we were finally getting a 1617 inch size but alas NOHUGE DISAPPOINTMENT Why why why does Apple NOT listen to their customers big wants Just like Samsung not listening to the millions who have been asking for an on board spen on the Galaxy Fold Years of NOT listening to us Especially the digital artist community These companies kinda suck in the listening to their buyers realm and it39s getting very old LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL 3600 BAWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA You are an iPad guy my dude Nope not there yet i will not buy until the vesels are not thin and also the camera on the front must have also camera on the side You make a shitload of money from youtube why should you care spending 3600u make 10 times more with this video alone rare footage of arun not recording in his bedroom Wtf Spending 28k on a tablet You have to be RICH to even consider that dont know if its just me but i felt last 2 videos are very boring guys i can either buy an ipad or a carbri already have a car lol but still 3600 dollars can get me a decent used car The old pencil did have a button didn39t it You39re living in a dream They39re crippling the iPad intentionally so you don39t just buy it only So it is not a smart buy That was so lame Sorry iPad Pro with M4 chip is a total waste of resources  especially given the horrendous cost of purchasing one I have an iPad Pro and the ONLY thing I use it for is email Apple News and the net Would I consider using it for productivity apps  absolutely But there AREN39T any worthwhile productivity apps for it I39m talking in a professional situation Yeah you can use it to take notes paint et al but that39s a far cry from a useful productivity environment I39m in the process of dumping the iPad for a Surface Pro  because I don39t have a bunch of money lying around to throw at another product that I39ll only use to read Apple News email and surf the webbrbrUnless and until Apple ports Mac OS to the iPad I would NEVER consider purchasing another iPad Actually even if Apple DID port Mac OS to the iPad I wouldn39t purchase it Why because in their self aggrandizing perspective Apple has a ludicrous habit of making apps that are useful on the Mac no longer compatible with their computersOS I run the entire Adobe CS6 suite which is no longer supported in Mac OS On the other hand the entire CS6 Suite does run on Windows So how is it that Microsoft can make an OS that still runs these apps while Apple doesn39t Another glaring example is TurboTax TurboTax runs flawlessly on my Win PC with no issues while I must quotupgradequot my Mac OS to run the current version of TurboTax I39m running High Sierra on my Mac Pro and MacBook Pro both of which run the CS6 SuitebrbrThe WORST thing Apple ever did was to go to an annual OS update quotschemequot which was simply a scheme to force Mac owners to continually update their software solely to the benefit of the software developers I also had a quotnewquot 2019 Mac Pro which I was fortunate enough to unload since it would not run any of my Adobe softwarebrbrPeople continually bash Microsoft about Windows yet how many Mac owners run Boot Camp or Parallels to run Windows apps on their Macs because there aren39t native Mac apps for their needs i’m getting it just for the OLED…😅 This is just a glorified ad for the newest apple gadgets These famous channels have been on these trends recently ur the reason why i can now stand infront of my whole class and do a speech ❤😭🤞 Omg… can get a high spec gaming pclaptop for that price🤯😅 Fastest and most technologically advanced device to watch Netflix and YT vanilla Not even revamced a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6731113a has this guy ever used a mouse Trackpads suck big time for any work The apple trackpads are better than others but they are still well trackpads There is a reason almost no one buys a trackpad for a desktop and almost everyone with a laptop has a mouse connected to it He may have gotten used to using trackpad i also feel the same cause now when i try using mouse it feels way more sensitive except gaming As a coder I use trackpad but anything remotely close to editing always use mouse G102 You lost me at Samsung This is a new note 7😅 boom boom You are crazy dude I though the same about the ipad m1 and spanking new keyoard useless Ipad is a waste of money unless you are an artist Its a thumbtraplol You will run back to your mac after 1 day🤣 When I watched Marqueses  video on the iPad pro he said that the nano texture glass kind of makes the contrast worse This is not an IPad for the average person  It39s crazy stupid expensive  If you are filthy rich then you don39t worry about the cost  I am not It39s not that apple uses a laptop processor for an tablet it is more like they are using a mobile processor for their laptops Any remotely demanding application that is not hardware accelerated will kill each of these devices They are made for a specific niche primarily for musicians photo editors and video editors Thats why you have a very fast video encoder in the M SOCs since this will help with rendering videos CPU based rendering would take ages on an M chipbrAll current Apple devices are useless for any usecase that needs raw power and doesnt use hardware acceleration like neural engine or the video engine br3D modelling is a pain in the ass as well as compiling applications from source CAD is completely impossible in a professional work environment due to lack of software like Solidworks or Target3001brYeah AutoCAD got ported to macOS after many years but Solidworks is still the industry standard for a lot of branches brOverall GPU Performance is a complete joke on the current lineup especially on the devices that are sold for desktop use iMac Mac Mini Mac ProbrAlso compatibility is a BIG issue on macOS and iOS You just do paperwork browsing the web and composing emails sucks to be you buy a new device after 7 years or say goodbye to your internet connection because new CAs dont get implemented on old versions and therefore websites that use HTST are not accessible There is so much wrong with the apple ecosystem that the benifits are rarely worth the restrictions you have The iPad really needs to run osX if you39re going to stick a keyboard and trackpad on it This guy is going to use it just for safari and notes It is not a full on computer the problem is the software Affinity Designer work only with the iPad monitor The secondary monitor is not supported for all apps We need MacOS version for iPad 3 days ago I was wondering if i should get an iPad for my pc now I think I might If it had normal operating system then it would be usefull but it is still only tablet with mobile apps Waste of money This is just silly Apple should just make a laptop that has a touchscreen and kill the iPads already Why don’t we have a MacBook with touchscreen in 2024 Why Smh hey bro nice video keep up the ggod work You39re basically realizing the benefits of the Surface Pro line over a decade later but still facing compromises on the functionality thanks to iPadOS Every use case you described is literally how I39ve been using the Surface Pro since 2013 and currently using a 1TB SSD 512GB MicroSD 32GB RAM i7 Surface Pro 7 in conjunction with 43 Apps from the Play Store It truly is a handy 4in1 Tablet  Digitizer Drawing Board  Laptop  Desktop experience and I can never settle for any mono Laptop again That said I must also mention I do face some reliability issues due to microsoft quality these days but the overall uses far outweigh the issuesbrbrOnce Apple makes the iPadOS as featurerich as macOS then we39re talking That39ll definitely be an all around better experience with 0 compromises and likely far greater reliability than what microsoft has ever come up with That39ll be the first MaciPad worth my consideration Sorry I almost fell asleep  No thanks a

in the past 10 years I like Zoho Notebooks way better as of late tho can you plz watch out  bengoo g9000 gaming headset Apple making the price of the 2024 ipad pro like it is made with diamond or 24k gold or something seriously cmon what with the prices lately i get it that the chipsets manufacturing costs and all but damn over 2000 bucks for an ipad jeese lewis anyways arun i think its may be good decision to switch to ipad from a mac but i think it would be a little bit challenging to use but who knows you may like it This clearly is Apple sponsored Because you needed to make a YouTube video about it The correct answer Apple has completely lost it39s way charging way to much of a premium for technology thta nobody needs They are touting the use of final cut with the M4  they will throttle the hell out of that ipad so that it won39t melt or give somebody 3rd degree burns Their Ipad sales will be low just like Vision Pro and they will use financial engineering to keep the stock up There is nothing cool about Apple anymore I think the Vision Pro has potential but they should have released a quotmust havequot app at the same time People forget that Microsoft released an advanced headset years ago and it ended up being used by engineering and scientific professionals Waiting for jerry rig everything to rip apart 😅 quot3600 I mean that39s an obscene amount to pay for a tablet But Iquot make at least 36k per video so who cares apple close system sucks and pay that much for the apple hell no apple sucks in every way exept cameras to expensive to fix if it stops working or display brakes to hard and to expensive to fix and all must go through apple closed system just Over Prized Junk Expensive Trash Apple is trash   ok so what is next M5 M6 M100 I do not understand If Apple were just to release MacOS for the iPad this would be an actually good machine despite the price  With WWDC soon the rumors state that a new iPadOS is in the works… But honestly it isn’t enough MacOS needed Fully windowed and professional OS Since 2019 my ENTIRE YouTube channel videos have been editing exclusively on iPad Not even my Mac with LumaFusion brAnd now with multicam

👌 another good apple ad from this channel I don’t think that’s a laptop or pc replacement you still don’t have access to steam or any computer programs like actual drawing studios or computer games but ether way pretty cool just not worth the price It39s just a tablet after all No MacOS so it39s just a glorified 13inch phone How long until this 3600 USD slab of glass is obsolete I’m watching on ipad you bought it because you run a tech review channel omgad bmw m4 Jerry rigs everything will have a field day with it M4 chip to play angry birds and watch paw patrol you shouldn39t drink so much

courage to express his personal opinion  regardless what the crowd think or want him to say 👏 Courage  Bro this is a tech channel  If he ran into a burning building to save an old lady thats courage iPad kids 💀💀💀 I believe there is only 1 camera at the back of the newly about to release m4 ipad pro Tell me I39m wrong When you make videos of new products of Apple or Samsung it sounds like words of a fanboy What is the name off the editing app BECAUSE YOUR NOT VERY SMART   ALL APPLE PRODUCTS ARE A RIPOFF  ONLY POPULAR  BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND THE THING TO HAVE  LIKE EXPENSIVE SHOES THAT U CANT AFFORD quotWhy I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4quotbr for content I am a huge fan of iPads since day one But let me tell you after one and a half years without a PC or Mac I also bought a Macbook again and that was a big relief Why As mentioned in the video I can confirm that the file system is a mess especially when you work with cloud storage I lost so many files while editing PDFs Btw PDFs crash regularly when I leave notes on them Lastly multitasking still doesn39t work well nit even with stage manager When putting another window in the front some apps stop refreshing and just forget the last edits you made  even something like word and the app does not give you all the tools you have on a real computer All of these problems don39t have anything to do with hardware these are all software limitations And they will probably stay So no you probably won39t replace your laptop with an iPad unfortunately I still hope for iPadOS 18 but this will be another disappointment I guess AVP 👽 brRight  and  like that  they won39t ever come through  We Nevermind  but they lost  twice  so throw a tantrum  cause the other kid won something  Mrwhosetheboss I use the lowest spec iPad air 4 and managing files using the file manager isn’t half bad I use an external SSD since it doesn’t have enough storage I have to turn off the iPad every time I want to disconnect the SSD so that no files get corrupted since there is no safely remove option that’s the only problem I have The fact that it isn39t that what will bring Apple the most money It39s them producing for the first time a 12399 ipad air And it won39t surpass the 900  So if you39re not an editorarchitectdesigner or artist you now can get this huge screen with an M2 chip too for a good price comparing to the ipad Pro Software hasn’t changedbrYou can’t put the M4 to maximum use so that’s already overpowered brSo on what point have you made the decision now and not 23 years ago when m1 iPad came out Just being lighter and having a slightly better Apple Pencil doesn’t justify you paying almost £3k I am watching in ipad I39d buy it only to play pubg A disadvantage you may ask It does not have a calculator app  He probably already has division bro I mean that’s basically what is mine is a Mac without macOS There are many videos on YouTube showing people experimenting with using iPads as their only computers I wonder why everyone goes back to their laptops or desktops I also tried using iPad as my only computer but gave up after not being able to log into my school39s online class Editing a long paper in MS Word on iPad is also extremely uncomfortable iPad is still a quotnice to havequot piece of tech i rather fund my wedding for that amount lol Fully leveraging an iPad Pro M4 in some hyperproductive fantasy is the equivalent of buying a GoPro because you fantasized about wearing a squirrel suit and flying through a canyon in the Alps Ain39t happening quotThey39ve had a pretty big redesignquotbrbr Looks almost exactly the same as it did 6 years ago I have an M1 MacBook Pro with an M1 iPad Pro and I use both for work and the reason I have both is the ability to use my iPad as a second screen It has become such a useful feature for me if I am not at home where I have a full desktwin monitors setup being able to travel with my MacBook amp iPad means I can be just as productive anywhere I am I could not do this before with my MacBook only because I always need a second screen for the type of work I do iPad39s are not essential in any sense but they are an amazing tool and definitely the best tablet money can buy Same I love having that second screen on the go Can you gift a cheapest ipad air I have a dream to illustrate there through procreate 🥹 Oh dear  I predict a maximum of one month until you post the video on how working with the iPad is so restrictive that you39re moving back to the MacBook Pro Unless the next version of iPadOS brings some unlikely major changes So you are not the first one to have it brHow will we know you really ordered itIf not smart move I learned something😎 Im using a 32gb space phone while someone is using a 8tb devicebeing poor surely has its limitations That Remarkable without subscription plan is every college student39s dream gadget😂 AND Is it the oled will burn in Basically an IPad Pro is a less useful MacBook Pro with a touchscreen How does the new keyboard feel I have the older version and I don’t like it… it makes my iPad feel like a half baked Mac… Apple is a publicly traded company that answers to their shareholders They39re not stupid to allow iPads running MacOS to cannibalize their Macbook salesbrbrThey make more money selling two different devices that have 2 completely different target audiences instead of selling 1 device that can do it all Great sweater What is the brand We need a white guy that does reviews Having an App Store makes the software you can run so boring The extra steps in getting software out there means that most of the programs are sterile serious and have 39business models39 Yuck There is a place for that but I want computing to keep its casual fun side ie an open source thing a few people hack at or a game made over a weekend in a game jam  I feel like maybe an iPad can be a laptop replacement for someone who is sick of computers or scared of them 3600usd on cocomelon accessories hahahaha as a Samsung user I still just laugh at Apple users This video and the comment section just prove how much yall drink the koolaid from apple lol No tablet is worth 3600 dollars There was ABSOLUTELY nothing in this video that justified the price tag of this tablet The best part about it too was you can only pair the tablet with apples own design of the magic keyboard for 350 dollars haha 😂 I have the 6th Generation of ipad pros and honestly the biggest perk is goodnotes which lets you handwrite on the screen But i am dissapointet that there are some apps like Microsoft 365 that dont have all the functions though my tablet has the processing power to do them Battery is what you forget to talk about but it is something important So that you can make a vid about it

iPad Pro M2 11inch The iPad to me is always an annoying device to use for computing Back in the days even browsing on the iPad is frustrating The iPadOS experience has come a long way and it has become increasingly better brAbout a bit more than a year ago I got my own MacBook after using a slow family PC for years I fell in love with macOS disclaimer it is macOS Ventura when I first used macOS It almost feels like the functionality of Windows combined with the intuitive elements of iPadOS brSlowly I picked up hobbies like coding in an IDE video editing with an NLE and music production with a DAW I also use productivity software like Excel This is when I realize the limitations of iPadbrWhen Apple made the Magic Keyboard I decided to give it a try However trying to make an iPad more like my mac makes it frustrating to use I finally came into the conclusion that my iPad is only useful for 3 thingsbrbr1 To be used as a portable second screen for my MacBookbr2 To use a stylus on it for apps like Apple Notes Procreate and Affinity Designer 2br3 To use it when a tablet make sense like in a park at a lecture or at a meetingbrbrI sold my Magic Keyboard and I am never going back I will not try to make an iPad more like the MacBook People would hate me for saying this but I think that Apple is going in the wrong direction with the iPad Apple currently makes lots of products and their recent iPhone 15 lineup and MacBooks are great The AirPods are doing great even the Apple Watch However even Apple themselves are confused with the iPad as a product category putting them in this weird spot with the MacBooksbrI propose that they stop making the Magic Keyboard and instead add touchscreens and stylus support for all their MacBooks Alternatively we can even have an ordinary tablet running iPadOS and it would literally become a mac when docked on a Magic Keyboard I’ve been using Ipad Pro 2018 for the last 5 yearsbrbrI bought the Ipad for 1100brApple Pencil gen2 for 150brA cheap Bluetooth Keyboardmouse for 15brbrthese 1265 made my life and my Med school years 100x easier and I never even needed a laptop the OLED screen and the M4 are nice but i‘m not gonna upgrade my 2020 Pro BECAUSE of the thinness 👀brit‘s so scary my old one already bent a little just by carrying it around in a backpack for schoolbrWHO asked for a thinner iPad Whats better ipad pro m1 2021 or

Channel But you all are missing the point when it comes to the iPad OS vs MacOS For example you should ask your editors if they would use the new IPad to make one of your videos Apple markets these IPads for creators in factor their whole brand towards creators yet they give us the power but hold out by making subpar apps Not everyone is going to get it specked out the base model is like 100 or 200 dollars more than a iPhone 15 pro max😭😭 because you are a YouTuber and then you will probably make 8k on the reviews If you invest 3600 then you can make 1 million dollars 💰 then why people buy tablet with phone features i feel the same whit capcut I guess saying you39re shying away from Samsung tablets for using a mobile chip is kinda a biased opinion what can39t it do that the iPad with the macbook chip can do Give away please I need it to learn Waiting for a good android tablet for gaming  lesser than m4 apple without heating issue glad i not iphone fan👍😀 For clout This guy annoys me to death The macbook being the bridesmaid in the wedding There is only one way to describe spending 3600 for a tablet and it39s not polite at all to mention it The most specked out iPad in the US

when wealthy people complain about a price of something is it to try to relate to the audience Is it an honest reaction I have no idea but I know I just watched you destroy three new iphones Something

developer pixel joy It’s more expensive than the apple vision pro I think the biggest benefit of the slim size is the fact that you can easily add a case  keyboard to it without it adding too much weight I also don39t think the comparisons to macbooks are valid since it39s a different style of computer  it39s not meant to compete with a macbook and doesn39t cater to the same user group It39s the most advanced device in its category and I think Apple is trying to build the best device in the category and hoping the developers will build the apps that brings the users 26M views pay for it He39s spending 3600 on it because he can because you39re rich Apple over priced move on They need to put the full OS on it and stop halting progress Steve jobs did not fear cannibalising his own product line for the future which is why we have the iPhone and not iPod ipad is next gen game changing for students in a leveluni That smart toothbrush was goin crazy 😅 Imagine Apple creating a dedicated Apple Gaming Controller and playing GTA 6 on the OLED 13 inch Would that make people buy it Fun Fact An iPad with magic keyboard is even pricier than MacBook Air However MacBook Air can satisfy almost every kind of litePCwork including Office Video Editing as well as simple coding For the iPad it isn39t stable on the laptop while typing and it is on the table of train brTo edit photos MacBooks is capable enough because of its fundamental file management as well as desktop softwaresbrSame Price but with fewer capabilities I got an iPad with the magic keyboard in 2021 and it replaced my MacBook It’s honestly my an all rounder Allows me to work and take meetings on the g and I use it for watching and entertainment I would actually skip the pencil as my handwriting is so bad andthe magic keyboard with the trackpad Since the iPad is a touch screen I don’t really use the trackback To date still one of my best purchases nah logitech combo prolly coming to 2024 pro We dumped Mac Laptops for all ipad maybe 3 years ago Best computer decision I’ve made I will only consider getting one unless it39s not going to be bent as easily as the previous gen more money than sense The galaxy tab s9 ultra is 055mm thin at 145quot  the new Apple tablet is 052mm thin at 13quot brbrAre those 002mm really that noticablebrbredit especially when you slab a case on it anyway Is it not like marvelling at quotthe new daring colours and textures of those amazing new phonesquot  and then putting them into a 20 ISK bumper case from AliExpress The lack of a proper filing system is just a deal breaker for me Dropbox is pretty awful on iPad too You can’t connect to network drives in a sensible way either Great for media consumption not so great for creating it So simply put will the phone eventually have enough PC level ability to make a Desktop Laptop Tablet devices obsolete Work whole life n buy apple tablet that is life goal 😂 Can you gift me one Most expensive YouTube Kids and Netflix device ever I am watching this video brand new in My redmi pad SEsounds good Unjustifiable cost Hopefully this is the start of them bringing the super slim 12inch MacBook back Don’t drop the iPad it might fly away The BIGGEST problem with IOS as a laptop replacement is its lack of ability to manage files  If they did that… then I can migrate to an iPad Get a NAS instead of iCloud and large devices  why u talking in the dark does it bend More Crap from Apple Cringe Nah nah nah I love this channel but be real my bro the reason ya made a video on it is tax write off 😂😂😂 Lol snapdragon x is coming to takeover I didn39t think i would ever feel this way about mrwhosetheboss video but damn arun 🫠 this gotta be the stupidest video you ever created 😬 it39s silly to compare laptop to iPad they39re very few niche use cases in which ipad could be good replacement but other than that it39s big no Samsung 14 feel is better product and beside nothing wrong with 129 pro Bro how did you get that Pokémon wallpaper anyone know I still use a tablet I use an Amazon fire and it39s great 😂 🎉 Nope Will wait in a year or two Guess I don39t need a MacBook Replaced the complete macbook fr Don39t know about you but consuming your content makes me iGlad 😂 I never understand people outside of graphic designers who prefer an ipad over an actual laptop where you can use a real key board and real programs not just apps To get more views 😂 I trying to replace everything with an iPad since 2018 99 of daily business tasks is no problem I even miss some IPad features when using the MacBook for the remaining 1 But as soon as you hit pro tasks Pe editing 1k Fotos import export things take so long I think the IPad is too fast for most usecases but not fast enough for pro cases For me it is not langer a OS thing it‘s performance in pro tasks But doesn’t ipadOS really hold back the functionality of this beast 😱😱😱 If your intention is to do serious work then you will regret this move iPadOS cannot currently replace MacOS or Windows  You’ll see Talks about how he struggles to find a need for a “tablet” and then 1 minute later says he always carries a paperlike writing tablet everywhere he goes because “sometimes you just want write things down” LOL…so which is it then iPad Pro with Pencil can do the same plus is way more versatile as an actual computer vs a dedicated writing tablet Honestly an iPad ProPencilKeyboard combo is the ultimate and most versatile device for daily carry If you can adjust to doing PCtasks in an iPad workflow you can probably satisfy 95 of your computing needs while onthego If you really need macOS while onthego then you can remote in to your Mac but those needs are probably few and far between unless you’re trying to record a podcast while out on the town 😂😂 Ayo that toothbrush part looks sus bruv That is really the coolest Tee I have seen for long Where did you get it me convincing myself that i made a good purchase There was a time when apple Steve Jobs era used to upgrade product lines and lower the price Or offer a more affordable product line Aww the good ol days where apple products where affordable and useful I’m been in Apple since Apple IIe 😂  Now my setup two pads multiple screens with a docking station 😅 The videos are like Neverending thumbnails if Jobs was around this would have probably been holographic All this power and capability and we can’t get a freaking calculator app Watching this on Xiaomi pad 6s pro 😂 S23 ultra guy here I have an ipad air 4 and while apple advertises new releases like its going to change my life in most cases rarely does I39d rather wait a year or two longer for the tech to normalise and for more people to have general use opinions Yes it looks wonderful but at those pricing levels the market is going to be thin Remember Apple sell around the world Outside the US and G7 countries the existing range is a luxury and often retails for more than in the US If Apple aren’t careful so e other manufacturer is going to come in and with a cheaper product steal their lunch Yes leaving the Apple family is difficult but how much would a top of the range Ipad Iphone and watch cost you There are two kinds of people in this worldbr1 Uses Applebr2 Just watch other people use apple coz they know deep inside nothing can beat a beefy windows gig Tbh you39ve repeated the same stuff again and again here became boring br feedback if you use it at the profesional level you noticed the shorts The fact you said you don39t edit anymore tells that any

that Right before she will kick you out  You are probably gonna switch back to Mac soon Smart tooth brush part was kinda sus I wish they had a pro version for iPad mini I feel that’s still more useful than a 13 inch iPad trying to replace a laptop that will never happen To be honest I have both MacBook and iPad and I really love my iPad when doing my school work on the go instead of my computer I just use Apple keyboard and trackpad folio and it’s all doing very good for me Good job They would still sell a lot of em No thanks I39m fine with Galaxy A9 sub 200 tab It plays YouTube and Netflix just fine Because I’m rich biach 😂 Still can39t use VsCode or programming IDEs 16 minutes of straight yapping on a product you dont even have ur hands on yet is crazy get that bag I guess Ok ok ill go

functionalities aren39t available on apps you39d have to eventually open your laptop on browser PC mode to access those functionalities I bought the M1 tablet didn’t like it you can almost buy a used car with that amount The screen is so nice on the previous gen ipads Macbook air to pro is meh but the ipads are impressive I dont use a tablet but curious how this new one looks irl I39ve used my iPad instead of a MacBook for ten years A few weeks ago I bought a MacBook Pro And uh yeah don39t get an iPad He39s not mentioning a massive variety of things that the iPad cannot do Every website just works on a laptop iPadOS can be crap for a ton of sites and apps Trust me it39s a completely different experience Thinking about selling my iPad at this point because idk what to do with it The script of this video is from previous video The correct question is how to make a content that worth 3600 for my ipad pro Yeap Yes but Surface has been doing this for many years ago And it´s it´s doesn39t run a app OS 😉😉 Other than using the pen for drawingnotetaking I still see no use for a tablet in my life Everything a phone can do a phone can do better and everything a laptop can do a laptop can do better I don39t have anything I notice falling into that grey area in the middle where I wish I had a tablet And definitely not one that costs more than a laptop Awesome I have the previous gen iPad Air that I bought in November and fell in love with the Apple Pencil I love the fact that the new Apple Pencil isn’t compatible with the last gen iPad Good on Apple to want the best

traffic is on mobiletablet devices the web just still doesn39t feel at all designed for it to me The amount of times I39ll abandon a checkout on my phone to pick back up on my computer because I was frustrated and having issues is astronomical That39s what the tablet does best better than phone and portable and almost as good as computer experience if not as good or better I don39t enjoy searching for flights km phones but do on tablet and laptop It’s because websites are built using laptops not phones Mobile will always be an afterthought that isn’t tested as often Never really have an issue with websites on a mobile device I almost never have to use my laptop… good for Aaron that Apple made a device with a pricespecs which can only be justified by his needs jamesalexduranyeah

on iPad 9th gen 🙂🫠 Yea I bought the iPad Air 6 and though that was expensive😅 The biggest downside of the iPad has been the lack of software We are getting closer But as a 3D artist it39s not there If Zbrush is any good on the iPad later this year that would be a game changer I mean I would still need marvelous and substance but hopefully Zbrush being on iPad encourages everyone else to hop on and development There are a lot of touchscreen laptops or pc tabs iPad is only thin because it39s not supposed to handle those softwares They wouldn39t put pc operating system on it for a reason it39s because the thermals will never work with that form factor that39s why with same specs there is or will be a laptop too to do those things I feel like mrwhosetheboss using AI for this video including audio Only an idiot will spend that much on a device that depreciates over time has no Apple buy back option no self repair no more than a year of warranty very low resale value and a high performance m4 chip that just sits there with nothing powerful to process as you can’t run full fledged software on it I think it really depends on what you do Most don’t need it though brbrI might pick up a maxed out one to use for editing 1080p4k footage and pairing it with blackmagic design’s new micro colour panel It has a groove on the back for the iPad to nest into and the screen is amazing for grading footage Look it up You lost 3600 dollars 👀 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 What39s with the annoying wallpaper Imagine spending 3k on a tablet just to play angry birds Looking forward to your wedding review 🤣 I39m watching this on a 200 CAD tablet right now I cant wait to waste money for 06 mm thickness difference Buying products from Apple is like spending a percentage of your life savings to get F39d in the starfish and you don39t get to choose who does it Samsung tablets are 56 mm Not that much different from 53 to the naked eye and 14 the price and also more features but slower It39s incredible what Apple did here but honestly that39s still too heavy for my liking  I end up putting down my existing tablets because it39s just not comfortable enough to use long term  Now the technology behind it Freaking AWESOME  Just no thank you in the end for the price and weight Maybe because you have money and dont care to spend 20k and more in Apple products Very smart you turned into a laptop Next year TMobile will have these for free with a 2 year mobile plan Waste of cash why you promote this crap still waiting to get my first apple brand 🥲 damn i39ll be damned we39re approaching the PDA era I just want an iPad without cameras I don’t care for cameras and I HATE seeing doofuses using an iPad to take photos and videos Bik gayi hai ye sarkar What are you going to do about iPads39 lack of browser plugins whyy not buy M2 tablet i  can do everything M4 can using M2 ipad Doesn39t chrome os cover all these bases and has a decent file system  quotI wanted to make a video on itquot aka you can get that sht written off as a business expense LOL We see you I knew why he bought it when I saw this video has 25M views He bought it because he39s rich and because he39ll make more money from suckers who watch this video than he spent on the product And now having commented I will leave before I watch Really Arun 4000 for a tablet 😢😢 What about the poor people Because you have a youtube cahnnel The perfect tagline quotThe iPad Pro M4 When you have more dollars than sensequot It really depends the type of person you are someone that does coding or needs a file system a laptop or desktop is a lot better A gamer doesn’t want tablets or even laptops because they basically gotta stay connected 247 Now for a teacher like me who only utilizes Google classroom and basic apps it’s so easy and more maneuverable to work on an iPad It’s nice because as a SpecialEd iI can even walk around with an thin iPad and show the kids slides or concepts in a more hands on touch manner which is what some of these kids prefer and work with better Also for an artistic person that does photo editing video editing or drawing painting an iPad is amazing Just really depends on what your habits are tbh I’d say like 70 of people would work better with a PC but a lot of people are casuals and don’t really use apps specific that only work on laptops  for those it’s very nice to use an iPad Just preordered a 13” pro with 1tb in space black and I am so pumped The last time I was this stoked to get a new piece of tech I was 12 years old waiting for the Nintendo Wii What makes you more excited about this one than previous iPad Pros PressContinueToQuit that double stacked OLED mostly Also just very glad the front facing camera is in the right spot now so I won’t look like a dingus on zoom calls I love the space black and the thinness is pretty neat as well I just can’t wait to get this in my hands I prefer using an iPad to a traditional laptop this one just looks spectacular Apple actually making something that isn’t the same as the last thing that they made is surprising to me 😅 Umm because you have money burning a hole in your pocket It39s an ipad no one buys an ipad My gaming laptop is only 1000 this video was rather entertaining You have gained a new subscriber No one should ever spend 3600 for an oversized tablet Please get some help if you have already done so 🤣 Bro I thought it was 360 Just give me a M4 PRO Mac Studio and I’ll be happy My iPad Pro M1 does everything I need as a video editorcolorist an engineering student and an office employeebrbrI can video edit in DaVinci Resolve and stream using the USBC input with a capture cardbrbrI can run engineering software like Fusion 360 MatLab Shapr3D etcbrbrI can also run office XMind etcbrbrAll this with cellular data and a detachable touchscreen yes but you39re not rich He got the M4 and made millions Bro ngl you’re probably the first person ive ever heard of getting through engineering school with an iPad Where you mechanical I couldn’t imagine i mean does it support Matlab simulink how does it even handle any computationally demanding matlab tasks What about arduino ide for programming or rasp pi for flashing microcontrollers Also you can’t run ansys any Dessault programs Altium any PLC or robotics software What about 3d printing software for exporting Gcode No offense bro engineering is for windows I couldn’t imagine working on a senior design project using an ipad i think they are great for taking notes making reports or reading spec sheets But im assuming you spent a fair amount of time on the school computer because iPads literally don’t support most mechanical engineering software and its very limited I don’t know why you didn’t just get a basic dell with like a 3050 or something I personally have a macbook air but also a pc and without my pc I would’ve literally never been able to leave the computer lab Dude It’s kinda hard to believe you 😂 seriessplayer62747Engineering student here I decided to try my luck at doing my mac workload on my ipad just to see if it  was possible I couldn’t even get past the microsoft login page for my student email The literal login page wouldn’t load on my ipad And god forbid I try to code on it the only language this thing can run is Swift Awful device for college if you’re trying to use it for anything beyond note taking seriessplayer62747 I’m biomedical engineering so I need to be able to draw organic chemistry structures and take complex notesbrbrI don’t need to run Raspberry Pi IDEs MatLab actually runs in the cloud so that’s handled and I can use the departmental computer for random specific tasks like COMSOL for Fluids Modeling It39s understandable why Johny Ive has left Apple knowing that he is its brain behind the innovation However now Apple has been plagued with uninspired and unsuccessful ideas I love my previous gen iPad Pro and I am jealous of this new one and I have been an Apple fan for decades but this video comes across as a guy trying to justify dropping more than 3Gs on a goddamn tablet 😂 Have we tried the bend test yet At least people won39t really be carrying these around in their pockets and sitting on them I think the BEST thing about these new models is that hopefully it39ll continue to reduce the price of the older versions I39m still running an iPad Air2 And it39s still perfectly fine for my use case which essentially is just consuming web content messaging and the occasional email At the price does it make any sense to buy one of these instead of a Macbook for ANY Productivity use cases I39m a dentist What in the worldly fuck is a smart toothbrush Thanks for keeping me entertained I hope apple make everything thinner again Fat macbooks and iphones are a disaster Dreaming to grabs ipad one day With 3600 I would go an buy a 4090 and ok system to put it in  Oh ill put 10tb of storage in there just cus mac doesn39t give you that option The whole video honestly though fr just sounded like he was trying hard to justify paying 3600 for a tablet lol Why So u can tell us the truth about it An obscene price pays it 😂 You keep buying it they will keep pushing the price people are willing to pay You all come across as so elitist tech YouTubers None of you have had the grapefruits to plainly say quotwho is this for Who care about M4 or an oled screen at this pricequot Seriously there are lay off everywhere and I understand you39re not the makers of these devices But you are purveyors of information And it is your duty clearly tell Apple that consumers don39t want this at this price They don39t The vision pro has failed and so will this Instead you39re all too comfortable to be smiling talking heads as long as apple gives you

expensive products so influencers make a I paid the price of a used car for an iPad so you don’t have to video As a photographer editing on an iPad Pro is absolutely a pain for one simple reason the file system My workflow involves dumping my raw photos onto a NAS editing them and then saving them back to the NAS and there39s no way to do that efficiently with an iPad Why is that They added the ability to mount NAS shares into the Files app some versions ago is it just that the photo apps don39t work with them that way CubeApril Dude39s scrambling to set this up 😂 I39ll buy one when they bring the MacOS to the iPad I guess it39s good for nonpro users right now Think I39ll stick to my Tab S9 FE which cost me about 85 less than this 😂 wow apple must be paying a lot never though he39d be a sellout too sad day Bruh stop rickrolling us  I see the background Tried to replace my mac with the iPad it just isn39t there yet You constantly are hit with things that you have to figure out how to do that just work on the Mac Best of luck though maybe the new iPad will be different he talks about this like ipads never existed before more performance for what watching netflix cmon dude quotI39m gonna bring my M4 to schoolquot 💀 So first it was all about touch screens now it is about not having to touch the screens 🙃 You should check out the HMD phones new ipad means the previous one

when using this 3600 iPad I carry my laptop all the time since I spent big  on an iPad so I could leave my laptop home iPadOS still is sure we have no use for a Finder so there’s that Don’t say I didn’t warn you It quacks like a notebook As a Macbook quotLate 2011quot still rocking for music production Fanboy former iPad and iPhone User I gotta say I feel your sentiment Very much Apple do make

justified iOS without even talking about the Multitasking and notification mess What a dumbo What a waste of money So frosted glass costs 2000k I can buy semi transparent matte for next to nothing Apple is really going nuts literally Sorry but tablets will always be nothing more than huge phones to me I’ve been using my M1 iPad Pro for 2yrs now… it’s actually my main device now… I’ve got an M1 MacBook Pro which I hardly use… I just wish apple gives us Pro style apps with the exact same functionality as found on MacOS… not skimming I can live with ipadOS… just give me a full version of Logic Pro on my iPad nothing here other than incremental improvements are you going to spend another 3600 when the next tablet is lighter thinner and faster as for laptop vs tablet you clearly don39t need the functionality of a laptop but this doesn39t mean an ipad is better All i hear is quot we took everything samsung has been doing and decided to do it ourselves finallyquot I don39t think I39m the only one who would say that their parents don39t want them watching youtubers who cuss Apple don39t care They know there39s a queue of idiots willing to spend that kind of money on a pad Let the fools spend Welcome to the Apple storage game They can just as easily provide an sdxc slot but wont They can kiss my bass This is hardly the first YouTuber saying an iPad can replace a laptop Ever since the M1 iPad or maybe even earlier YouTubers have been saying that the iPad Pro is just as powerful if not more powerful than some laptop computers But guess what It been almost 4 years since the release of the M1 iPad and still the same old song The problem was never about the hardware you can put supercomputer chip inside as long as it still runs iPadOS its still nothing more than a toy for most

work but it39s really old now I don39t want to drop 3600 on a new one Tablet  Smart Plate M1 MAX still good for my iPad🗿 Never buy Apple stop being a sheep Because youre an apple fan boy Considering using a tablet as a laptop is just stupid even more with the actual iPad OS system what a wanker 8 fucking terabytes bro get off Torrent sites lol Im guessing the answer is quotBecause I can make a video on it write it off on my taxes as a business expense amd monetize the videoquot it 100 wont replace your macbook Couldn’t agree with you more I’ve been using my 105 inch iPad Pro for 7 years every day all day cost 729 still runs excellent still can get the latest updates in software Never had an issue with any problem one button touch and it’s on brbrOrdered the 11 inch iPad Pro because Apple is giving me 100 tradein plus I get another 10 education discount so the new ones only costing 800 Although my iPad Pro still works great and battery is still good figured it’s about time to give it a rest and take advantage of 100 tradein brbrI also purchased the logic tech keyboard case combo from Apple because that’s the only place you can get it right now for 229 just delivered today really nice case light up keyboard function keys and a huge trackpad but weighs practically nothing and you can just pull it apart from the magnet if you don’t need a keyboard Had a similar case for my old iPad and it still works great never had an issue Protected my iPad from a few drops All these screens devices just do the samethings at this point This is might just be an unpopular opinion but with inflation and everything that is going on I don’t think 3000 is a good price for a tablet that still runs on an iPad OS worth it Especially when Apple keeps coming out with all these different processors and it barely touches what can be done on the current OS and telling people that it’s made for creators Also all these advancements in hardware but we have a QuickTime bug when we export footage How is this still a thing when you’re spending so much money on a device built for “creative expression” How is an iPad Pro M4 more expensive than an iPhone 15 Pro Max You’re about to make me make a bad financial decision Absence of Instagram app for iPad invalidates its appeal and price  I don39t think the iPad or any tab can anytime match a laptop use case Atleast for my use cases It39s really cool to have this much power but it39s useless if I can39t run certain software or platforms on it I currently use a mid Samsung tablet and I love the ease of using with my phone and connected features and a good windows laptop which allows to run major software and costs less than the iPad itself even without considering the folio case and pencil lol That toothbrush shot was crazy bruv Yea no bro This product is for you and you only lol 10 years before an iPad feels useful  That’s not saying much about Apple’s priorities  The problem has always been the software I think the speakers are going to be terrible Just ordered with the nano screen Why Cause you39re a hardcore Apple fan duh Apple pricing is just on a different level You definitely don39t get more gaming utility from an iPad

really good video I watched MKBHD’s one and it was good but this just gives such a good insight into what this iPad could mean for its target audience What’s 3600 to a millionaire I cannot understand why the hell people use macbooks when you can just install linux on a high end laptop for less than half the price No the one main advantage that PC still has is that it is not a mac smh CLICKBAIT  he doesn’t have it guys 😂 I feel like you’re spending 3300 worth of this iPad just for a pencil …literally …a pencilbrbrSure you can play games brbrBut… so can my Xbox or PlayStation 5 my point is for some of this technology I believe will be replaced by cloud computing in the future and what your left buying is a glorified screen for 3300br brbrit’s all good though somebody’s got to spend the money  i39m just waiting for a time when the iPad and macbook are both ditched to bring out a hybrid which are better than both the Macbook and the iPad The fact the matter is this you have over 18 million subscribers you39re making a lot of money through YouTube You can afford to buy the top range iPad use it for a while and if you don39t like it return it And if you don39t like it send it to me LOL😂 You spend it to get 24M views 😂 hey Arun can i please have your old mac please At this rate Apple will release a Starbucks look a like Coffee Mug that connects with your phone and apple watch yet people will still buy it for the price Them Cupertino boys done impressing Arunbhai 😃brJokes aside  personally as an owner of a recent iPad Pro with the Mseries chip this seems an evolutionary step and likely wait for a generation or two for the OLED technology to evolve on Apple devices So from that perspective I am more in agreement with MKBHDs impressions in his quotawkwardquot video especially considering the artificial software limitations due to iPadOS versus an Mseries Macbook Pro with MacOS  brBut if this is a first iPad Pro this might not be a bad place to start The real thing about it is iPad does not work like a computer And you will not be able to use Adobe Creative Suite on it or do any hardcore computer work Because apple does not allow that kind of freedom as a MacBook So basically if you are paying over 3000 for an iPad expect an iPad functionality Unless Apple will finally give you the ability to use the full power of the iPad and be able to install computer programs to do your work But of course they would never do that because they39ll lose their computer Market StillquotNo Dual USBC39S quot With All That PowerbrGuess What Lenovo Legion Y700

different versions old apple pencils don39t work with new ipads and vice versa It is a mobile device Mobile devices are seen by industry as consumer devices not productivity devices They will never ever ever be on par with computers I wish they could I genuinely wish we could ditch laptops but sadly ipados ios android they all suffer from being a dumbed down version of a computer In fact this

Why I spent 3600 on ipad Pro m4brbrMe Because you can afford it Coz he will make lot more money from this video I still don’t see a point why anyone would spend that much money just to watch videos

you to get an iPad over a MacBook \\u200bSoosRamirez1because they want them to buy both cos the money generated from this clickbaity horseshit is greater than the cost to purchase the overpriced tablet SoosRamirez1 he can earn alot more from views So the cost of buying the tablet is petty money  Roadside121 what does that have to do with my question I see a bit of sweetening for Apple it smells a bit like a sponsored video  3600 for an ipad is nasty work quotWhy I spent 3600quotbrThe Answer Because you could Bro are you on drugs 🤣🤣 The same price as the Apple Vision Pro 💀 To have something for yet another video Yeah You didn’t sell me on this  I thought you would have BEST OF ALL it39s probably impossible to repair so they probably love that it could replace your laptop YAY DISPOSABILITY I will never switch to an iPad I prefer my MacBook Air wayyyy more Which eink device is that BUT ITS SO THIN YOU GUYS Ipad pro with geforce now and a ps5 controller playing apex legends plz there is our biggest apple fanboy of the whole internet throwing all his money on an overpriced tablet☠️ Comparing it with other tablets is not really a fair comparison when Android tablets have drastically worse chips bullishlucas yes but its to 100 not worth that amount of money chopstick134 The 3600 no but base price is 11001300 bullishlucas i got my samsung for 550 and free watch also with ipad you have to buy pencil cover too actually apples Apple TV remote is thinner I have been using Ipad Pro M1 for more than 3 years with Magic Keyboardbr and iPad Pro until now will never replace MacBook This makes me want to get the M2 iPad Air considering how much cheaper and overpowered the M2 still is Ipad is pointless Only use is as a kindle or video player 3k for a portable large screen Don’t do it It won’t work Because you like burning flaunting money like money other YouTubers Samsung39s tablets are using phone chips Okay  You can play full on Cyberpunk 2077 on the 8 gen 3 you39ll be fine with that kind of power don39t worry Pretty much a paperweight Of course when you have infinite funds you can spend it on whatever without worry Everyone just want apple to make a Surface Pro The answer is obvious  it’s because you have nearly 20 million subscribers and therefore earn enough money to buy damn near anything you want 👏 👏 Don39t waste your money Lol see his excitement go down the drain on WWDC not to mention his 3 grand 39 What’s the new game on the iPad Looks like a cool game Still not a Mac you know its bad when the ipad costs more then the vision pro like thats mad Well I am not in market for new iPad Pro Crazy money for a tablet…Yes it maybe brilliant but as I have a perfectly good iPad Pro see zero reason to update Let’s face it most people dont use their phones or ipad or even computers to their max We love having the fastest best screen lightest you name it but we only utilise a small percentage of their true capacity We buy into the hype because it sounds like we can be part of the cool crowd sitting in a coffee shop playing with our gadgets and become the next top cat this ipad is more expensive than the APPLE VISION PRO The only reason why its 3600 Is because he chose the most expensive options Thanks for going all in on the options so we feel smart not getting it Amazing video as always Love your content bro Tablets make phones inferior My phone is good when I’m out a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6011001a i will resume later Small correction  Google docs and slides are not great on IPad and specifically lack features for full time work use  I often have to do tricks to get documents to open in Safari instead of the apps to access certain functions  It’s a longstanding problem IMO I don39t understand why the M4 ipad is supposed to be 50 slower than an m1m2 macbook It makes no sense Ipad are also historically champions of longevity You can mostly still use a 7 yearsold iPad comfortably even though battery life is terrible for obvious reasons So yes I think the prices are justified given that you can keep it for 5 years and use it everywhere  it’s £60 a month OR you can just buy a much cheaper laptop and also use it 7 years Probably better to wait until you have the device before making the video Bit of a weird one I don39t care how good it is paying that much for a tablet is insane But if you got it like that keep shining 😊 Wow I just thought about that That you cannot get 5G on laptop but you can’t find iPad Honestly with this kind of power it39s not a tablet anymore It39s a competitor to a Microsoft Surface simple question why you buy it D I go on tirades this long when quothovering over the buy buttonquot too but unfortunately it39s my poor spouse who has to listen instead of 185M subscribers 😂 I feel like this whole video was just him convincing himself it39s okay to spend that much He bought it for his job Then made a video acting as if he didn39t Why I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4 Because it was worst and pointles to show how big is your  Secondly still apple has worst keyboard case ever Secondly why they still not let to change curstor on iPadOS Still too small More power is completely uselss IPad pro 2017 does everything I need IPad Pro 1639 when I don39t want to carry around a 4000 piece of glass but I guess I39m just a broke boy Yeah Apple knew that the moment they allow iPad to boot MacOS the Macbook sales will go down significantly And they don’t want that😊 Agree bro If I even had the money to buy one I’d rather take a used carbrIt’s infuriating that even the keyboard is that expensive I have an iPhone and will definitely switch back to android if it’s broken You can39t say you39d rather game on a tablet than a computer if you only gamed on Mac Pro 💀 You’ll switch back to the macbook in like 2 days iPad OS is dumb on ipad using youtube in safari desktop mode is much much much much better than the youtube ipad os app The fact that I just paid 1300 for a new iPad pro 129inch and apple pencil a few months ago feels like a slap in the face honestly but I39m not gone upgrade and it was a huge investment to my business This is wild hardware is amazing but iOS sucks total rip off Wait the iPad is HOW much Lmaooooo I have a last gen iPad Pro I use for art and sometimes for streaming a MacBook for music production and a PC for gaming 3600 can buy two of those three things and get you soooo much further in doing literally anything Apple is out of their minds these days I swear Capitalism is broken I hope the ipad mini 7 pro will have 120 hz and will be compatible with the apple pencil pro It would make sense I bought a slightly usedlike new 13 inch Ipad Pro 2020 with magic keyboard and it was great and I used it everyday But after playing a mobile game for awhile it burned the back of the screen leaving it permanently discolored Luckily it was on the edge of the screen and i for the most part not noticeable unless staring directly at it The keyboard started rip it’s outer cover after about 3 years of use Also the screen fell off because the double sided tape they used to keep it attached melted The microphone also randomly stopped working This tabletkeyboard with pen originally cost around 2k and I spent around 1200 on a lightly used model Cuz you39re a tech content creator amp your job is to review stuff couple of years ago i bought an ipad air 5th gen my son still rocks with his learning videos while i do my work on PC spent lot of  but didn39t use it LOL 😁😁😁😁 I disagree with apples power management If the battery health degrades to a certain degree the device will no longer work at all As an example this is unsafe for anyone using it for flight navigation The devices need to work when plugged in regardless of battery health Sadly apple laptops are the same Apple39s ad crushed it Didn39t think I had principles until I watched that brIt39s saved me thousands Be real

gyro thing which is a very niche use Ive been using the iPad Pro for my university notes for 3 years now and I basically have my money’s worth so the same old M1 ipad is still better value the only thing I would say is good about the new iPad is how light it is which helps for a campus dweller but the iPad air might be the better option in that case Got rid of my laptop years ago Got a MacBook

acceptable besides some stutters it is a budget to midend device after all brSo I really don39t think that average person would ever need such tablet even as a replacement of a laptop Arun I am a 8TB guybrMe who39s watching this on my 256Giggs MacM1 🥲 Answer You wanted to make content by talking about it jesus I wish Apple people would start saying quotnoquot to these new insanely priced products These new tablets bait Do browsers on ipad have the same extensions as the ones on mac Can you use bookmarklets on them Understandably this guy has a tech channel but the reality is he’s going to be surely disappointed because  iPad OS This new M4 and do the M1 as well without breaking the bank There is realistically no need for this iPad to exist until the iPad gets MacBook treatment with its software I bought into the idea of them iPad replacing my laptop and even without the keyboard there is plenty of stuff a regular iPad Air or an iPad Pro from 2020 will replace the laptop for but it doesn’t need to be the highest one to this frankly you’ll never use half of it do what I do and plug your iPad to a raspberry pi 4 if you really want “desktop replacement” even then I doubt most people would like a terminal It finna fold from a drop i actually do everything on my Samsung smartphone watch tv play games working editing documents etc I just use my laptop for protocol exclusive use a lot of windows tools and services are still required to work Huawei 132 inch Tablet are more way next level then ipad pro plus Huawei got free Pencil Apple no😂💀 That is an obscene amount of money to pay for a tablet BUT i will buy it anyways Thanks Arun 8TB on a MacBook Pro is insane to me 😂😂😂 I think 1TB would be fine w me but hey what do I know I don39t even own a MacBook Pro 😂😂😂 maybe one day I39ll save enough for one a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt8811441a brThis has such great memeing potential Why  because you are looking for views to line up your pockets I replaced my pc in 2018 I have an iPad mini 6 and Im more then satisfied watching this video on my 1000 dollar pc which is cheaper 3 times in price and faster 100 times in power One problemit39s a applebrNever again Talk what you want but 3600 for a tablet is ridiculous I will buy 2 rtx 4090 in this price Pro Software sucks on ipad os its still limited with ipad OS not worth the money older iPads Pro do the same I think Apple should make a Final Cut Pro iOS Editing App for the iPhone and iPhone Pro Seriously you were able to fill 16 minutes with info about this   You coud have stopped immedately after 3600 Everything after that was irrelevant Bought an Ipad 15 year ago and i do regret it I use it for school mostly but apps like Word and Excell aren39t optmized well enough I still need a laptop do to basic stuff in word It39s not ideal if you go to school Working in environments like Teams aren39t that great aswell I can39t create documents inside the app to share with group members ect It still lacks alot of functions Despite waiting for 15 year now it39s not ideal for me Great video thank you and have fun with the IPad We need folks to do a durability and a real world test like when a toddler sits and walks over it this happens when every new iPad comes out  every creator makes a quotthis will replace my Macquot video until iPadOS get better you are not replacing your Mac you are going to buy the iPad make a few youtube videos then return it Apple sheep being a programmer I think that I would never be able to switch to iPadbrBut for every other person I think that it will be possible pretty soon The reason for such a drop off in iPad sales was their durability They were futureproofed so much that there was little need to buy a new one every two or three years There is less reason to upgrade your iPad compared to a phone because they aren’t where your point and shoot camera resides I’ve just pulled the trigger on a new iPad Pro six years after buying the 2018 model Not because I wanted the latest and greatest but because I wanted to pass down this iPad which still works really well and get myself a new one that will keep me ahead of things for several years There is less need to purchase iPads when they just keep going Mine is primarily for drawing and design work which there is no substitute for in my book 3600 dollars Damn fuck thatbrbrYou said it it is obscenebrbrThis will face the same criticism as the  super thin macbook from back in the daybrbrApple instead of working on actual problems like the battery and the lack of ports instead they add features that aren’t necessary Why Because you have 18 Million subs  what a nice ad to watchbrThe iPad will never be a Laptop replacement in its form these days Yes the hardware specs are impressive and if its only about this its possible BUT since this thing still runs iPadOS  how are you gonna replace a desktop os with a tablet when the tablet still runs a quotlite osquotbrThe only thing these iPads lack is MacOS  To make a video 🤷 I gave up on the iPad when I was in college and I needed to load a website just to get “Not compatible with Mobile browsers” 😵… I’ll keep my M3 MB Air iPhone 14PM and just add the M2M3 iPad Air if the new iOS is worth the upgrade🤷🏾 1 because you already made that money back posting this video 2 you39re a multi millionaire 3 its a tax write off for your business so yeah you spent 36k bc its negligible I love watching movies so I prefer the S9 over this one This one is just garbage Few are for work Just take a PC if you are looking for something good for work When is the screen of the iPad going to look like the Samsung tablets Those things are elite If it can run premiere pro with the power of my pc I might consider jumping ship Both suck compared to Windows Laptop or  Handheld LMAO Obviously give the iPad the ability to run MacOS or Windows and you’d see pretty easily spank a majority of handhelds and laptops theramennoodler7950 that39s the whole point dude brIt39s like giving Z1 extreme the efficiency of M3 brYou can39t I have a smart bank card it refused to pass the payment when I try to buy some craps Saves me all the time So you39re now going from a 16quot screen to a 13quot screen eh brContradicts everything you39ve said in the past 🤣brCan39t take a guy seriously who39s using an Android Phone because of the fake AI and an Apple Watch with a secondary iPhone sadly like Marquees you39ve lost your way 😏 Apple editing tools are free or we should pay to use them Believe me no tablet deserve this price tag All the things he mentioned are justification that every tech company provide at the launch which to be honest never provide value for money I see the appeal I’m in art school in graphic design and I have a friend who categorically refuses to use a mac he’s fine with ipads tho He specialises in illustration and for him an ipad was game changing he drew like 3 times more and better The crazy expensive ipad from the video is the crazy maxed out one nobody needs that i agree but a 15002000€ ipad is completely acceptable Why  just look at the premium graphic tablets prices it is outrageous for just a “screened trackpad” and ipad is very similar in drawing capabilities does way more than juste being a graphic tablet and is cheaper its come to the point where apple is just like designer clothes people just buy it for the apple tag and to look rich there are so many tablets that are even better and below 1k dolalrs dadayoshiki Dont forget after 5 years when the battery is degraded you cant use the ipad work outside Unlike the macbook pro once the battery is dead you can still plugged it and use it as a worksation at home with multiple screens Not to mention most apps in ipad os are subscription base There are artists especially in the comics industry that only use iPads pro for their work And in their case the iPad is cheaper and better than professional drawing tablets leonardo3689 Nah Im an professinal artist as well I can tell for sure there are many professional artist have an ipad pro but they still prefer mac or pc because of photoshop you can observer your favorite artist such as loish they use ipad but not their primary tool because its limited \\u200bdadayoshikias an fellow artist half agree I agree on the fact that ipad  are crazy good at creative works but I don39t agree on the pricing The ram upgrade and storage upgrade prices are crazy 200 bucks just for going from 8 to 16 gb Where the natural price is just around 20 bucks It39s 10x more and those ram and storage don39t justify the crazy prices brbrApple should decrease the prices for their ram and storage and then I agree Samsung will come out with something better or just as good and it will have a fair price I really don39t understand the brand loyalty a lot of people have with Apple products it39s borderline cult behavior Samsung will come out with something better or just as good and it will have a fair price I really don39t understand the brand loyalty a lot of people have with Apple products it39s borderline cult behavior chadstinson9886 they already are super close to what ipad had in terms of hardware and pen but Samsung lacks in the software department We really need something like procreate on android which is affordable and one time payment like it Which we currently don39t have And apple knows this so they are going turbo with innovation and targeting artists with software seamlessly goes with their pencil brbrI would love to buy an android tablet which is on par with ipad for artists but we don39t have it now chadstinson9886 i don39t understand how you can39t understand a simple fact of a life Consumers are loyal to the products which they are comfortable with Your question is like quotwhy are you loyal to your wife if there are lots of beautiful women out therequot Because the guy feels comfortable with her and doesn39t have big issues If he feels uncomfortable or unhappy he just gets divorced There are people who quit using Apple devices or vice versa Just let the free market and consumer behavior decide on it Keep calm sethdavenport5813\\xa0 Making a lifetime commitment under law and whatever religion you have is a lot different than a phone company Brand loyalty on apples products is almost cultish and they bank on that fact and push the behavior sethdavenport5813\\xa0 also making a small comment on that fact isn39t a big deal and I39m as calm as a Hindu cow I just call it like I see it and if someone reads the comment and go quotyou know what he may be right I39ll try a different company and see how I like itquot then I have accomplished what I set out to do chadstinson9886 you really don39t understand Apple is not a baby company but a tech giant with 50 years history creating big trends in the industry They are not a quotphonequot company When you buy an Apple product you don39t only get a phone You get Apple Music Apple books Tablets Apple TV Apple computers Apple watch Home Pod and much more This is an ecosystem All these products work perfect together under IOS software Once you are in it it is hard to leave it away This is not because of cultish behavior but a choice of an amenity Calling it a cult is really nonsense Even sometimes ppl get divorce easily than getting rid of their apple  products The only iPad I find useful is the mini I bought one tried to use for class in the two weeks I had it I ended up using like twice before returning it It’s nice to have one but then again I can do anything an iPad can do on my laptop how muchyeah not a chance You can39t replace a laptop with RTX 4090 with a Ipad bruh I also want this please give it to me I live in Pakistan Please This is not M4 Because you are a consumer propagandist that pushes the corporate agenda to create more unrepairable technology that continues to violate the rights of workers consumers and everyone else inbetween Where was the device you are making this comment one made theramennoodler7950 You39re not making the point you think you are Manufactured in China proudly Used and repaired by me for years He tried his best to convince all to buy it But legend knows what to do 😅 Do a huawei pura 70 ultra review ipads are such a scambcoz even though u pay for a high end chip u get a locked version of it downgraded to loose a lot of its performance Still see no reason to change my 2018 pro IOS needs to change why no video on pixel 8a 😅 It is because you have a lot of money and will be getting some more from this video and not because of anything really new lol I  use my iPad instead of a tv Even tho I have a 85inch Disgusting Because deep down you know that purchasing this thing is not worthwhile so you have to try to convince yourself out of it with a 16minute video I fell for the same thing with the previous model After a year I feel I have some advice to give to potential buyers Keep in mind my perspective is that of somone who does content creation full time edits 23 7min 4k videos daily and rarely leaves home I also like having the latest most powerful devices even if they end up as paperweight in the endbrbr1 The ipad pro this one or earlier models will NOT replace your laptopbr2 The export times on the ultra chips can´t be beatenbr3 You will probably never use the pencil more than twice a month if that br4 The magic keyboard IS a must so always add that in when considering budget br5 It is a snappy piece of tech but the apps not even the pro ones don39t take full advantage of the chipbr7 You have to buy a different license for Davinci on the ipad and it often crashesbr6 I still use mine on an everyday basis however exclusively for media consumption youtube and crunchybr7 I ended up buying a macbook in the end brbrI feel the ipad pro only makes sense for people who for whatever reason can39t ownuse a laptop If you do video for a living you can get by but it will come with a lot of limitations which you39ll encounter more often that you39d like I was told this countless times but I didn39t listen because I love wasting money apparently if you want an ipad GET THE AIR It will end up working more than fine for the way you will inevitably end up using your ipad pro for video consumption and in case you want to work on it with photo and video editing someday you actually can I tried to go buy a new iPad then realized the only Apple product I can afford is apple juice… So 3 words You bought it There it is folks he made this video to get  to buy the 3600 ipad 😂 The iPad is just awesome but it’s like they build Disneyland in a prison brbrThe second you need to do any file management or device management there are walls and roadblocks everywhere There is a community devoted to work arounds but you eventually give up It’s just too painful brbrAnd you hate that you can’t have that amazing pencil pro and the touch capabilities dude buys kitchen appliances that have no business running on android then tries to claim he39s not usually like this Who cares about a thin iPad We all put them in cases so is just a

computer Apple won’t let it brbrYou are suffering from consumerism fueled fomo my friend But I guess you have to make content How do you buy phones for your personal use as a tech expert Why Because

as thin and has had a pen forever 😂  They39re acting like this is new Plus Samsung has Oled display Seriously I thought 4 minutes in quotdoes this guy even get the Ipad in this videoquotbrSkipped ahead and saw nope Turned it off \\u200blimbeboy7hahaha true bias much And about the magnetic keyboard huawei already had it \\u200b\\u200blimbeboy7I don39t think the Samsung tablet price is expensive though limbeboy7but they’re like really slow limbeboy7 Apple has double OLED display and we all know Apple comes later but does things marginally better zoelafa4813 did he really order it 🤔 \\u200b\\u200bcyclopgaragekeep telling yourself that Make Papa Tim proud swirlandtwirl5417 Apple released the Magic Keyboard 4 years ago 3 months earlier than Huawei limbeboy7 you samsung lot are always in apple conversations stating that samsung is better while nobody asked or said anything about samsung nobody wants to argue with y39all we all know that apple does things late but they do have the best products they could release a product 30 years late and still outsell samsung Watch0w1 im no brand slave I have Samsung as well as having owned many others like LG  HTC and so on in the past but I legit am explaining my phone experience cyclopgarage what the hell is double OLED is that some new nonsense apple marketing term If you mean DualLayerTandemOLED Honor was actually the first vendor to use that technology Just what I was saying Look again at all of his recent video on Apple gadgets Complete ads When it comes to reviewing any other device they become saints mexifry222he did buy it though c8ke78  slowing doing what alex190291 Yeah that39s what I meant but Apple does it better they come late to the party but they make a big bang It39s called content marketing It39s nothing new Crazy to think at one time he was on the good side of the force He is just becoming a fanboy more and more alexgreg152 when money isn’t an issue which it isn’t for him then Apple is the way to go wr2899 Lmao i already bought iphones and i just can39t stand them Plus you39re like completely wrong i could have all the money in the world i still wouldn39t go for any of Apple scams A Samsung s23 for example does everything that i need Why would i go for Apple and their scams  wr2899 If it39s about the money and want the most expensive go for a Samsung z flip more expensive than any Crapple When u think he have a MacBook Pro with 8TB 😂 Send it back We just gonna forget the windows surface exists Not to take away from the video but watching this reminded me of the Surface Pro series from Microsoft switching between laptop and tablet to have the best of both worlds I would say the difference is that Microsoft wanted the Surface to be a laptop first and a tablet second which made the tablet aspect of things clunky to use sometimes and the Microsoft store didn39t really have as much app support as the Android or Apple storebrbrIt is interesting to see these companies converging on a similar idea though I wouldn39t be surprised if in a few years Apple discontinued the Mac and just replaced it with this exact concept of 39dual functionality39 It would make financial sense as well it would save them money and they could charge more for it and any other additions to make a 39functional39 tablet Mac hybrid 39Cuz you are insane  Or money means nothing to you anymore all they do is worthless as long as they dont put macos on it It39s a glorified tablet No tablet is worth £2000 Website gt App here Apps can do too much in the background on a device Even on Apple When I see the price the only reason I’m happy about is having apple … stocks 😂 you pay 3600 they get 3000 real income My mom used to say ipaid to ipad Now i understand why That is insanely to much money for a Tablet tell me again how apple is not just stealing Trust me once you have a cellular iPad you39ll never buy another WiFi only model You39ll also curse Apple for not making a cellular enabled MacBook Pro The convenience is a game changer I had one tablet a Samsung back in 2017 and I don39t think I39ll ever get one again They39re great for leisure but I kept finding myself asking if it was worth it My laptops have always served me better chuck7415  Negativity about the iPad is so weird  No one tech product meets everyone39s needs of course  But the fact that Apple sells an average of 30 billion dollars worth of iPads per year it39s obvious there is an enormous market for the devices  By the way Google did an extremely poor job of taking advantage of the larger screens and early Android apps were just blown up phone apps  Apple did a great job and today dominate the sales of tablets bruxi78230 👍 why would anyone spend 2000 to 3600 dollars on an ipad when its just as expensive to buy a desktop that can do more Hell for 3600 dollars i can buy TWO MAC MINISbrAlso at no point in this video did anyone actually see you click the quotbuyquot button so in essence you didn39t spend anythingbrand if you are dumb enough to spend that much money on an ipad then Bless your heart  🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 double the price of a rtx 4090 lol I can buy a macbook pro for the same amount so what is the

behind this one Apple must of really paid you good money to get a over priced Netflix iPad Crazy money for a average iPad that you could actually buy a whole computer Because the screen is bigger that39s the exact reason You39ll realize when you get older and start needing to use reading glasses you39ll understand why you39ll want to use an iPad over an iPhone The shot of him using his toothbrush was completely unnecessary … quotSmall carsquot must be a hell of a lot cheaper in the UK In the US 3600 will get you a 20yearold Corolla with 250k on the odometer and the check engine light on You are encouraging corporate greed by even reviewing it No matter how you look at it it is stupidly overpriced How much did apple pay you My issue with the iPad ecosystem is cost vs durability The Magic Keyboard works great until it breaks after a year or two if you’re lucky and repair is pretty unrealistic with the copper tissue paper that makes up the wiring Impatiently waiting for the next Ultra chip Mac Studio If you asked iPad Pro owners what they want improved thinner and lighter likely don39t be high on that list  What would be a popular request would be better software

That toothbrush scene was wild lol You were quotIgladquotbrbrWow that was Linus level bad I will tell you why you spent 3600 on this tablet Because you have a tech channel and you consistently need new videos to upload Isn’t that enough reason to buy one Because with such a large audience those 3600 will be recovered in hours is not minutes brAfter that with every view its just pure profitbr😂😂 Using my 5th gen 129 with Shapr3d Just amazing machine No plans to switch to M4 M1 is still super powerful for all my needs I’m from Asia and I don’t understand you guys have GDP per capita like 50000 and still say it’s very expensive thing when it’s like 1k2k I thought the answer was quotbecause I39m a Muppetquot Because it39s the ultimate ipad and it39s SUPER COOL  VIRTUALLY A MACBOOK PRO BUY BUY BUY I39m wandering what your impressions will be because i was given a free iPad with the purchase of a web app 4 years ago and i was thoroughly disappointed too learn the ipad couldn39t even run the web app because apple only allows quotskinsquot of other web browsers on their tablets but the engine still uses Safari I tried using it for work but all the apps are stripped down and buggier versions of computer apps If you connect a keyboard to make it work a little better at that point you might as well have a laptop Ultimately because of the way Apple limits what is allowed on iOS the device ended up being nothing more than a decent way to consume media So I39ll put a cartoon on Netflix or YouTube for my kids when i need to distract them for a minute But i rarely use it myself guys did anyone know how long he has been talking his background is night time Ipad pro 12quot are the worst products because they still use ipad os They are a computer yet they are glorified phones Time for them to use macos otherwise I find them useless 3300 for a glorified phone which does not have any glamorous features other than recycled content is asinine You’ll be disappointed eventually mark my words And it still has Ipad OS lol Signed Ipad for a lucky sub 🎉 Love your show btw Much live 🫶 whats the name of the other table with ink screen It39s still a glorified bigger version of an iPhone No M chip of this world can save the iPad from being useless until Apple straight up puts MacOS or a derivative on itbrbrMacOS already can run iOS Apps they would maybe need to work a bit more on compatibility and that39s itbrbrMost people after a while of owning it will use it if even that as a media consumption machinebrbrIt39s also too big for a lot of iOS games and not all games have controller support so no the iPad is not the best of both worldsbrbrI39m sure there are UseCases where it would actually help someone out but that39s definitely a very niche user base Probably for pen dependant jobs it might deliver But I for example after graduation didn39t use the pen except to sign documents a few timesbrbriPad external display support is also crap Samsung with their Dex and Microsoft with their full WindowsOS on their Surface Pro devices are just better alternativesbrbrHeck with Microsoft you have a whole arsenal of games available to you With that kind of a budget you might get a Surface Pro device  a good eGPU and you can do whatever with itbrbrIf you really want an iPad get an older Pro version or get an Air to anyone looking for advice and having at least one braincell left to thinkbrbrKinda funny though how good the Apple marketing is People actually think it is a good idea to pay that amount of money for that useless thing Problem with tablet is their OS It39s fundamentally different than a laptop has So even if you have the same apps and computing power as on your laptop I cannot be as productive with a tablet as their OS forces a different workflow on me costing me timebrbrAlso for simple tasks like you have a file in the cloud let39s say a pdf I will make notes in this file using both devices You would think that would be no issue at all especially when I was using an apple laptop and I an iPad  with Google cloud though That stupid iPad kept saving new versions of the same file in the file system So everytime I had to use the newest file that had been created without me wanting it I wasn39t able to get that fixed  the pdf app on iPad OS always would download a local copy and not mutate the original in the cloudbrReally annoying especially if you use all apple productsbrbrSo tablets will most likely be entertainment devices for me in the near future That might be different in 5y though Who knowsbrbrEdit He points out the file system as it39s main flaw as well What a coincidence 😂 Any none Apple user will be laughing hard at this one🤣🤣 at this point people don39t buy apple product because it is worth it or not  is it just like buying a Gucci or Luis Vuitton shirt Brand  You didn39t spent that I wouldn39t afford even with credit Simple wordbrbrNo You should do a video about the Box AiR 33C It can do so much more than the remarkable And no subscription Nope Way too cheap for me Still not smart though… quotWhy I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4quot  So that you can make 10 times as much with this YouTube video That made me laugh😂 You’re the first tech reviewer who has pointed out the advantages of the iPad running iPadOS rather than MacOS whilst still considering it as a viable laptop replacement I now understand why Apple still keeps making the iPad Pro I shook my head and laughed when Steve Jobs first said it and I39m still shaking my head and laughing I could never consider an iPad as a computer replacement because what makes a computer a computer is the file system I guess for the people who don39t care about a file system then yes an iPad can replace a computer But for me a file system is essential mikemccormick6128Also if you’re a coder tablets serve no purpose Android phones have file system apps😅\\u200bmikemccormick6128 mikemccormick6128 iPad has a file system Has had one for a while now EyePodXcan be usable when combined with a cloud dev environment like codeserver Right so you need a computer to do coding on this device Wouldn39t it be easier to use that computer 😂 \\u200bkaloraifi mikemccormick6128The iPad has a file system that’s much more functional than you probably realize It’s not a desktop file system but it’s much closer now than it used to be I’ve pushed the limits of the iPad file system since 2015 and it’s improved greatly You39re buying it cos you will make 20 times the cost of it on this video Tell me I39m wrong When are you and MKBHD going to have a contest to see which of you can most quickly make a company shut down I get that this channel is for teenagers and not to be taken seriously but HOW THE FRICK is it possible that a channel with 18 million subscribers has such a horrible audio quality Damn Because you can Try to switch your Mac with the iPad Pro for 1 week😉 I can39t tell if this is a spoof or not who cares how thin it is I39m surprised you are not quotall inquot on the Apple ecosystem Where’s your Normal nice studio😭 u couldve bought a pc from nasa Am I the only one getting HUGE SPen vibes with the quotnewquot Apple Pencil Pro functionalities this is exactly why he is the goat bro made a video not even after 24 hours after the product launch The kid fine gonna be watching COCOMELON IN  ULTRA RETINA XDR DOUBLE OLED WITH SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM😆😆 Aaron doing a presentation to try to convince his wife to let him spend 36k on an iPad Definitely ipad is awesome ❤ lately i was thinking about high end smartphone priced as midrange laptop and possibly laptop replacement but i just couldn39t tell how until watching this video Lol some people want iPad to run on MacOS From the start There39s a reason MacOS is designed for the clamshell notebook devices and not for the devices with multitouch UI And there is a reason It39s an iPad and not the Mac Target consumer is a layman school college guy and even the working professionals who don39t prefer complexity of the Mac and want the straightforward UI of iPad And even if Apple design MacOS around multitouch it would only complex the device further which is not what apple likes to do In my humble opinion people demanding iPad to run Mac OS are simply lost and have no clue how Apple function i know a apple paid promotion when i see one 😂 And here we go again someone who never really used an iPad is trying to replace his MacBook This will end in disappointment within 1 month of using it because iPadOS is barely usable The iPad is good for just 3 things writing drawing readingmedia consumption everything else is a chore to do on it Hi great video Can you please mention the function of Office Apps Word Excel Powerpoint on iPad Because one of the biggest reasons I would get Macbook instead of iPad is exactly the poor function of IOS version of thembrThanks watched full video with 4 unskipble 20 second ad 🙂 you can dowload from the netflix on the laptop if you have the app You posted this on my birthday This is clickbait There is nothing that has changed much from the last iPad Pro from the perspective of replacing your laptop The problem with replacing your laptop is the software Until they update the software it won’t replace the laptop The software limits it every time apple release a product and saying quotthis is the most powerful device yetquot brPeople waiting 2040 to get  the quotmost powerful device  yetquot thinking they saved  20 IPAD modelsbrbrArun still saying the same thing for next 26 years🤣 And 3 x Samsung add came on hmm 😂 i was the toothbrush 🫠 and I wanted to make a video about this because it39ll pay for this iPad many many times over 😄 Why Because you can make content off of it and nake more money Easiest question ever bcz apple gave u a good discount and u knw u r gonna earn more than double or tripple than the amount u spent via making YT videos on the same product wym discount he got this for free 😂 jeskco LoL 100 disc  accessories for advertising deadass just buy a refurbish or used one cheaper and same shi How can anyone justify buying this  There39s no way it costs apple more than 700 from production to shipping  and how do you justify the limitations of IpadOS Ipad will never replace mac till the time it starts using  MacOS It’s because you have too much money bruh and you’re gonna make even more money with the videos about the tablet A tablet with PC processor and kindergarten OS Should I buy MacBook Pro or this  macbook pro definitely Hovering over the buy button with the urge to purchase based on peer pressure Just imagine Also it doesn39t replace eink writing Everything else is subpar iPad Pro “First OLED tablets with LTPO first OLED tablets with a tandem stack matte nanotexture display brightest and longest life OLEDs in tablets lightest and thinnest OLEDs tablets as well due to glass thinning and TFE” I see it the way you do I got it primarily for the display but I’m just a hobbyist so I didn’t want to invest in one of those oled gaming monitors just yet And it’s a great device for note taking and other mobile stuff I don’t need it to produce a lot because I have a specced out pc so having it supplement my work and play is appealing Also buy Samsung39s tablet with keyboard and compare them Since they are very similar in many aspects it and Dex is better than Center Stage it would be a very worthy comparison Illustrator here I love my iPad Pro I use it for drawing and that’s it Otherwise I agree phones can fill every need aside from drawing space Do an iPad battery test Those who actually need it can39t buy itbrThose who buy it doesn39t need it and use only a little Definitely going to wait and see what WWDC has in store in terms of software side of things before considering this As of right now it39s just a x4 as fast Netflix machine as my M2 iPad Pro how about the google pixel 8a because it should soon come out Love your perspective Apple people sighbrGood luck Hope it works out very well Nahhhhh iPad still can’t smoothly transfer big files from one OS to another Still a fancy tablet at best Imagine having a standardized port yet limiting transfer due to different file systems What I want to know is how games from capcom and ubisoft perform in this version of the ipad They started porting Resident 4 and 8 during the ip15 announcement and from what I heard it only runs on 720p I hope you include those when you release your experience with it 3000 and no gpu  now that’s a ripoff Because you can lol Today I basically understand why apple never done a touchscreen computer cuz the day they doing that the will kill iPad market… they making us a kind of phone with a computer chip… I’m ain’t buying that You make this so unbiased I feel you are honest Me Bruh 256GB is so muchbrArun quotImma 8TB kinda guyquot 4k8k recording takes crazy space and that too unedited once so it should be obvious 256gb isnt enough to download all the music I listen to 👎 Do you even realize how much cache gets built up while editing a video Bro needs a NAS blasiankxng🧢brIt’s way more than enough to download all the audiobooks I ever listened to no way it wouldn’t be enough for all the music you listen to Because now you39re using it as PClaptop now no longer as a phonetablet thetafritz9868 my songs currently take up 158GB and that39s only 34 of the songs I have favorited granted I have it set to download the highest nitrate lossless versions but still god forbid if I was a genshin impact player or any mobile game I39d probably have to buy a 512GB phone lol 256GB is nothing 256GB hard drive and 8GB RAM are the biggest criticism of entry macs t33mtech59 especially Mseries macbooks entrylevel m139s have dinky specs bnonupgradeableb  deliberately to trigger buyers to skip over them amp spend more  thats the main reason I39ve been on the fence about getting a macbook for last 3 yrs Mseries chips are way faster for video edits thetafritz9868 I think the comment bug just happened to me but basically I said 158GB of my phone is only 34 of my FAVORITED music so it could be worse I didn’t expect my comment to get so many like and replies thank you People With 64gb and still Have a lot of space🗿🗿 😂😂 These days they should make 512 as THE standard not 128 or 256 anymore The replies are saying that the 8tb storage is way better than 256gb storage I say that the 8tb storage has a lot of power All the feature you want from all apps download a ton of apps need a lot of speed and low latency Get the 8tb storage because it39s top of the line for tablets \\u200bmohdasim5450that39s the phones tablets laptops from the people who are intelligent \\u200bblasiankxng 256 Go x 1024 MoGo x 110 Momin x 60 minheour  153 600 hours of musica little bit to much 8TB is a jokebrbrEven my 18TB drive is not enough Waiting for the 30TB drives to come out this year for consumers \\u200bt33mtech59Macbooks don39t use hard drives anymorebrbrThey use Solid State DrivesbrbrLearn the difference Really true😂 t33mtech59 especially because macOS can brake when you dont leave at least 10 of the storage free and when it does your data is gone unless you have a backup of course t33mtech59It depends on what you want to use it for thetafritz9868I bought 256gb for my nephews and they use it for everything and it is more than enough I guess it depends on what you use it for Pixel 8a All companies are trying to please their shareholders by bumping up prices not gonna work 3600 dollars Shows the economy is actually crashing Buy the iPad and RDP into your Mac when you need to Problem solved  They just should make the Mackbook Pro touch screen but I get it they will lose  if the do Those detachable keyboards for ipads are crap only bad thing is you can’t pick it with one hand as easily and need to be carefull else the keyboard detaches but hey you have a very thin and light computer with touch screen and tablet mode so if they somehow could improve the magnetic hinge to make it super sturdy traditional laptops wouold probly cease to exist D …would need like a button you press so it detaches or soemthing Me and my sister having them 😮 You39re buying the brand and trying to justify the expense in order to get a dopamine boost But at the end of the day unless you have specific usecases in mind at the time of purchase it will likely not result in a positive experience beyond a diluted sense of exclusivity and participation in cult mentality It39s definitely cool listening to all of the technological advancements being made but dude This costs more than my laptop and my laptop has a 4070 graphics card 14th gen i9 and 2TB SSD Why does the tablet cost so much Because you didn39t 1 Because im a YTer who can monetize my ridiculous purchasebr2 🦗🦗 What game is that that you39re playing on the iPad You spent 3600 on an iPad because you’re a professional YouTuber and you need people to watch your videos… Because you have the money to do so hahaha what a stupid waste of money Wow thats crazy for something with terrible software  Ipads didnt need more power or thinner It needs real software after like a decade of asking 😂🤦🏿\\u200d♂️ 💪 Unlike other videos this one looked like a paid promotion video rather than a review 3600 MAN I’m laughing because I had a iPad Pro Mac for 1800 and I sold it for 250 on a pawn shop I hovered too but as a performing musician and for my Macbook Pro and Mac Mini to be parked I need the software to be there  If they can coax or help port Mac apps and Audio Units from third party developers to iOS I39ll happily use an iPad but for me not yet I tried to replace my laptop with an iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard a few years ago and it was an awful experience The OS alone holds the iPad back You just can’t do on a tablet what you can do on a laptop Hard to justify the price i am sure apple is very happy with the title sponsored For decades now I have searched for that elusive onedevicetorulethemall and after spending thousands of dollars on various quothybridquot devices I have come to the conclusion that no such device will ever exist There will always be a tradeoff to a dedicated laptop tablet and phone and ultimately if your workflow requires all 3 then invest in good devices in each class Trust me the jackofalltradesmasterofnone hybrid device will always end up being a subpar experience Hey Arun if you don39t want that remarkable tablet i will gladly take it Actually Apple wants to replace laptops with tablet so they can charge keyboards for extra 1000 price 😂😂😂😂😂 a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a Been using my 2020 iPad pro and been wishing and longing to see it able to support programming amp coding Whats the point of having best specs but unutilized a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt42042a editor did Arun dirty ☠️☠️😵\\u200d💫 🤣 👀☠️😲💀 I tried two times using only an iPad Pro as a full replacement and both times I quit after a few weeks iPadOS doesn39t cut it never will They won39t put MacOS we all know that and therefore lies the biggest problem If this thing had MacOS I39d buy it right now This is really really dumb can you make a video explaining quantum data Who cares bro apple products are for dummies I would prefer a powerful pc than a fricking tablet that can be breaked easily this is why phone reviewers should stick to phones waste of money for something that after 10 mins of use becomes an m1 chip and still has the shitty ios tablet software and this is why you don39t buy the newest shiny thing kids Bro uses a remarkable and is saying that he won39t even look at Samsung tablet cause of their phone chips cause you39ll be able to do so much more on a laptop chip with zero cooling How did I missed the rick rollbrcan someone tell me were it was u can get smart 4k tv and a gaming pc with price paired up with a phone xd I think I39m at the exact same point as you when it comes to Ipad I need something better than a laptop and Ipad Pro fits the requirementbrThat being said I honestly think that powerhouse M4 chip will remain under utilized because of ipad OS Also the thinner body  Smaller battery if Apple claims that its the same battery lifebrit only mean the M4 is able to achieve more with less power that immediately should be understood as bottleneck that apple has implanted over the weak OS Why Because you’re insanely rich and spending 3600 is nothing to you 😂 This iPad is my wedding budget 😊 Yep WHAHAHA Then maybe you should opt  for the Ipad \\u200bunicornharry7995 you must be have a spending problem iPads don’t argue back RobsRemixesiPads can’t wash the dishes Until then I will stick to woman \\u200bRobsRemixes keep your personal problems to yourself people can argue back😱 lol marriage ain’t worth it in 2024 rather invest that money zeusx6479 where \\u200bzeusx6479 Ikr also why should I waste money on rent I could also cut costs on food I could sell everything I have and invest that shit I will now go sell this device and then sell my organs The OS that39s the problem Okay but lots of iPad apps are still just iPhone apps that you have to zoom into Yes iPad has a ton of apps and it’s not nearly as bad as it used to be But some apps still are awful on iPad Because you’re a millionaire nothing to be ashamed of Lol BRO THATS NOT HOW U USE TOOTH BRUSH Software Development I don39t think an iPad can do at workflow Why should this be the year of switch from MacBook to iPad 1 cm smaller and 100 gr less weight Or is it just the better screen Almost every reason to switch could have been mentioned for the last iPad Pro Finally an iPad worth upgrading from my 129” 2020 iPad Pro which I have been using as my primary device since then Four years out of any tech these days is a win in my book Since my Magic Keyboard and Pencil is four years old I don’t feel so bad about having to upgrade They both have just enough updates that make them worth it My tradein value just covers that cost Can’t justify the 1T or 2T for my use though 512K keeps it in a decent price range for a 4 year shelf life Thanks for the convincing review The system should be taken into account MacBook doesn39t support NTFS on default But it can read and write on external devices with other softwares brThe place where my files stored are optional on MacBook But this cannot be done on iPadOS That means 2TB model is useless for the most people Yeah my guy you are reaching on this one Stop the nonsense there39s no way I39m paying over 3k for an iPad All the points you made are frivolous and one dimension The video starts at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt240400a I just grabbed a ruler and my Ipad M1 Pro and it39s 51MM so what the hell is going on TLDRbrYour episodes are becomming more like software quotBloadwarevideosquot now Get to the point man Yeah problem is iPadOS If Apple doesn39t do anythng besides quotAI AI AIquot for iPadOS then no This thing isn39t even REMOTELY capable of replacing your MacBook regardless of hardware Can you compare the Tab S9 ultra with this It39s great but I do really dislike installing so many apps for each different services you end up with over a hundred different apps sometimes for things you only use very occasionally bruh tablets have done this a long time ago I actually use the iPad Pro for work and I hate how limited it is by its OS Some apps work fine but the ones importatnt to me MS Office Google Meet and such are mostly nerfed versions with significantly limited functionality and bizzare compatibility issuesbrMore processing power is literally the last thing I need I hope this year39s iPadOS brings something new to the table because I39m definitely not buying a MacBook just to handle professional text editing wow a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a that got me off guard 💀💀 An Ipad pro creates the illusion of productivity and at the end is just a big phone when you are at home Even taking notes with the pencil is a terrible experience I have the M2 and i cant justify the price At least the 3600 iPad has a better battery life than 2 hours and doesn39t physically hurt to use after an hour The Best IPad case Is the Chesonia Case It has a full HDMI port and 2 USB 20 ports and a head phone jack It has a usb c port but that is only for charging  It has full RGB black light keyboard and a supports Apple Pencil charging and a slot to put it when you close the screen brbrI’ve gotten rid of my 2017 MacBook Pro and started using my 2021 iPad Pro and found an app equivalent on iPad for every desktop app i use Including replacement for iTunes video editingconversion  application coding etc so for my use cases my iPad is a computer There is not a reasonable justification on why you would do such a thing It39s your money you can do whatever you want just wanted to let you know that you are part of the problem since you clearly support extreme overpricing and the criminal business practices of Apple and other equivalent companies  And I know you dont careIf only consumers had brain iPadOS is still just too limiting for laptop duty imo I tried writing with Google Docs and a browser in split screen but when I wanted to juggle a third and fourth app it just got far too clunky I was missing my MacBook in minutes Well I would not pay 3600 USD close to 5000 CAD for a laptop or a desktop let alone a tablet  It is insane We need MacOS to merge with iPadOS A MacPadOS Adobe needs to allow all their desktop applications on iPad Dude don39t talk so good about the new iPad The only new thing is the front camera It has the same software that can39t do more than other tablets I don39t know why these YouTubers give so much relevance to small things that are the same as the last three years39 iPad Pro At least give an honest review  Sometimes I believe that Apple really pay them to talk and I39m not surprised that they do that Prode to watch in ipad Day 3 of asking Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop Answer quotBecause you39re rich ishquot Let39s face it This video more than paid for it and if UK taxes work like US It39s a writeoff apple did the right thing by removing the ultrawide cam it wasn39t necessary or made any sense in the first place Intersting for an artist on the go I am 50 years old I have my mbp and pen and paper This guy is trying too hard to make me waste my money on something nobody needs a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt367607a barrel roll is for people like me Graphic Designers… trust me… I NEED this Lol your just talking about getting locked in in the entire video I39ll stick with a real laptop with lots of ports and not glued or solders together If iPads were to introduce cellular they’ll simply use iPhone’s cell plan right The only problem is the calculator  I already tried with the ipad pro experience Until it died and apple left me stranded Lost all my data Never again Who the heck stil buys a tablet in 2024 😮 Uh oh apple didn39t mention battery life using dual led display is bound to consume more power quotWhy I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4quot because you can make the money back easily by publishing this video because you39re rich How about just spending 600 on an ipad air Now everybody will literally Pre order it 😂 Just like me justifying the purchase before buying tech that I might not use as much as I thought 😅 because you like to be locked under AppStore Hear me out NO DEVICE should be that expensive now everybody will literally pre order it 😂 Man clearly never had to use Excel on iPad 🤦\\u200d♂️ the early part of this video made me nostalgic lol i never even had a nexus 7 or nexus 10 but i wanted one because they looked so cool and way more fun than a phone for some things my sister had a galaxy tablet that i loved playing plague inc on I’m agreeing with your points but my bank account doesn’t and as many people are my bank account dictates my actions This terrible video is one of three thingsbr○ Paid by Apple to make a 16 minute ad and didn39t disclose the sponsorshipbr○ Made a 16 minute Apple ad for freebr○ Blatantly trying to write off an iPad purchase as a productionbusiness expense Because you have a good bank account 😂 I would bet that if he actually dropped his Macbook for an iPad he would run into the software limitations of final cut and audio production really quick They been doing this for ages cash grabbing using their quotpowerful chipquot but not allowing users to use it39s full potential They even change the sizes just to force you to buy their new accessories Think before you buy quotWhy I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4quot  Because you have over 185 millions subscribers many of whom are interested in mobile devices Just a guess A lot of Call of dutyMobileWarzone mobile content creators are going to buy this to destroy smartphone players😅 The only pros that are going to benefit from ipad pro are the graphic designers because of the new apple pencil At the end of the day is a tablet And 90 of things you do in tablets laptops or PCs can do it 100 times better Trust me Lenovo tab p12 is the same but it39s android and it39s 300 and not only this there are tons of nice big screen tablets on the market for affordable prices br so why waste money for a brand  I almost replaced my laptop with a Galaxy Tab S7 FE I even code on my tablet it39s crazy to know that apple are now paying youtubers to promote their products Not having the ability to install custom software not coming from the app store will always make me prefer MacOS over iPadOS As a developer the iPad simply can39t do what I need due to software limitations quotThe World39s biggest Hypocritequot sent me dead ☠💀 I really dont understand the need to buy an ipad for 3600 he could have bought 2 touchscreen oled laptops with crazy gpus simply not worth it External display support still sucks brStill iPadOS brPretty package but still an iPad Now the question is what do I do with my Macbook Air I just got for Christmas Oh My This is a 16 minute cope for the homie It39s ok though do your thing He39s F up Hes still in iPhone 6 era Storage isn39t my issue external is working for me and there are various NAS options But the inability to run Xcode on iPad is my limiting factor brbrSo Apple still is losing double on a power user like me Instead of getting the latest or a second year newer replacement I39m keeping my MacBook Pro and iPads much longer If I can39t get what I want then I39ll just wait until the pain point is enough where I upgrade It39s 100 inexcusable that apple doesn39t have Xcode on iPad especially considering they sell a keyboard with a trackpad and the iPad Air makes 100 no sense at all not worth it I39m really curious about the bactualb use case here  like what do you actually do I see ads of people holding it with one hand and editing photos with another  there are literally 0 actual photographers who has a workflow like that and not expect to starve to death Can the iPad Pro connect to more than 1 screen No matter what hardware is underneath it iPadOS is still a limited tablet OS The thinness is cool and all but who complained that the current iPads are too thick For the amount of money for the iPad Pro if you are actually needing to do a lot of work might as well get a laptop with an OS that39s not nearly as limiting as the one iPad has a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt432712a what is that game the irony of this amazing exciting review is that my main takeaway is how much I want one of those remarkable tablets Same here all the specs are useless as u can use the capabilities of the ipad to the fullest get an ipad with an M1 chip and u wont notice the diffrence \\u200busamashehab8138 yep this was my main takeaway all of this has been possible from the moment iPads started using Mac chips now it39s just a tiny bit faster and as long as iPad OS doesn39t get better like a normal pc most of the speed improvement is pointless unless you do a lot of hardware intensive work just get an older M1 chip iPad I don39t get where the quotironyquot is is my brain not working properly or are people just saying quotironyquot with a new meaning now da4127 I was definitely using the standard definition of quotironyquot The irony being that this video is promoting a new tablet which is supposedly so amazing that it might replace Arun39s MacBook AND his ReMarkable tablet yet the result of the whole pitch was making me want to buy the ReMarkable tablet instead We are now in the domain of luxury Rich people buy cars that look nice and are fast but are a pain when parking or shoppingbrbrThese iPads are the same they offer some advantages you don39t really need and come with so many disadvantages brbrJust buy a normal

the websites I have some control over what data I hand over rather than give significantly more access to my device The best ipad ever Insane cope Because you can Unfortunately I am not weathy enougth Love the video Just fyi I’ve now had to subscribe to your channel which I’ve followed for over 3 years for the 3rd time  Something keeps unsubscribing me Bad YouTube 😂 I have a Samsung tablet and I gotta say that thing gets so much use  I used to not really care about tablets in more recent years but I can call text watch media and use it for laptop stuff  I do think tablets can be very useful but should they cost so much Would you pay 3000 for one I have a gazillion laptops and tablets I initially got tablets because I thought it was ridiculous that I should be quotforcedquot by companies and governments to do important stuff on the phone39s 6 inches and forced we are as phones are deemed safer than laptops from viruses etc by many higher powers There39s so little you can comfortably do on the tablet versus a laptop and for sanity39s sake if we limit the discussion to Apple devices there39s so little that can detract from the nice package that the M1 Air was or the 15 inch M3 Air Got to be said if you can afford one you can probably afford the other so over the long run you39ll either end up with a wardrobe full of shoes like many females or boxes full of semiexpired electronics  DavidFrankland No that39s why he has a Samsung which already comes with the pen included Ridiculous price for a tablet My 12quot S7tablet has more features and it39s been around for years it39s funny how many more slow people are in the comments on Apple products vs anything else What game was that shown in the vid I own an ipad pro I love it But i use it less than I thought It is just an overpriced tablet I wish I could do more That sweater is gawjus I’ve recently changed my laptop for a tablet I’m a teacher and the touchscreen makes my work much faster to be done along with the fact that it’s more portable when I’m walking around the classroom talking to the kids That been said all my external keyboards when connected to iPadOS don’t work with Google’s services on the Web and the app for the iPad is more limited than the online version so now I can’t work with it Luckily the school uses an Android tablet and the keyboard works just fine Looking forward to selling my iPad and getting a Samsung tablet instead Title should have been quotSponsored by Apple though this piece is actually shitquot Us though Apple fully speced is 3077 just to let y’all know it’s not that bad lol This iPad is screaming from Applebuy it as we can39t figure out what else can be done on this tablet Simple because you have the money Easy 😊 Because you39re a tech YouTuber making videos about new tech duh i like how we watched the day go by 🤣 unless they revamp ipadOS the best it can be is for artist to draw on it Probably right up there with Apple Vision in the worst purchase ever category It39s a waste of money If you have money to waste then buy it else give it a big dose of swerve My money is on the new Snapdragon chips  Windows Tablets In practical use even a Surface tablet with M2 performanceBattery Life would still grossly outweigh the new Ipad M4 running IpadOS Excellent video‼Just some friendly advice  Please try to make a video every 4 days instead of 2 quick videos in 2 days then we don39t have to wait a week or 2 for the next video😉🌠 Oh yeahby the way 3600 for a iPad is ridiculous I would rather want a cheaper laptop Imagine spending money on Apple I still prefer desktop OS in tablet form sorry but its a rich person talking rich problems with rich solutions 0 real world aplication Instead of paying for TB of storage to get the nano screen option just buy the paperlike screen protector and save yourself a boatload of money That tablet is more expensive than my rtx 3080 and i9 laptop It39s a bit sad to see Mrwhosetheboss slowly becoming an apple fanboy It39s no way you can justify spending this much money on a tab which can barely do things a pc do unless you are the 01 of the people who do very specific stuffs So unless Apple gives the iPad Pros the capability of a MacOs this doesn39t make any sense I own an iPad pro 11 inch and I regret buying it It39s a great powerhouse but it39s sad to see that you can do so less stuffs with it Because Apple pays you mate  I need to be a YouTuber content creator lol then do a speed test ipad pro m4 versus the same price on PC 3600 This is the best argument I39ve seen yet to justify the crazy cost of these things but I don39t think I39m convincedbrbrI have been saying for 6 months quotwhen the new OLED iPads come out I39m going to buy onequot  I am currently using a 2020 iPad Pro with a partially cracked screenbrbrBut when I configured what I wanted 13quot 512GB wifionly it came out to 1500 add the new pencil and I39m paying gt1600  Is my life really going to change that much versus my current iPadbrbrWhen I ditched my PC last year and bought a Mac Studio and when I ditched my old RAZER laptop and bought a Macbook Air those purchases were life changing and I do not regret one penny of the cost  This one seems a lot more borderline Nah people use their pc with a 4090 to watch youtube more than they game on it 3600 equals 1000bdbrIt costs here 450bd Oh yea macbook is 500bd Day 2 of asking for some used review gadgets to convert into a funding for prosthetics Need one comparison video of m4 IPad Pro with Samsung s9 tab ultra Lol you can thank gamers for the popularity of these Why God damn My whole Gaming PC was only CAD 230873 I might get the new iPad Air 2024 though Hey can you buy the pixel 8a the new phone made by Google pls Because you want views The issue with tablets is they only run iOS Sometimes for a lot of programs and functionality you need the full blown OS Not a mobile OS As such I find it impossible to justify personally spending that kind of money on a tablet device regardless of use case It just lacks the fundamentals I39m surprised this video is being made in 2024 20192020 was the period where iPad Pros really took off on the performance and portability side I bought one  the OS and consistent limitations of apps is the system39s fatal flaw It shouldn39t be MacOS but its functionality has to be much closer to it to make the added cost worth it I still think this is primarily a creative39s tool which can occasionally  but maddeningly inconsistently   replace a laptop39s productivity functions dude u can’t justify that price tag as much as like apple products Bro wanted to justify buying an ipad i have m1 ipad and i love it His life is so posh he actually convinced himself he needs it for a very specific situation lol Btw  Nano Coating you WILL regret Mark my words What about you are going to make I phone I39m shocked that this channel has as many subs as Good Mythical Morning It39s bewildering cos u rich lor thats why or silly bro didn39t account for taxes 💀 No taxes after sales in UK price you pay is as advertised georgeharrison2795 WHAT that is so wild I am canadian and have 27 sales tax 💀 NethanielMCIn the UK the tax is already added into the price right before purchase… so it looks like you are not paying any tax but they pay around 20 Thank you so much for spending 3600 of your hard earned money so we can see just what the top end ipad can do That39s quite a sacrifice Bruh the title shocked me so much that I had to comment… I did not know this new iPad costed THIS much ☠️☠️☠️ this costs more than what I paid for my M1 Max 14” Listening to you talk is so exhaustingLoL sorry Another boring Apple product I just wish I could have mac OS on the ipad Unthinkable this can go up to 3600 lmaoo wtf 😂 bought the base pro myself though excited for it First iPad I’ll own since the first mini 💀 I tried making the switch but iPad OS is the limitation Those you browse the web email etc it’s a better solution aside from the clunky file management systembrbrBut working on the web in digital marketing and development it’s still not there Mazel tov on the wedding Imagine spending a pc worth of money on a tablet just to find a kid watching yt kids on it Most powerful Youtube and Netflix machine Bro you did not even buyed the tablet Can you imagine spending the same amount of a laptop for a tablet only to get a cover that becomes a keyboard just because you want to use a pen on the screen  yes 3k please 🤯 Tim cook wow😮😮brConsumer aaaoo😨😨 I have Lenovo yoga laptop it39s pretty fun to use as tablet in windows games I can use screen instead of mouse in games such as slay the spire I really like iPhone 12 pro max but if I can39t afford one please buy me an iPhone 12 pro max It will be a big help I don39t have a phone to do my work in university Please buy a big help😢😢 Shill  for apple put a keyboard on it  and call it a computer Key deal breaker for me is definitely operating system Can39t run

update i no longer able to use my ipad pro as a drawing tablet I39d complain it to the Apple store and their sales just told me to buy a new one 🙄 I feel like fallen into their planned obsolescene agenda I39ll not buy into it my Chinamade xppen last longer than my ipad pro 😡 xppen  died after 9 years due to wear and physical drop ipad pro not working due to fking OS update 2 months b4 new

softwares etcbrAll in onebrI mean yeah it can do it too but on a much smaller screenbrdosent this just target some super niche audience  brhow do they manage to stay profitable on this device  Im guessing that Apple will move iPadOS closer to MacOS this summer with enough puffer to not replace the MacBook Air’s Especially this new generation of iPad‘s but even the last two are so ridiculously overpowered it just doesn’t make any sense to run them on the same system as the baseline iPad So Can we talk about how Microsoft Surface was essentially doing what Apple is trying to do with an iPad right now The only key difference is that Apple is trying to make a mobile OS work as a Desktop one while the Surface always were using a full Windows OS It maxes out at £2599 Totally nailed it for me Exactly all the points I was thinking about spoken out loud Another point worth mentioning For folks who39s workplace has moved onto virtual desktop ie Citrix the Citrix iPad app pretty much allows you to have a Windows PC on your iPad  how sick is that Of course you39d spend so much on the iPad If not you then who It39s only designed for people like you and people who want to flex Not for your audience what the sketchbook name Bro is mrbeast buying everything you talk too much bro I lost patience 🤣 Yeah thats cool but where39s the calculator 😅 totally useless video You complicating simpler stuff A comparison is simpler but your divig into quotyourquot problems for the comparison and review I would like to ask you why you39re reviewing only the apple environment products It seems clear to me you39ve made up your mind already for iPad and just clearly compromising most stuff for quotyourquot iPad Neither the video review comparison is absolutely biased Anyone else watching this

iPads at the end of the day I don’t think Apple would allow iPads to use powerful software even though the tablet is capable of running them I wished it had a MagSafe connection like the iPhones it is super useful and convenient Not sure how they could efficiently do it on a such big device but I really hope we see more wireless charging going forward Because you39re wealthy lt iPads Pro MacBooks

worst investment ever just buy less expensive windows laptop i thought you are dead 8tb 🌝 MrWhosetheAppleFanboi Chicken nugget Well done Since the iPad Pro was introduced this is the BEST review about that product Everyone else enthusiastically repeats the advantages of the hardware quota modular MacBook Air with a stylus and touchscreen and the latest M chip for laptopsquot incorrectly called quotiPad Proquot and wrongly equipped with iPhone software but no one mentions the biggest problem THERE IS NO SOFTWARE FOR THE IPAD PRO But there is a price for a laptop The iPad Pro product is not an attempt by Apple to offer consumers a topnotch product and experience during use but rather to test their unintelligence Any user who has logged in with an iPad Pro and has not logged out after 4 weeks of use is probably recorded by Tim Cook as an irreparable zombie who cannot be helped and is not worth Apple39s effort to save and take with them when the asteroid that will destroy the planet comes a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt524844a I think the screen is not fingerprint resistant You only buy an ipad for that money simply because you have that money and you can Its a tablet Its not worth 3000 Idk what he’s yapping about iPads aren’t replacing pcs both have different features and needs If you put touch on the MacBooks and make them 180 degree foldable they gonna replace iPads in an instant There is no need for an iPad other than its touchscreen that is why Apple didn’t made touch laptop to this day this is exactly how I convince myself when I am going to buy something expensive quotuse their app than direct me to their websitequotbrbrThat depends eh Some services are exclusively app based for no good reason even though their frontend is web based A few apps Fine 10 20 How many dedicated apps do you want on your phonebrbrAs for the iPad sure it39s shiny and pretty and stupidly fast but so have they all since the M1 The problem is that very very few apps take advantage of that and the operating system actively prevents a lot of possibilities Because you rich Assuming it39s your own money you spent you39ve gotta be mental Very convincing video Already working on getting one Im just 3600 short rn The video would make sense if it cost 500 ronald3836 You CAN buy an iPad for 500 or even less Lowkey Bro you gotta change your microphone Answering

must too Except that the current iPad Pro has the exact same level of brightness mikemccormick6128 but I have the 2018 11 inch pro so an improvement over that iPads are good for gaming and drawing The main reason most people buying them is for drawing And the people who just want to watch YouTube and Netflix they can buy cheaper models Preordered the 11inch Can’t wait my man bought the tablet

iPad would have VSCode I would move on using ipad instead of laptoppc Ipad needs Mac OS sure i will try to make you I Glad 😂😂 Honestly the only reason to get an iPad Pro is for the Apple Pencil but there’s no reason to get the m4 iPad Pro it’s just to much performance I understand there’s apps like zbrush but why not get a MacBook for that Stage Manager still seems an idea that39ll lower your productivity Apple have the opportunity at this WWDC to bring macOS to iPad Pro M4 and make this device skyrocket in sales and have an actual meaningful usebrMake it something like DeX by Samsung but the Apple way Have an icon that you can switch simultaneasly between iPadOS and macOS because the hardware is there the only real work they have to do is to make macOS touchscreen friendly We all know they have enough resources to do that so if they don39t they are doing it on purpose So two things I feel like weren39t conveyed properly First iPad OS bis notb MacOS You literally bcannotb do many things on the iPad that you could do with a full operating system If you39re locked in the Apple ecosystem and only need to use the few apps Apple provides for the iPad then sure it could replace a MacBook in that narrow use casebrbrSecond thing is app developers generally treat tablet like the unwanted stepchild The bworstb version of most apps shared between phone tablet or desktop will be the tablet version assuming a tablet version even exists often it will just be a badly stretched phone version It39s the smallest marketshare so the lowest priority to get right at least u get 40  bucks

aboutbrbra hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt260420a Wow the dude discovered how function and quick keys works But you did not buy it did you TLDR For clicks Bold of you to think Apple will let you replace the macbook with a tablet Goodluck with that maybe by year 2060 The ipad power is overwhelming the ipad system and apps are underwhelming Ipads are good to consume videos music storing sheet music and take notes My 2014 macbook pro from 2014 still beats any ipad for making music for me due to lack of support for vsts and AU like NI kontaktEZ drummer and the pletora of effect plugs I have For writing scientific papers an ipad is hopeless due to similar lack of apps supporting my field This area is off course also dominated by microsoft programs and templates designed for those I can still write those papers on a macbook pro from 2014 using the same software as efficent…… Damn only cost me 2500 usd in the USA for the 2 tb model Because you are a aron What was that 3D design

suspect Apple will merge the two systems together and have a macOS experience for work with mouse and trackpad connected and a tablet mode for entertainmentrelax time The cringe of super rich youtubers pretending to complain about price quotWe have an app for thatquot Sure and if it works on my old mobile phone it gets updated and will not We run Windows 0S for around 10 years and programmes are likely to run on previous versions of Windows and the next version Android and iOS apps get fixed to shorter update runs of Android A device gets only one update more on iPhones and then it is fixed So having an app comes with quothow long will it be before I need to upgrade my phonequot But that is not the only issue The latest operating system might not allow an older app to run  You app enabled device then needs an old phone to still use it As much as it works for you which is great personally I am with MKBH more power thinner still not a labtop releasement yet  Wishing you beautiful wedding Why you spent that much Ofcourse for clout I like that the thing is so expensive that the guy had to make a video talking about buying it before even receiving the actual thing

iPads is the option to Dual Boot between iPadOS and MacOS There is no technical reason why this can39t be done it is simply a decision Apple has made If I had the option to run MacOS on an iPad for

last year’s ipad pro Because you39re a APPLE salesman  like the rest of your western colleagues 2 words Surface Pro All of this has been done for YEARS But like all things Apple imitate not innovate

guess a much cheaper iPad can do all the work that the expensive can do I love the idea of this thing I wish I had a use for it  The author39s 4090 I agree Ipad apps are easier to use than their pc

YouTubers help Dear Apple to answer the Question What is a Computer  Answer It is an IPad which has Apples version of Samsung DEX featured in the OS😅 This is the answer I think you are still looking for and I think will satisfy all iPad users  I mean Samsung has it and the Microsoft surface has this same feature now So what are you waiting for… Ow and if apple is able to pull this off I think a lot of buyers will choose the iPad over the MacBook Air as their first device in the Ecosystem Ow pricing…😅😅😅😅😅 what about m3  did it jumep over m3 or what I HATE when a product tells me to use their app Not everything needs an app Most are completely unnecessary quotWhy I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4quot quotbecause I39m no smart guyquot While every other YouTuber is calling the new iPad for what it is  a joke  Arun here an Apple fanboy is coming in to rescue this obsolete brand from losing more sales than they already have Objectively speaking Samsung tablets are way more useful and don39t cost an arm and a leg Aaron singlehandley funding the economy Are apples prices justified in the year 2024 Because of the hype I did buy ipad pro 11 1st gen back in 2019 only to be used as a streaming device on my dining table when the family eats 😂 I Wish That This new ipad pro Had Dynamic Island And it might be worth it Ithink the best thing to buy is the 999 11 inch one cuz if ur not a

don’t recommend you to buy MacBook and iPad you waste your money the reviews are fake laptop for use  is only windows   Much better in reality Macs are a pc replacement to use pc apps on the go Ipad

video on this Apple knows that if they put any price tag people will still buy it Even if the product is actually worth 14th of its value Biggest issue is it is still just IPad OS not full IOS

laugh at every buyer in the comments Why I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4  answer cuz you are paid youtuber The only way I found that I can use an iPad successfully to replace my laptop is to stick to using Safari browser Google apps do not work as well as their browser versions For instance this browser version of Safari allows me to export a single page from a spreadsheet as a PDF This is not

dude The price is ridiculous and you are defending not just an awful company but justifying consumerism and garbage products He biggest concern about iPad or IpadOS is Often using a single performance

photoshopbrUnitybrbrThese two apps can39t find it on IPAD My ipad has completely replaces my tv I can’t imagine not having a tablet Man i really wanna order one of these lol just debating if the 1tb is worth it for the additional core Perfect for rich ipad kids With the current iPadOS there is nothing exciting about these iPads and they will still be terrible laptops replacements for most people I39ve tried many times to go iPad only so I39m completely on board with the idea but in real life it39s frustrating as hell Mobile apps are much worse than desktop apps  take basic stuff like Google Docs or MS Office or Lightroom it39s just worse to use Yes editing photos on an iPad is nice and intuitive sometimes but anyhting with file managment etc is a nightmare No matter how much Apple spends in advertising through YouTubers to make the iPad feel like Macbook without making any core changing the outcome will be the same iPad sucks Apple to you want an advice free of charge iPad and Macbook nowadays have the same chip so there is no point of making two products with the quotsamequot specs but with different OSs and trying to make an iPad to feel like a laptop Just create a MacBook with these beautiful chip you39ve made with a detachable keyboard and Mac OS installed and voilà You have the perfect Laptop iPad and you stop putting so much effort on a laptop like iPad how much did this guy get paid by apple …and why you shouldn’t That should be the title The quotI can neither confirm nor denyquot had me pause😂 Review ❌️ Ad ✅️   Apple can consider fewer events now For the storage question you can have an external m2 ssd bay where you put any SSD you want in it I have a 1TB drive with me like this so you can easily have a 4TB with you at all times And because its external you can connect it with USBC cable to a phone as well I have the 129 m1… it really is just a big iPhone… lol I like apple products but remember apple will do anything to grab you as app store user They

there is nothing I throw at it that it could not do well but I still finding myself wanting that efficiency of MacOSbrbrHopefully that will drastically improve with iPadOS 18 later this year It39s nice  but I have zero interest in having a tablet in my life  Plus apple is a greedy company I now can comfortably say that this time Apple has copied samsung It39s more expensive than the 77in samsung s90c OLED TV What pullover are you wearing lt3 I still have the ipad 11 inch m1 chip and will never upgrade maybe ill do that when m5 or m6 chips will introduce im happy with my ipad always like thee pencil for art and very useful for editing Ooohhh i know why you spent 3600 on the new iPad Because for every video you make at least 30000 per million views Yea that39s probably why Since you haven’t used an iPad in a while I’m going to burst your bubble…sorry but you will miss your MacBook As soon as you try to do things MacOS specific and there are many of them you’ll be reaching for that MacBook Trust me I’ve tried the last few versions of iPadOS and it just isn’t there yet I love my iPad Pro but it is definitely a complement to my MacBook not a replacement no matter how lite and screen type the iPad is I do have an iPad but recently just switched to mac as the ipad wasn39t able to run unity and program web site So you dindt buy it Haha so apple39s ipad is finally as good as a standard Samsung tabletbrcool welcome to 2020 apple fansbroh and Samsung tablets have a great file system sitting here on my 4080 g14 that can do literately anything that cost £2500 i dont feel ripped

I39m worried If ipad becomes the main device over laptop or phone then apple is just having monopoly no other brand is even close when it comes to tablet improvements So it39s soo great for Apple to push the quot tablets are the best devicequot narrative Pixel 8a review please because you can there is no why The device is great for creative professionals like architects and VFX artists It39s also great for notetaking All that power is essentially for rendering and multitrack playback Beyond that it39s still a giant phone for Netflix and YouTube For software engineers that baren39tb WebDevs iPadOS still isn39t adequatebrbrIt39s a great nongeneralpurpose computer for nontechie people Whenever iPadOS allows access to system files and not just a siloedoff section of memory that is the equivalent of an empty flash drive allows for app downloads from thirdparty websites allows for compiling of code LOCALLY and natively along with allowing floating windowed apps vs only allowing for tiling two to three apps at a time Only then will it be worth a look for technical folksbrbrFor the rest of us we39ll stick with MacBooks 😄 i saw somewhere that ipads are nerfed macs even with all that power it39s still just an ipad you can39t maximize the hardware because of the limitations of iPadOS I think tablets are mostly bought by med students We have apps that can only run in android or ios so we can39t really buy a pc or mac But i gotta admit consuming content in a tablet is a whole different feel But if you have an option always go for PC ARUN WHERE DID YOU BUY THAT GREY SHIRT FROM

The info should be told in the video It39s not an Apple ad it39s a kind of review and first look But is it worth the price Like Apple prices are just absurd I wonder if Apple is giving you money youtuber guys It is only possible to compare iPad and Mac once or until all apps for which a laptop is used will be optimized for iPad Even though all PC apps don39t work on Macs yet they daydream For the price of one tablet you can get s pc with a 4090 and 7800x3d Brah This iPad is more than 2x the price of my friends gaming pc with 3080Ti Did you also see the 11 inch one If yes is there a difference in the display like the 129quot and the 11quot on the older iPad Short answer “Because I have money” A few days ago I bought a Redmi Pad Se for €210 and compared to my old tablet which was around €110 I have to admit that the price really makes a difference not always of course but in my case yes Regarding this iPad I think it39s too expensive even though certainly better than most tablets on the market but again I would never buy it I think it39s a waste of money It’s such a waste not having 2 USBC slots and the ability to run normal apps It’d be a MacBook Air with an amazing touchscreen Isn39t that foldable with that thickness I can neither confirm nor deny the location of this particular video… I39d love to see a video from you on the Huawei Pura 70 You said the iPad can39t do 100 what a macbook can true but also the mackbook cannot do 100 what an ipad can So just as between iOS and Android  no one device can do it all And still no multiuser on iPad If you need to create a whole video just to convince yourself purchasing this ipad then you’re not the public for the device brDon’t get me wrong it’s a great product for professional creatives designers illustrators animators etc but a macbook is more oriented for other type of professional public coders etc In the end if you want it go ahead and share your experience… I want to convince myself it’s a good optionbrComment sent from an ipad pro 129 from 2018 😅😁 a hrefUCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV11UJgZ8MfY8mzLbnovwK5roC4Bga The greatest youtube and netflix machine ever madeee This is a scam and you should be ashamed of yourself There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEE HERE All this already existed in 2021 when I bought the M1 iPad It can’t do anything a MacBook can do Hell it doesn’t even have a calculator app brbrThis guy has been bought off I am curious do you use the majority of the 8TB on your mac I39m very much a quotget the max options on everythingquot kind of guy but when purchasing my Macbook a year or so ago I ended up limiting myself to only 1TB and its been great and I39m nowhere close to using it all Obviously with content creation you will have a ton more files hence me being curious about how much storage space is truly taken up out of the 8TB big gigabytes How many of you got a Samsung ad before the start of this video🤣💀 Apple realised that samsung39s s9 series were trending so they wanted to be on the spotlight The answer to the vid title is brbrSo I could make a YouTube video about it and get the money back instantly from views Me reading the title quotYou did WHATquot The new M1 iPad Pros are great devices but the problem has always been the same since the first iPad Pro the software Like having the M4 chip which is capable of so much more than iOS can offer That is why Apple should make the iPad Pro run MacOS so it can have way better apps to utilize its internal specs Apple wont do this though because they dont want internal competition with the MacBook Air because the air would basically be pointless with the iPad keyboard and the iPad would still be a better deal I39ll buy a pc with this amount of money At this point over half the video is talking about it because he is too scared to buy it Imagine spending 4k on a tabletwtf is wrong with people I feel like there may be a slight increase in battery life for the new iPad Pro based on 2 factors that can be observed during the presentation The M4 Chip powering the iPad is stated to have 50 more efficiency for a specific amount of power which might help when powering 2 OLED Panels at the same time depending on the workflows you are doing I think it would be interesting to see a battery life comparison for the M2 and M4 iPads You spend because doing a review is your job so constantly you have to upgrade to incite users  From next time don39t use such cheesy lines like why I spent this much on that😂 In an earlier video you mentioned that you could not split screen on mac this is actually possible by making it no longer fullscreen and going to the window tab above They should have made the new pencil compatible with M1 ipads at least I can finally induce headache with an ipad the durability tests for this thing are going to be damning I particularly love the explanation and the way you differentiated a MacBook and iPad really wish I can get that iPad cos am a student it gonna go a long waybrbrThanks Mrwhosetheboss There are plenty of devices far cheaper with far more capabilities than the iPad Honestly if you39re dead set on an iPad Pro  just buy an M1 iPad

want ROG Asus Strix pick whatever year cause they39re all expensive I39ve also been on the fence about getting one at all when my old one still works Lenovo Legion Y740 I think forgot the numbers it just has a terrible battery life and constantly gives static electric shock when you don39t use it on a flat surface Just seeing the numbers of the new iPad made me realize quotYeah I don39t need anything new when my old ones still workquot You can39t draw on a 1200 laptop most of the time So you pretty much bought an iPod that just happens to be wider and longer and happens to come with a stylus I use the iPad Mini for my flying It holds my flight manuals navigational charts and other essential documents electronic flight bags Who got Samsung Ads between this video 😂😂 Regarding your storage issue instead of paying for icloud you could remote connect to a full pc over the ipad and have both a fully granular filesystem and also tons of storage which is expandle if it fills up Then sync it up to a 953939 oled tv via the apple tv in 4K8K then it will be awesome I hope you were able to convince yourself with your own video It’s clear you know it’s not worth it at all But hey new toys Dex laughing from the corner At this point you justifying your expense that u never needed It feels like this thin ipad looks very delicate and  might break amp also bend when it falls  brAll money will be gone in one go Bro why do you have 10 samsung adverts in a this short of a video 😮\\u200d💨 I am watching this in a iPad Pro 5  129 inch If the ipad was ever synced with macOS  it would be an easy straightforward purchase for me Even if it ran above two thousand But if it remains only on iOs then the mini does perfectly what i need I feel like this one he was paid by Apple Overpriced Sadly the software is not there and never going to be until they make it a true computer Hmm Think you got swept up by the Apple event I39d be very surprised if you don39t end up returning this one How much I disagree on the part about the apps working better on mobile I am actually the complete opposite if I am doing any extensive work I purposely make sure I work on a pc Browsers I find work better on pc and I use a lot of engineeringcoding apps like MATLAB which have a terrible mobile version Even the YouTube app is bad it feels like Google has made it significantly worse performing over the past year Maybe it is different for creator apps like the photo editing you mentioned Because your head isn39t cooperating 😂 Just get a pc at this price Obscene is the right word Replace your phone too brother  😅 With all that power Apple still did not have courage to put MacOS on iPad What a disgrace Still no multiwindow feature like Samsung What kind of productivity is this Can I give suggestions for ipad software team brmake a button on keyboard that can onunlock screen without ever touch ipad if use keyboardbrmake a software like totally same to powerpointwordpdf that can read

pc please do drop test and bend test too🙂 Yea nah iOS is so limited The issue remains with iPadOS  even with many improvements over the years you won39t be happy with it in the long run  especially if you in ❤️ with Finder and if you need for your job a few desktop apps that are still very awkward to use Excel Horizon Is anybody here who39s life majorly revolves around chrome extensions Does it

money is the reason I don39t get things too Womp womp look for convertibles this new device sounds like a convertible with apples phone os and thinner to me Convertibles are laptops with a touchscreen where the keyboard can be flipped at the back or removed The most famous convertible not the best i think is the Microsoft Surface series I didn39t even need to check😔 😂😂😂 now stop it we cant be cruel to Bank Managers……actually dont think I have a bank manager its all online lol but until my iPad Pro goes belly up I am not parting with my overdraft for any brilliant pad ………although I could just go

watch can do minus the heart rate monitor The most expensive YouTube player I am assured now that tv companies will utilise the dual led screen tech to make new tvs panels I39m so confused Everything you mentioned about the new iPads replacing your laptop the old ones can do ALL the same things except the Pencil Pro which still is a very niche market compared to standard Apple Pencil 2nd gen users brbrI don39t get why the M1M2 iPad couldn39t replace your computer given they function the same because of the limited noncomputer style iOS meaning it still isn39t a MacBook in any way still much lighter than your MacBook and have ZERO difference in performance when you didn39t talk about gaming in your daytoday lifestyle The old iPads also never got hot either That issue was solved when iPad went to quotMquot chipsbrbrTruthfully it just sound like you39re just catching on late because you didn39t give the previous quotMquot series a real world chance These new models are not worth it when you can get an M1M2 for much less especially after release of these new iPadsbrbrEnd of story So much power and no designated calculator app this has to be some kind of inside joke ipad will never replace a laptop  I can move files from my a android phone to my pc The average person does not need that ipad 😅 For that money they better give me mac os and iPad OS iPad Air went from M1 to M2 iPad Pro went from M2 to M4 That is why they were comparing M4 to M2 M3 was skipped over completely for the iPad To be fair M4 chip without 35mm jack is still useless for video editing if you39re not an artist or a graphic designer or a massive couch potato then iPad is the worst device to buy even after coming 10yearsbrTell me a thing that your iPad can do but not not iPhone iPad  big iPhone And this is coming from a former iPad pro user and I absolutely hated it its not about hardware its about software limitation This makes no sense why when there’s a spec bump that literally doesn’t matter because it’s already too fast for its software and it’s just a little bit thinner can it replace your laptop It’s the same tablet as the year before and the year before that im still waiting to get a new ipad 9th gen for the first time I have had an ipad with cellular service since 2018 and have never regretted it I have very little issues with connectivity even when going to another country as long as I make the proper plans for the service I have plenty of video and files stored on the tablet so dead areas never cause me any more than a minor inconvenience I will say that unfortunately I have had to get used to carrying a messenger bag for the ipad and accessories which does include back up storage I find it convenient enough and carry it around everywhere I even use my 129 inch iPad for the grocery stores app while shopping 3600 to watch netflix OOF That screen buzzle is disgusting Missing cores on lower tier ram options is just deceptive brShould only be one version of the M4 I

the pencil how much more are those worth Surely for the exact experience you39re talking about 3600 falls waaaaaay too short of a price You didn39t spend you invested in creating a video on YouTube and then made more money Not like your subscribers that will really spend a lot of money for nothing 😂 I will never understand why people let Apple get away with a 1000 up charge for just 2TB of storage I hate being forced to install an app Websites on pc can home a lot more information Who is there waiting for new version of iPad Mini with new chip and OLED screen tell me why For me the iPad

couple years ago I mainly use it for CODM In the US without accessories you can spec the Pro 13inch 2tb wifi plus cellular nano texture glass to 2599 I would have ordered the nano textured glass but I couldn39t stomach the extra 700 I don39t need an extra core or 744GB more storage I felt like I was way overpaying as it was 188362 including tax Magic Keyboard Apple Pencil Maybe I should have bought the Air instead of the Pro but I made my decision and I39m sticking to it Veri nice video from Bangladesh watching boss39s videos on 4x speed cuz i got no time but wanna hear the in depth reviews Seriously I’m all for increasingly better tablets  I spend most of my time on my tablet reading news playing casual games watching youtubemovies displaying recipes in my kitchen working from “anywhere” etc  Phones are great but the screen real estate of a tablet is 10 fold better  I continuously want a very powerful responsive stable tablet so I can continue to do these things with modern content and data speeds without getting frustrated and waiting for “processing to happen”  Sure I spend a lot of time on my laptop because it has 2 additional monitors and I can do more work at once when that’s necessary  I also have my PC for epic fun gaming when I have the time  But between work and gaming I’m more on my iPad than any other device for the day to day tasks  So I say keep’em coming brbrEdit ok 3600 is a bit steep but I would have no issue paying that because I’m confident that will last me through the next decade  So 3600 for a device that is gonna last as long as that is totally worth it IMHO  I spent over 5000 on my gaming PC and I don’t expect that to last more than 3 years before it starts to suck… let39s admit it iPad Pro is basically overkill in every aspect while apple is limiting its capabilitiesiPadOS to stop it from killing the macbook39s market Mmm a 16 minuts 11 second apple advertisement As to why Because you can And like another person has said your a tech reviewer and can afford it To me its 39just a nerfed macbook39 sitting in a coffee shop to sketch something isn39t a thing Wanting a drawing padhowever is one I still think the samsung

work in remote like 80 of the time I use my tablet Highly recommended And what do you mean with quotworkquot How many people do you think that work in the same area that you It39s a simple question franciscodiaz5778 i am a marine surveyor I mostly use my table for emails access to the company sharepoint and for drawing handling I use pdf versions of the drawings and make notes on the pdf using the apple penbrbrAnyone that is using sharepoint and microsoft applications like teams onedrive outlook etc which I believe is most of us can use the iPad Pro instead of the laptop It works perfectly The laptop can be used only for special applications that cannot run in the iPad Pro Built by people in China making less than US minimum wage bro was goin down on that toothbrush ONG 😂 😅 Not me being in the same frame of mind without a job like yours I think you made this video just to justify to yourself why in the name of God would you spend that money on a tablet 😂 Okay so here39s my hot take brGet the s9 ultra tabletbrEnjoy the big screen brDoubles as second monitor not PCbrTablets ain39t replacing laptops anytime soon 🤝 brSave 2400 dollars 👍 How many likes can this comment get Apple is straight up scamming people at this point I’ve said it once amp I’ll say it againbrbrGet a Mac Mini  Studio for hardcore performance in your home officebrbramp an iPad to use in the field because the touch amp pen are better than a MacBookbrbrAs soon as you get home your iPad will instantly sync with your Mac amp you can have your Mac do the more intense work 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 Oh wow a Mac with a touch screen b90b are here only for getting likes 👍 on bcomment likeb every one 😂 Damn did I just watch a 16 minute Apple commercialbrbrMKBHD is over there bankrupting companies and Mrwhosetheboss is over here increasing AAPL stock no way its 36k I can39t wait for them to put this tandem oled screen on a macbook pro It will definitely be a purchase for me as soon as they do that Keep it up guys 💪 M4 iPad Pro for 3600 you know its deep when you have to make a video without the item to afford paying for the item Bro telling us broke folk how he just spent his bread to test expensive stuff Waiting for Apple to put M1 in an iPhone lol a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt380620a wait but I squeeze my pencil when I draw Crazy vid it shows how hard you work as you could see like the outside getting darker Considering this runs iOS this feels like a paid ad lol It39s like making audience quotsomehowquot convince that this gen iPad is better Some valid points Most people just need photo managing app browser and YouTube That39s why my mom has Chromebook You can’t even play Fortnite on the M4 LOL Anyone know what Eink tablet he is using I still can39t use a tablet because of the apple limitations of the actually good tablets Dudes a shill 3600 dollars for a tablet Nah I39m good with pc Unless apple opens up things on iPad and we can start running mac apps in some way iPad will always be of limited use  useless for me For 3600 might as well get a dope pc and a camera This is shilling on another level Who buys a Mac for Games I know I never did They’re people out there that find a lot of value in an iPad but not 3600 worth of value They should just do what they did with the iPod for a while Super bulk make it then just leave it there so those who need it can buy it and if demand is really that bad just leave till supply runs out Is it foldable 🤡🤣 You can still return it I39m a windows user but for tablet iPad is light years ahead from competitor Apple already releases M4 Tablet never seen a single Tablet using X Elite or Core Ultra Can I have your macbook pro if you don39t want it anymore ◡̈ I have never had a Mac always a windows laptop and mid tower The only apply products I’ve ever had are iPhone and AirPods I never thought I’d want my next laptop to be an iPad Without even watching we all know coz you are a Apple fan boy Whatever that floats your boat brother 😂 Keep buying Chinese stuff and giving your data to the Chinese government It39s definitely mindblowing how technology continues to evolve making everything more compact yet more powerful As a MacBook user shifting to an iPad as a main device sounds like a bold move However with the potential to do better in terms of gaming photo editing and even video editing it could be worth the risk video editing won39t be good lol imagine 50 slower render 💀 KenScepterNah is not render Speed Literally there is no other editing video program on iPad than LumaFusion and FCP 💀💀 I still like a big screen It’s just nice lesser powerful dolt Everyone knows an iPad won39t be better at ANY of them Bradfo8dz everyone knows touchscreen games are popular maybe even more than desktop Yeah sure the iPad has all that power and yet you can39t use any of it due to software limitations imposed by apple alysdexia Its all games candy crush and castle crashers and a few 3d games with rubbish controls They burn a few minutes but hardly quotgamingquot Good luck with that on IpadOS alysdexia and who pays 3600 to play some shitty mobile games and do mediocre editing Trevor90 not power dolt How should it be better in gamingbrThere are no profound games for iPad in contrast to Mac Bradfo8dz takes controllers also \\u200balysdexiamobile games are all trash Purplegreen45 “an iPad” not this configuration It has 0 potential to do better in any that  In fact its already known and proven to do worse   This product must be a late April fools prank by Apple alysdexia\\xa0just spend 200 on a Switch or Steam deck if you want to play decent games on the go Why would it be worth the risk when there is little of any benefit in replacing your laptop with an iPad  The cost for the iPad might actually be higher than a similarly priced laptop Additionally with the addition of the keyboard it39s not that much smaller if it all then a laptop  Then there are the lack of ports and software  And what about interfacing with the tablet I find using a mouse on the iPad isn39t nearly as direct and precise as my Macbook Pro alysdexia Why would anyone spend thousands for playing quottouchscreen gamesquot Trevor90 What’s the point of all that power when it has no active cooling system maybe an hour before performance begins to get crippled NightWolfx7578 can’t spell or explain Bradfo8dz I own Switch charcoal  The drawing detail and franerate are worse robertp457 iPads don’t cost thousands and OP said more than gaming strawman  I got my mini 6 new for 400 alysdexia what39s the point of a good framerate on ios games though Bradfo8dz what’s a question and what are search engines for  Also you mean iPadOS with the extra resolution unless you game heavily a powerful tablet is uselessbrbrFor artists a mid level tablet is good enough because for heavy work they still rely on PC  drawing tabletbrbrEven for a powerful tablet any productivity is lower than a mid laptop unless part of your productivity is to look ridiculous at a cafebrbrEmulation and game streaming is still shit on iOS or ipad OS 11inches is too big to do anything comfortably the Legion Y700 is perfect for this thobrbrin fact everything you mentioned except for the pencil is better on the legion Y700 because of a the more convenient size Excellent information I like the questions that you still have remaining Those are the exact same questions that I’m thinking about at the current time as to whether to update my iPad Pro which I just purchased in December of last year But I am going to be doing more YouTube videos And editing possibly Right now I edit on my windows desktop computer computer I’m also concerned about the battery life I get so frustrated sometimes when my battery goes down to like 3 I plug it in for the night and when I come back in the morning about six or seven hours later it’s not 100 and I’ve been working with the Support team to remove a whole bunch of stuff that I don’t need in order to get a better longer battery life And you’re absolutely right why would I need one or 2 TB when I can plugin something to have that I still have a lot of questions I have cellular on my current iPad But it doesn’t let me do much I just can’t answer her phone call if it comes in and my cell phone which is an iPhone 15 Pro isn’t by my side you did answer one question that I had was whether my external magic keyboard works on the new one I prefer the external one because then I don’t always have to carry it Well again or questions Until I get answers I’m not going to order a new one 3600 I think that’s worth more than my car Chuckling how does that conversion even ake sense i thought the dollar was equal to a pound now This is the dumbest line up I WANT ONE dammm bro 256 gb is enough for me with some 4k video editings but how can you use 8tb of storage and get it full cause you have it That’s a cool shirt Answer he’s rich Still no calculator 😂 use a thunderbolt SSD for storage I have a Sabrent Rocket for my Ipad its great i have a bit of velcro tape on the ipad case and on the ssd to take it on and off and i also have velcro on my desktop and my laptops for when i move the SSD between the 3 devices Nope I39ve seen this scene before with Apple Them making a thin device  bendgate 20 I wonder how many people even end up using its full power😂 Need to sell my kidney to buy 😅😅 quotmy Massive laptopquot Dude That39s a thin and light laptop This video is an excuse for a tax write off 😆 Go a Lenovo Yoga tabletit39s got a built in handle and  dont have to deal with Apple Puns are definitely getting worse Your next video should be I bought every Sega console I wanted 15 inch iPads Question Would the nanoscreen act more paperlike for the pencil as opposed to the glossy screen I bought the Air 5 just the moment it came out back in 2022 and now im here contemplating if i should sell it and get the new ipad pro 2024 The new pro an amazing piece of tech but i know im only going to be using it for watching movies and writing documents 😅 FINDME A KOI It39s probably good to read a book on with its double display and all It39s much easier to replace a phone with a foldable That39s why conscious consumers like us have a z fold 4 Imagine buying apple products intentionally though😅 I usually really like your videos but this one feels vey much like clickbait a deadly sin for any serious content creator 99 of users do not need a configuration that will cost 3600 You might want that configuration but most people do not I wish you trusted that your content was relevant because it is without needing to resort to tactics that really jeopardize a creator’s credibility I believe you are better than that The pen only work for newest ipad version😂😂😂 Dont call it computer It does not support docker I can’t wait to see this in the background next to his Mac Pro Yeah you know what else is 3500 the Apple Vision Pro are you gonna say pay the same price for an Apple Vision Pro as you  would on an  iPad nah this aint it 3600 on a device that gets replaced by my computer Hell if i wanted a phone  computer id get an s24 ultrawhich has Samsung dex or id get a phone and a good computer This really doesn39t seem loke a smart purchase at all We live in a world where apple charges 400€ for a keyboard and trackpadbrI don’t think I even want to know the profit margin on that As an architect this iPad has been very useful Having a full 3D model of an office park in your hand is amazing during construction You got this already Don39t confuse iPad and Vision Pro the M1 iPad does everything you would need as an architect even an iPad air would do great jokered1133 He obviously misspoke The M4 iPad Pro has not been released yet It goes on sale May 15 My Cellular M1 iPad Pro has been my favourite purchase for years now id definitely recommend cellular for those who travel I think an M4 Pro is in my future It would be perfect if it can run MacOS but of course Apple wont do that because it will cannibalize Macbook sales and also MacOS is not designed to be touchfriendly Maybe give it a quotDexquot mode Bought the remarkable tablet to replace paper notebooks Nothing more nothing less Don’t have a laptop use the iPad Pro M2 Won’t buy the M4 iPad Pro Not worth the upgrade The Samsung Galaxy Tab9 Ultra does all of that and has DEX The thing about iPads for me is that sure they’re excellent hardware and I love their form factor  but their operating system is so limited Once I switched from iPhone to Android and my phone and tablet no longer talked properly it felt like all I had left was essentially a very pretty chromebook with a touchscreen All the power of an M1 chip but nothing I do on it feels any faster than it does on a SnapdragonbrbrThere were a few key features that kept it from being a true laptop replacement for me  things I needed to do that simply were not on the App Store and because of no sideloading I couldn’t do them Points where due it was my favorite way to do the things I did on my phone up until the moment half of them became impossible for me to do on an Applebranded tablet and my only regret was that I spent 900 on a 256gb Air 5 and accessories when I could’ve been happy spending 600 on a 64gb iPad 10 and lower end accessories  but it loses a lot of points for becoming a really nice paperweight the moment the ecosystem disappeared from around itbrbrAnyway I just ordered a Tab S8 Ultra refurbished for 470 to hopefully recapture what the iPad did as well as what I hoped it would do  be better at doing things I did on my phone when I have it with me and also do all the things I do on a laptop every Windows productivity tool I use is available on Android either natively or with a workaround Bruh what a pain in the ahh when someone bends it by accident 💀 LOLSbetter buy PC than this crap device we can buy tablet way cheaper than this but also powerful for daily use This is too much from apple Crazy but nothing is special on this device lols be wise on spending Can39t install macOS on it What a piece of bb it39s definitely not worth 3600 just because of that single fact Hopefully with iPad OS18 this new iPad will be more functional Highest end and still cant run MacOS or proper desktop OS 😂 bmw m4 was waiting for your iPad Pro 2024 review to hear your take on it Already seen MKBHDs take i feel you both have two different prospective same mofos buyin new phones and 35k tablets every year are the same people complaining about a 500 game console First of all you have Money 8T Arun Before even watching this video let’s be real about your thumbnail “Why I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4” You did it because you’re privileged enough to where that kind of money is not an issue to you whatsoever because it’s a business write off a clickbaity and engaging title for a new video and because your line of work pays disproportionally high vs the vast majority of others who put in the same hours into different careers Movies on ipad pro sucks because aspect ratio means it39s mildly bigger than iPhone max for the size of a macbook air Bla bla bla you are a macbook guy eventually you will make a video later “why I decided to ditch m4 ipad pro”  3600 L Bro that toothbrush was sus af BRO ONG 🤣🤣  Brody set himself up  on his knees and all 💀 Dude39s making the same mistakes we all made in 2018  Queue the video on two months where he finds out he loves the iPad but apple won39t let him do any of the things he needs to do about it that with all on the Mac but the Mac isn39t as fun as the iPad so he39s going back to his Mac 😅 The next Mac Convention WW whatever don’t know the name will be decisive brEither very good comes for the future of iPad  or … you’re right thats so true not if altstore and other apps are coming to ipad os gaberil Altstore U can emulate Omg that hurt I actually did make this mistake in 2018 😂😂 GROSSFIT the wwdc won39t change anything don39t hold your breath on that one i want to be proven wrong but they39re not gonna let you use mac apps on that thing What’s the name of that writing pad you have I still have and use my 2018 iPad Pro 11” daily and it’s incredible It’s basically just a media device for me tbh but I do really want to get this new iPad Pro man I love how thin and light it is I remember the iPad Air 2 was also under a pound back in 2014 and it was awesome Its still just an Ipad I39ve tried three times to move from my air to my ipad pro but every time I run into the same problem Lack of desktop class apps walled in ios garden Issues with websites that refuse to treat it like anything but a quotphonequot accessing it Watched the entire video Still not convinced to buy I mean apart from calling it the most expensive book or digital art device what else can you do with it Im completely fine with my book pen and sketchbook thank you very much coming from a person who owns 6 expensive devices so its not about the money Also NO TABLET should cost that much at that point Apple is too damn greedy asking consumers for over 2 grand US for a tablet A subtle mrwhosetheboss thumbnail i never thought i39d soo the day Can39t tell if he was watching gameplay or ACTUALLY playing ZZZ but if it39s what I think it is then he sure is damn lucky Paid review Apple sucks brainwashed their customers for less but pay the same Make you iGlad lol I love this When I rationalize a purchase I just do it in my head mrwhosetheboss needed to make a video to convince himself  APPLE39s Announcement in short  The New iPad Pro is now Sandwich Pro  Thinner and rest all the shit is same  Oops almost forgot We named CPU 39M439 for no Reason  Also for a touch of Sweet and Sour we also changed the  display name as Tamarind OLED  Sorry Tandem technically dumb OLED😂  With this Renaming Briilance Apple is now PineApplee🤣🤣🤣 This is the best bullshit review ive ever heard from him ipad pro m1 13…here… and no… ipados not a laptop replacement yet and usb2hdmi dongle hanging hurts my OCD… keyboard amp pencil doesn’t go well sometimes… I’ll wait more to upgrade Even though he is hyping this up it’s not computer No matter how much he tries to say “it’s amazing” It still just a tablet Then you want to copy a file somewhere You39ll find it still sucks on an iPad not matter how fast and how light and how thin the new shiny thing is Or try copying or moving a photo or video from an Android phone to an iPad like copying a video clip to edit on an iPad in LumaFusion 👎🏻No matter how highly you praise an iPad its limitations are clear Without fullfeatured Microsoft apps and a robust internet browser it falls short for many users Let39s hope future updates address these gaps and unlock the iPad39s full potential New iPad Pro consbrbr▫️Apple removed the 2nd rear camerabr🔸Apple removed 1 studio microphonebr🔹Apple Pencil 2 won’t work with itbr🔻Existing Magic Keyboard won’t work with it br🔺The M4 chip in the 256 and 512 GB models is a binned whip with lower GPU and performance cores than getting an 1T or 2T model which has the fully unlocked M4 chip I’m sorry if I’m spending 3600 dollars and it cost more than my MacBook Pro  This shit better run Mac OS programs Who the F is gonna buy this junk If you can’t dock this and have it become a Mac I see no point Bro got too comfortable with that toothbrush laughed a little when i heard the “iglad” joke 🤣 My circle wonder why i enjoy apple ecosystem When i mention that macbook air 2017  ipad pro 11 2020  iphone 7 still usable they were shocked Soon i’ll upgrade to m4 series amp hope the new iphone se release at the same time Almost everybody who has a career that is not content creation and requires a laptop will not be able to replace it with any iPad The iPad is purposely designed to just be right on the edge to be able to replace a laptop enough so that you think it will and you buy it but you still also end up buying a laptop anyways Trust me guys the tab s9 is superior and more fun to use  One of the best I39ve owned  It comes w s pen in box  is water proof brhas micro SD card  has open operating system etc  Also apple got that apple pencil idea from Samsung Because you are not smart if this thing had what the samsung tablets had and mac app support then id be worth it at this level of thin it has to have some kind of endoskeleton or else it will be bent within a week you are a pro video editor how can you be considering replacing a real computer It feels like Apple is really trying to stall as long as they can before finally just making a touch screen MacBook How long til they make an iPad with a pro level processor and a sturdy enough keyboard with ports that can just merge the two products It would be an absolutely amazing single device Hmmm I39ll keep my Amazon HD Tablet 99 bucks Perfect Ipad has a light version of Microsoft office that39s sucks can39t do VBA can39t have all excel normal function to work like a pro Smart toothbrush 🤨 Bruh got all the money back with this video 😂 I did the same thing and it was not really goodbrThe functionality is another so goodbrI bought it with the keyboard and pencil brBut still it did Not work the same brI have to say though that cod on full settings was really fun the trend is going on Big PC Houses to Desktop PC to Laptops to Ipads smaler Bro I’m telling this was a bad decision iPads have indeed made significant strides as laptop replacements and for many they serve that purpose well Yet personally nothing quite compares to the reliability of a MacBook with its sturdy hinge and the convenience of an operating system meticulously designed for seamless mouse and keyboard interaction While the distinction between the two is narrowing at the moment an iPad is still an iPad for me i feel him turning into mumbo jumbo NOPE I guess I’m done with Apple Why the need to go thinner and thinner I39d prefer a bit thicker than the last model leading to a heck more battery life I have an explanation stupidity But does it run Fusion the audio sounds bad Give us Mac OS on iPad and I’m in Wow you finally get your first touch screen Mac as an iPad 😂 what a surprise that Apple it’s pushing the iPad as replacement shocking 😮 Cause you39re not very smart Nice niceCan I have ur MacBook anyways a

I also ordered the maxed spec39d iPad Pro 13quot I hope I don39t regret ordering the nano textured glass option 🤔 The maximum price I can get one of them to be in the USA Apple Store is US2599 I realize that the UK price converted to US is much higher than that but the title is somewhat misleading IMO better to just list the UK price in £ instead All of this is just a cute spec bump unless iPad OS is updated like it should be this year Otherwise  unless you have money to burn just buy a used iPad I can’t wait to see Jerryrigeverything fold this in half like a piece of paper Sorry I39m not spending top shelf desktop money on a tablet Period That39s a 4080 almost 4090 perbuilt turf And this ladies and gentlemen is the”justification” section of a successful direct marketing campaign he’s been won over by the device on an emotional level he’s now sure he wants to make the purchase but he needs to justify it to himself first by saying “it has great specs it’s so powerful it could solve this problem for me or make that task easier” etc And when he’s thoroughly convinced himself he’ll hit “buy” Apple’s marketing wins again But in all seriousness this new iPad Pro is a very impressive piece of tech Especially for those who use their iPads for art purposes Hope you don’t stress too much 🙄 Why not to make 146 inch tablet mrwhosetheboss I’m sure they will release at WWDC a software feature that will allow iPad Pro to operate as macOS when docked to the Smart Keyboard Imagine the PC I could build with 3600🥸 Final Cut Pro has live Multicam and it makes me so happy Please do a part 2 in a month on how you like it brThanks what e note pad is he using What a propanada kind of video Not expected on this channel Because by reviewing it you made 36000a hrefUCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV11UJgxsIfY4OqCd2T29sP54iAsAwa I39d definitely need it to match macbook pro performance and support at least 2 additional displays 3 display setup before I39d even start to consider it as a macbook replacement  The screen on it39s own makes we want to upgrade from my old basic iPad just for my super basic iPad use cases I39m gonna have to disagree on the software front The lockeddown nature of iPadOS is the biggest weakness of the iPad Pro You did mention the file management which is huge On my Android I use a third party file manager that works super well and is feature rich Additionally apps can have access to the file system directly which is critical for local music players In terms of games you need to pay a subscription for most good games This applies to most software as well and I really hate renting software On Mac and especially Windows and Linux there is a treasure trove of great free as in beer AND as in freedom software that is focused on the user rather than emptying your wallet 3600 😮 Apple don39t actually make their own screens it39s probably made by Samsung You made several rather strange  subjective and misinformed comments Just had to voice this The fact apple called the new  apple pencil quotApple pencil quotproquot It39s basically apple pencil 3rd generation I might be missing something but I have kind of been using an tablet like this since 2015 Windows surface has been my travel computer for processing image39s during my world trip It been my main laptop since then Uppgraded once

microsoft 365 better portability and most importantly can use the same charger as iphone i would choose ipad as mac replacement Apple will stop macbook and sell ipad with separate sell for pencil keyboard case and trackpad And just charging cable in the box It39s about time a good executor got released I wonder how wave is going to be levi7147 Ok but why is it iOS and not MacOS Who is tablet for  Didn39t watch the video just saw the title  you39re nuts  So its a laptop that lacks the adaptability i want from a laptop plus being a good touch screen i guess no thanks Waste of money could

need an ipad cost of a high end laptop brI aint spending 23 times the budget of my gaming laptop to watch youtubenetflix or ipad kids Don39t do it Perhaps you could make a review on the best iPad case with all its different user preferences I would love to see the pro’s and cons between the Logitech combo touch and the apple Magic Keyboard Remarkable needs backlighting and it39s not enough responsive don39t buy it answer  quoti39m a youtuber with 185 million and i love to spend just little money for tempting my audience Why he brush his teeth like that Not replacing a MacBook as long as iPad OS remains what it is most expensive ipads yet Let39s burn money for fun For me I think WWDC is going to decide if I  get this new one or not The M2 is more then capable enough I didn39t see anything during the keynote at least for my  use case that appealed to me My iPad has pretty much replaced my  need for a laptop I have a Windows desktop if I need to do some  serious heavy lifting and my iPad handles everything else I use DaVinci Resolve and it handles find on my iPad for my needs My photo work is all done via Darkroom  and  now Lightroom Capture One was a dumpster fire at launch and I haven39t looked back at it  Honestly I was really skeptical at first but the iPad has become my favorite Apple thing It’s good for reading Nope iPadOs is different from MacOs It won39t feel like a MacBook until developers of the app make it so Event using canva is different on ipad better on macbook 😢brbrThe advantage point of this ipad is you39ll get a bigger lighter extra screen for your MacBook From being a big phone to a small laptop tablets have come a long way They should just add MacOS as a boot feature on the ipad 3600 for half of the performance and less capabilities of an already pricey MacBook I39ve never seen a video of you that felt like grasping for straws like this one This really felt like an ad but i know it isn39t However i39m happy you found a product you39re excited about Pricer than Vision Pro I didn39t see it that way I saw it as he finally found a tablet that actually fits in his life How is it half the performance What about Microsoft surface of a macbook pro it exceeds the capabilities of the most recent macbook air It’s more powerful than MacBooks with m4 its the os that’s limited Staralium iPad 1TB nano texture  pencil pro  keyboard costs 2677 in the US Vision Pro costs 3900 As M1 iPad Pro user i would never upgrade to any other iPad until they remove virualization restrictions remove background app restrictions add launchctl make Xcode for iPadOS and replace this weird cursor with the normal one jonathanodude6660Other MacBooks have a fan while this doesn’t shahbazfawbushI hate my damn surface it works like absolute shit Youtuberku4nk It39s not He doesn39t know what he is talking about The M4 iPad Pro has higher performance than any MacBook because no MacBook has an M4 yet All that power to run a mobile OS Why Apple are still subjecting its hardware to this easy work is beyond mewhy aren39t iPads running MacOS If they39re as powerful as Apple say then it should be easy Shut up apple and take ma money More expensive worse battery life removed a camera cant use old accessories With this amount you can buy an iphone 15 macbook and airpods  You cant replace laptops or pc it is fhat simple Yes phones are getting better and tablets but the main gadget for work remains the laptop or pc You can get the latest inter core ultra or any sort of amd cpu either threadripper or ryzen 4080 or 4090 and it will be undeniably better I like the fact that you don39t have an iphone Don39t get sucked into their closed off ecosystem Because you are a youtuber and you do reviews Brah that tooth brush scene was suspect lol Uh you literally have a vid on this channel from only a few years ago about how the previous iPad model is so amazing and efficient and is invaluable to you at work and now you39re suddenly quotnot a tablet guyquot and the thought of buying a tablet is weird to you The price is way too much in the current economic environment you have all the tech and too much money at your disposal to judge these things accurately apple need badly calling out for their walled garden practices user freedom impingement lack of control over their own data within the apple ecosystem and you have a responsibility to do this on behalf of consumers As you deleted my comment brI will be unsubscribing Why did you delete my comment brAbout can39t wait until you drop it what things in videos that you have reviewed as random cheap tech but actually use daily or often Mrwhosetheboss I wouldn’t buy Apple just wait the price would come down Apple is a greedy company Apple is trying to copy Samsung DeX which is far better experience even with a Samsung phonebrPeople will still buy this for status and not functionality How the hell is this more expensive than the AVP I’m watching this knowing I will never have anything expensive 3600 Foolishness so true you are spitting straight facts mkbhd A 16 mins video just to justify himself in his mind why he wants to spend that amount of money It39s cos you can afford due to the hard work you put in over the years And that39s awesome and well deserved 100 😎🙌👊brbrButtttt on the flip side no one working regular jobs can justify this at all Nothing is moving me away from Linux I know that’s what I thought while watching about the battery life iPad already looks bent in the thumbnail 😭 As a medical student who replaced my laptop with an iPad m2 permanently I do have some serious takes on this Just as advise The new iPad pro’s and the old ones have the hardware of a laptop which is incredible but there is no way to utilise it properly since there is not a single app on the iPad available that pushes the CPU and GPU to its max Besides that all the apps on the iPad are the phone versions except for the webbrowsers Which for me as a student is a huge disadvantage I miss so many functions in apps like word and excel which are programs I have to use on a day to day basis With projects I hit a wall very quick because I don’t have all the features you would have on a desktop And the availability of apps is far more limited on the iPad than on a MacBook or windows laptop This could be fixed if apple enabled side loading on the iPad but they already made clear this will likely never happen I need so many programs for school that the App Store just doesn’t support It really is a dealbreaker sometimes I do love the iPad for note taking and studying though I am much more productive when it comes to studying than I would be if I had a laptop Goodnotes is a goated app which is my entire file explorernote taking place It is so easy so write things down and make incredibly visual summaries It works so smooth too and I can get a lot more out of studying this way brbrAlso I have the Logitech combo touch and not the Magic Keyboard And there are 3 key features that make the Logitech case superior for me than the Magic Keyboard Firstly the Logitech case offers way more protection which you would want if you carry a tablet of 1200 euro’s around Secondly the keys on the Logitech keyboard are lighter which I find more pleasant to type on On days where I have to type a lot I wouldn’t want my fingers to get tired of the typing And lastly you can detach the keyboard from the case magnetically which is SUCH A HANDY feature I can’t address this enough You can just snap the keyboard of just like that while maintaining the protection of the case mostly and you get the kickstand with it That is so useful No keyboard in the way and a kickstand There are countless times where I just snap the keyboard off to showcase something really quick to a classmate or to watch a movie without a keyboard in the way I do believe that because of that feature it maintains the ‘tablet vibe’ of the combination If you have your tablet in a keyboard case all day long it is surprisingly easy to forget that it is a tablet and not a desktop Being able to remove the keyboard just makes it easy to switch to ‘tablet mode’ to put it like that Also the Logitech keyboard is a lot cheaperbrbrI do think that a keyboard case on the iPad is tricky The Magic Keyboard really makes you believe your iPad is a laptop Which ofcourse can do similar tasks but it is easy to forget that touch screen controls will ALWAYS be superior than controlling the iPad via a keyboard and trackpad That is what a tablet is designed for The trackpad is very useful I can’t deny that but there are plenty of times where I just snap the iPad from the keyboard and use it as a tablet because it is just easier and makes the experience actually more fun brbrThe passthrough charging on the case doesn’t really matter to me I carry an adapter with me at all times because I need to connect my iPad to an external drive or a monitor quite frequently The adapter that I have also has a slot for charging the iPad while the adapter is plugged in so I wouldn’t get much use out of the passthrough chargingbrbrBe careful with replacing your desktops with an iPad people It has serious advantages but also disadvantages that don’t get adressed enough An iPad is ofcourse very useful and cool but I think in most cases you would be better off with a laptop Yet

docs On my Mac I can open five docs at the same time and three next to each other and on the iPad I can maximum two and it39s much more finally and uncomfortable Ridiculous pricing again by apple  So good youll still need a mac book pro to use all its feature So goooooooooddd You did it because you have money to waste This dude really spent 3600 on an iPad Dude just hyping everything on iPad right now while forgetting that it39s all literally copied from Android tablets😂😂😂😂😂😂brbrIsheep from cave 😂😂😂 I would be interested if it could even do half the things I need on my Mac I use my Mac for game design web coding and open source software Which to my knowledge isn39t on any iPad I clicked on thisto sayI DON39T CARE AN M1 ipad would be good for many years Once iPadOS and MacOS are interchangeable and we can use the benefits of these new chips and it full on replaces the laptop THEN it will be a game changer but to me a 2010 iPad is a 2024 iPad what39s the difference It39s usually iPadOs it39s using apps it39s using a keyboard and a pencil it39s a tablet there39s no reason to own a new iPad if you already own onebrbrI think it will be 2026 before anyone actually would quotneedquot an iPad for work or college until thenenjoy spending £2600 when you could get an M3 MacBook Air probably for the same price I39m hearing stories that ipad is at last replacement of the laptop for at least 5 years or even more brNow it became best way to identify that video is sponsored by Apple because they desperately want people to use it not just for watching yt videos and drawing sketches We39re 400000 subscribers away from the Giant iPhone build video let39s goooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Its all fun and games until you want to run some docker containers The answer to your question is very simplebrbrYou are monetizing the contents You39ll be in for a disappointment when quickly learning the limitations of iPad Hardware in iPad Pro M4 is magnificent I would trade my way more powerful MacBook Pro to iPad Pro if it was just about HW\\xa0brbrUnfortunately apps and OS are just way too limited to ever leave the house without MacBook Pro if you expect to get work done\\xa0brbrFurthermore Remarkable has a killer feature that iPad can never copy It does very little Thus there are no distractions Every hyping slim iPad as if that wasn39t on Samsung since beginning of time 😂😂😂😂 Yeah the whole tech thing is really important but where did you get that sweatshirt from Love it  OH MY GOD CAN WE STOP COMPARING IPADS TO MAC LAPTOPS It’s not even close it’ll NEVER be close I have both a ipad and a MacBook YouTubers keep insulting our intelligence by comparing iPadOS to a full desktop experience It’s this a way to justify spending MacBook prices on a tablet I LOVE iPad but 3000 for iPadOS because that’s what you’re buying  is just dumb or flexing Why are you paying all this money for this new iPad Pro M4 Because you have 185 million subscribers Why would you want to use an Apple product Could be me but I don39t see a need for it to be that thin I like things having thickness Then it feels like it has worth Because you know how to waste your money The hardware is cool and all but I suppose my issue is the line between laptop and quotbig phonequot is just an artificial boundary created by Apple iPads have been powerful enough to literally just run MacOS for years now  there is no technical limitation preventing them from creating a device that does this They haven39t allowed it because it would cannibalise MacBook sales so they39ve kept the two user experiences separate This whole narrative of quotit can now do everything a laptop can doquot falls a bit flat for me because of course it can If they wanted to Apple could literally have built a hybrid device that runs iPad OS with it39s not got a keyboard attached and MacOS when it does The hardware is all there Its cool that the iPad experience is getting closer and closer to a true quotlaptopquot experience but I have yet to see a compelling reason from Apple that explains WHY we are quotgetting closerquot instead of quotalready therequot at all What I can do with iPad can be done with my phone Bro hates docters bc it39s your job sounds like the last missing piece to real life star trek datapads is to make them foldable D Thinnest device ever What about the polishing

you can use your phone as a hotspot True a cell can be a hotspot My provider throttles the hotspot speed Then I need to make sure that I enable the hotspot whenever I want to use my iPad Or I can just get 5G goodness on the iPad so that I can open it and use it at any time without having to do anything else It is a different experience martyscholes119 I didn’t say it wasn’t a completely different experience But in my opinion they’re not different enough to justify paying for another data plan Once they integrate the ability to side load apps then I39ll consider it you dont have time to use

to my Samsung Galaxy TabletbrIt39s 5️⃣ X cheaper What about a Macbook Pro with a touchscreen for what i use my laptop for i can do it all on my Samsung tablet the magic keyboard despite it being pretty expensive would basically be all i would ever need But using the apple pencil to turn it into a note taking device and pretty interesting also multitasking on tablets is a great experience imo

buys this over a beast pc You could even buy a motorcycle with that money 500 bucks is the limit for an iPad imo… I39m not going to spend that much on an iPad N e v e r As an artist and architect I have to say a tablet goes a long ways in work processes It’s definitely becoming a niche product for professionals 400k until you catch up to apple Just get a surface pro instead it is such a good tablet many people forget to compare it to other tablets and it ends up being compared to laptops more often than tablets I feel like you could have done this video 3 years ago Not much new here and really not worth the high end price for the 1 and 2 GB models You can use Sidecar with a Macbook and 13 inch iPad Air That way you have a slick 2 screen setup on the go a real laptop and the touch

starting off so expensive for the Pro models but its Apple right they have made a lot of good changes to iPad Os to allow for less constraints but there is always room for more freedomsupport here Good thing there is not a MacBook 360 or this ipad would NOT sell Unfortunately pad OS is bottlenecking the ipad so tragicly 3600 dollars for a tablet I could39ve bought a PC which probably would have been much more worth it 😭 nice background music I sheep 4 times the average salary in slovakia and still no calculator  in Canada it is almost 4k Youtube machine Ipad OS ruins the experience Our 5

This inflation is deeper than we think Those buying groceries are well aware that the real inflation is much over 10 The increments don39t match our income yet certain invstors still earn over 365000 in stocks and assets Wish I could accomplish thatb I have an ipad pro 6th gen M2 I never use it The only time I use it is when I feel bad for not using it Or when I use it for my survey work but that is to make my job easier and rare Other than that it hardly gets used It is already pretty thin Im not sure it needs to be any thinner brPersonally if it is just a screen and faster chip then I

till you open the Instagram app Now your brainrot ads can load faster Bruh you have unlimited money just buy the damn ipad 💀 58K I just purchased one on PayPal credit I have 4 months to pay 😢 Tablets need PCLaptop OS not a Phone OS Then we can talk It39s so expensive you can buy the most expensive gaming PC and still have enough to buy the rest that you need like monitor mouse keyboard etc For the price it39s just pointless unless you ABSOLUTELY need it for like that 1 or 2 apps But if you need to other accessories then buy a mac If they made a Mac with an Apple Pencil the iPad will just vanish To answer the clickbait…My guess you have the money and needed some good content Could be wrong Apple takes a dump on their consumers every year and their loyalists eat it up every time Samsung wins the tablet market just for allowing their tablets to become PCs using DEX Thinner and more powerful definitely priorities And of course make it more expensive just what we need in this day and age As an Apple fan I feel they’re out of touch with reality and what most people want Wouldn’t be surprised if down the line cheaper competitors keep taking more and more of their market share What is even the point in owning an iPod nano 7th gen in 2024 when it39s no longer Apple39s thinnest device 😉😛 3600 really Apple treating its consumers 🤡 Why is this guy always flexing over how much money he can

an expensive toy Even my ipad pro gen 2 seems way overpowered for what ipad OS can do The new screen is nice sounding but Ipad OS needs a lot of work before i care at all about improvements in compute power I do love my ipad pro gen 2 but i am searching for a reason to want to upgrade I use my iPad every day all day but I must admit It39s not the tech that lets it down It39s iOS It just isn39t up to the capability of OSX This is made particularly apparent when using programs such as Keynote which are dumbed down almost unusable compared to the OSX version Even simple things like dragging attachments from one email to another can be a nightmare On the plus side my iPad has never crashed or overheated so there39s that but iOS leaves a ton to be desired Because you39ll make more than the cost by simply making a video about it And you can write it off as a work expense I could think of a couple different reasons why you bought it XD All we39ve asked for is a decent ipad mini that gets updated 2k or a bare minimum 1080p upscaled 120 hz batleastb oled screen no liquid retina or we apple calls them an overclocked processor that is better than or rivals samsung some amenities from the higher end lineups ie centeredcameraproductivity seamless ecosystem features ect an apple pencil support that should work just as well as it does on the ipad pro with the edition of pro apps you39d

This functions are what samsung had years back iphone always make it seem like its new and big deal🤣🤣🤣 anyone else thinks background on it is ugly I love my iPad Pro I won’t be upgrading for years but I wouldn’t be without one for sure I suffer severe migraines… a heavy laptop is too heavy to take to bed with me the phone is not big enough for movies and so the iPad just suits me so much I can lay whatever position I need to and still have a decent screen with decent sound I also love using Procreate on it as I’m ordinarily a pencil artist but my migraines can often prevent me from sitting up to draw on paper Same here I have my first and only ipad the M1 ipad pro and I’ll never upgrade it in my life I’ll keep using it as long as it works Just like ipad serves almost all my daily functions and requirements at the same time I don’t feel any need to change or upgrade it in future So I think that it was a well made investment and just hope it functions the way it does for many more years to come Mr WTB quotSmart toothbrushquotbrEditor 😈 I have a clip for that cause im a tech YouTuber I don39t care about your weddingnew homebusiness  just tell me about the tech i use a tablet for

If you just want to type notes watch videos use social media It39s ok to buy a tablet But when you want lots of resources CPU RAM upgrade RAM Van to cold up the CPU a tablet is not the one to buy I have apple watch o and a iPad Pro 2020 and a iPhone 12 mini and a make book 2020 and they all work great I use them all for different things like my Mack I use for photo shop and illustrator and video editing as it39s better and quicker on a make but editing photo I do on my iPad and taking photos and messaging I do on my phone and gaming I do on my phone and iPad and my watch I use to track my steps and sleep and use \\uf8ff pay on it to I just think app le do thing other companies do but a year or more later then them but they release it later to make it better apple products are the best product ever Almost there to catch up with MKBHD in terms of subscribers 🍏 🐑🐑🐑 As long as these run iPadOS just iOS in disguise I ain39t getting near that thing As someone who wants to switch over to an iPad for the thinness and streamlined apps I don’t do anything power intensive I was interested in getting the 13” Then I saw the prices At that price point just get a MacBook Chanel is getting boring now he should go back to the basics Tablets are worthless for me bro a laptop is already a filthy casual a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a caught me off gaurd tho 😂 How is quotthinquot even a selling point anymore Its not 2015 Tech influencers trying to convince you that “this new ipad is different” I39d rather get a gaming computer  Honestly everything Apple is overpriced Cause it’s your job and forbrClicks… Gotta pay the bills somehow 😂 3600 dollars either buy a stupidly fast and wasted energy on an iPad or on a stupidly heavy smart scuba gear so basically it39s a laptop with a detachable monitor that becomes a touch screen Your review makes me the 2024 iPad feel like it is a brand new product and the M1ampM2 older iPads didn’t exist beforebrbrAlso all the accessories people bought can’t work with the 2024 iPad Remember sitting on a tablet and having it broken screen afterwards When you sit on this laptop it will probably evaporate xD 1 Because you have shitload of disposable moneybr2 Because you gonna earn back on the views and marketingbr3 Because you are apple fanboybr4 Out of sheer curiosity to see how it fares short and long term Mostly because it will bring you enough views Made the same decision you did for similar reasons  Will be selling my MBP 14 and old iPad Pro a god gaming pc is 2000 how is a iPad 3600  Waste of money The iPad pro is certainly amazing however Apple themselves will tell you that their “pro” devices iPad Pro Macbook Pro and Mac Pro aren’t meant for everyonebrbrMost can get away with the lower end devices like the Air iPad and Macbook or iMacMac Mini… brbrOne thing I’ve noticed a lot with technology is that people are really sold on the marketing specifically that of Potential… If only someone could magic a way to load MacOS onto the iPad Bc you39re rich and this is a fun purchase looks like this will run mac os and ios i still use iphone 6 from 2014 hasn39t bent Soa macbook keyboard sold separately Are they really making the M4s debut in an iPad The most Apple thing to do with this new release is making the existing product lines incompatible The new Pencil looks great but won39t work with the 6th Gen Pro and the Magic Keyboard finally having that function key row  But not working with any of the previous models It39s quite frustrating but very typically Apple I39ll keep using their stuff though it lasts a long time and is powerful cries in wanting new stuff because it39s new Mrwhosetheboss spent lots of hours just to let us know about the iPad pro Just look at his windows Amazing For the first time the video felt a little biased towards apple I mean a very small can39t stress this point enough a really really small amount of people carry a laptop alongside a pad that feels like paper but isn39t The new ipad seems a great product for digital artists or people working around similar professions The airtag is thinner and definately constitutes a device Yeah no Look I am buying a 12 inch one to replace my 2018 iPad Pro but 3600 on this thing is absolutely brain dead I had a apple pencilbri have no clue where it is now i lst it somewhere Honestly this is robbery at this point You almost have ME convinced and I still use my Samsung Galaxy Tab A from like 2015 precisely BECAUSE of price  I am eagerly looking forward to the indepth follow up review Do what I did I replaced my Samsung tablet with a second hand iPad Air 4th gen that I found in perfect condition for 270 usd on eBay I am loving this thing it flies and just makes my previous Samsung S7 which is two years newer feel like a dinosaur As someone who entire dumped the MacBook line once the iPad Pro and magic keyboard was released… this was the future I saw early and jumped on and have not regretted it once Welcome to the club Yet you still need Mac or windows to download certain things I39m exactly on the opposite side Bought an iPad Pro a couple of years ago and sold it 5 months later I already have a smartphone AND a laptop AND a Mac Mini 0 need for an iPad I39d only switch if they add MacOS but I doubt it39s ever going to happen You are gonna be very disappointed thinking this will replace your Mac  It is terrible to actually do productive stuff with  Great for Youtube and Netflix  Not great for much else Nothing about that ipad is a 39redesign39 Nothing In 6 months quotWhy I am returning my IPad Proquot You don39t really need it nobody quotneedsquot it and you certainly don39t need the top spec maxed out version but It39s around one day of income for you It39s the equivalent of a regular person paying £150 for something Having used an iPad for the last three years I can assure you that I will never buy an apple tablet again This whole video is you convincing yourself to push the buy button  I have this exact same conversation with  friends and family before I buy a tech toy I don39t need  but quottotally needquot  P   Love your videos So this is basically a video of Arun trying to decide whether he should buy the new ipad pro or not🤦🏻\\u200d♂️ Because it39s a tax write off Please do video about samsung a55 Pls  mi aipad mini pliiis me imim I39m wondering how much apple pays for this advert Worlds most powerful Youtube and Netflix machine Damn I could have used that 3600 better lol Just because because the cost price of entry into ipad pros is higher doesn39t mean it39s overpriced brThey are 10x better than Android tablet trash such as the galaxy tabs who try to charge the same prices without even being half as good  brApple is giving TWO OLED panel display and M4 without even raising the starting price had it been gimmicky Android guys they would overcharge the heck out of it brTake the galaxy fold for example wait untill they drop the m4 comp He is evil god no if an app directs me to an app instead of a website that39s the quickest way to get me to return it that means it has tons of features locked down that should be part of it and it won39t let you make it work with other things which it should be able tobrbrnot to mention it also means they39re going to charge you more after the facts because they still have control over your device and how you use it instead of you Buy samsung s9 ultra and compare them please iPad screen ratio is not design for watching video and iPad doesn39t have full MS suite features MacBook has both advantages a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt236356a I39ll take it off your hands if you don39t need it my guy As an Android user Samsung  Motorola what killed the tablets for me was the desktop modes DeX  Moto Connect in the flagship lines S  Edge I use it daily since 2019 The smartphones become Chromebooks You just lost a bunch of credibility with this video… how much did Apple pay you for this I mean I guess if you don’t work on your own videos anymore but just because they have an iPad Final Cut I still don’t think it can replace my Mac And i know that you don’t genuinely think so either Bro what kids will still make it look like they found it in the toilet Imagine spending 3600 just to watch skibbidi toilet What game is that though That39s a lot of money for Peyton to spend on babysitting devices for Skylar Anhalo and Thaddeus i couldnt handle those smudges and that big touch screen a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt67107a Poor vision Best reason for an iPad With a decent back I bet it will feel more substantial BTW ever visit an Apple facility Way more people of color in their advertising who noticed him using his smart toothbrush Looks like a bit of a stumble to me I39m sorry how much I guess I39m not the only one who is tired about the TABLET  LAPTOP quotconspiracyquot why can39t I touch stuff on my MacBooks screen what happened to those amazing touchscreen laptops from back in the day they are just forcing us to buy 2 different devices when what we all need is a tablet like the new iPad m4 but able to handle all the software that comes for the laptop world brbrIn that specific case I wouldn39t feel robbed when getting the expensive keyboard or an expensive pen rightbrbrToo conservative they could do it brI know all they care is revenew but are they doing the math right Ya something so slim And you know you39re going to put a case on itbrMakes it kinda pointless Limited to one user     ugh Xiaomi pad 6 I have no interest in this product and still watched it great work Don39t switch jet wait for the next generation Arun when are u getting married quotthe one thing that i really struggle to wrasp is tablets  i take this remarkable writing tablet with me almost wherever i goquot because you have the money I almost bought the Galaxy tab S9 to figure it out the S10 date will be announced in the summer I39ll wait but I don39t want to spend a lot of money for unnecessary extra39s the tablet will be with Idk what will be but I have my hopes up Also waiting for accessories for that tablet will be long The wallpaper they use when advertising the new iPads looks like abstract Dynamic Islands So for 3 times the cost of a superior galaxy tablet that does more better quality and doesnt insist upon itself you can get the ipads answer to that and then spend more to get the inferior pen So the iPad air is pointless DIYPerks theyapple stole your double OLED idea sue them 😂 I agree on every point but Can I run my own code On pc it39s easier to pirate stuff So if I39m going the legal route I get lesser of a service because I ohmygaaaawd maybemaybe PiRaTe StUfF I rather pirate and get unrestricted access whenever wherever I still own a 2016 iPad and just pulled the trigger on the 11in These tablets last long and will stay with you a long time i still have a 2013 ipad The iPad Pro could basically be a Macbook replacement if using multiple apps simultaneously was implemented better Whether you39re talking about slideover split screen or stage manager iPadOS still has some problems with which app is 39active39 When watching a video and taking notes at the same time it still happens way too often that the keyboard refuses to type into the notes app but types into the browser instead Stuff like that make it sometimes completely unusable If they fixed that it39d be damn near perfectbrbrSelecting text is also quite fussy even with a trackpad It39s just less precise than on a Mac somehow They over designed it with fancy animations and it just doesn39t feel goodbrbrBut it39s really close Much closer than most tech reviewers seem to suggest The OS is really nearly identical to MacOS nowadays really  when using Stage Manager in particular iPad is basically the same as Mac Except for those active window bugsbrbrIt39s mostly some poweruser apps that are missing But then again you do get a lot of very polished apps back in return Imagine spending a pc worth of money on a tablet just to find a kid watching yt kids on it can i have one jk Because you have money 😜 Don’t buy Just go to the

web development still better than spending 3500 on the vision pro God I love watching Apple people try to justify Apple products i love ipads but WHY would u spend 3600 on one when u can get an M3 max MacBook Pro that has like 45x the power Watching this on my BRAND NEW Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra Price 161999 watched the Apple iPad event on my Samsung Galaxy smart Monitor 43quot Price 59999 WATCHING APPLE EVENTS ON MY SAMSUNG GALAXY DEVICES Price PRICELESS😅😂😅😂 i feel sorry for samsung the father of tablet39s with a free Smart pen and oled since 2014 yet they never get any praise Is this video sponsored by apple Only issue with the ipad is that you cant use it to do what a computer can do which defeats the whole purpose of the thing Just put a video editing software on it and allow it to be able to code and you would have the most amazing machine alas one that would also compete with apple39s own other lineup namely the macbooks so they dont do it I would never be able to replace my Macbook with an Ipad until  the day the full iOS gets on the pad till then the computer is worth the heft This is the start of the title quotMacbook Killerquot ¡Erria just following samsung ways  some apps will work better on the tablets  but quotprocessor contractsquot prevents them to use better CPUsGPU      ps Tandem OLED exists since 2014 its nothing new  but a very expensive way of putting more brightness per pixel  mantaining temperature and efficiency Because you have too much money to spend to create YT videos D I really dont know why its such a shock There are apps now that take advantage of the ipad pro I have the second gen of it I use Procreate Adobe Illustrator and Nomad 3D And honestly Im on it more than i am my desktop Its super powerful productive and portable I dont know when i would need an M4 processor Not once has it choked or bogged down So although its exciting I dont need it yet Which is nice to know Desktops get bogged down much quicker Oh and I make choice not to use it for entertainment Its a workhorse First world problems This video theme is fire 🔥🔥🔥 The feel of an iPad with the keyboard and track pad does often feel like a Mac But after a short time of using iPadOS I still find myself rushing back to my Macbook iPadOS is still the major drawback You can get a fully kitted out 14quot MacBook Pro for 700 less  PLEASE HEART THIS Imagine an iPad as expensive as the most powerful consumer end pc in the world The amount of effort put into this video is amazing Arun glad to see your opinion on the new iPad Pro which I feel everyday how you do about Mac and IPad It’s not the computing power it is the Software that doesn’t let it become a laptop replacement And there is no reason for Apple to let this hindrance go away to cannibalise its Macbook sales As a student I would not care about 10K multi thread score and fanciest ML capabilities when I can’t even use Excel and Word’s full versions and it is way too expensive and overkill for simple note taking and studying Simple I worked as an intern in a skin clinic where we used the iPad Pro 6th gen for basically everything from documenting to taking very sharp before and after pictures And thinking about wanting that same system for myself when I have my own clinic and comparing the specs from that iPad to the new one I think I still might go with the 6th gen The price is cheaper still more expensive than I would like for an iPad and specs wise the 6th gen would benefit me more Perhaps if the battery life is increased with the new one I might contemplate getting the new one but for now I39m still going for the 6th gen Also why is there one microphone less on the new one And removing the ultra wide lens what is that about ill enjoy my galaxy tab s9 ultra Is it mebut it seems like he just found out that you can get an iPad that uses a SIM card I wonder if he knows you can also buy laptops use a SIM card too Chrome books android tablets etc Absolute Waste of Money They could just have attached the screen to MacBook and make it detachable wtf It blows my mind that people fall for dumb products that look amazing This guy is just an advert nowadays Apple just trapping people in their pathetic ecosystem looting money And the question left unanswered  Bro image buying a a pencil when the slogan is bring new pencil experiance like bro what does that mean The iPad isn’t worth it IMO The UI is not good enough I saw Samsung ad on this video Sorry but still it39s no full Notebook like experience It39s just Ipad OS I bought an iPad Pro 3 years ago when my mac laptop died and I use it daily There are some things I like about it but many things that require me to use my Mac Mini via JumpVNC It is 2024 and we still don39t have XCode for IPad Fingers crossed the next update to iPadOS significantly improves things it39s a touch screen laptop a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt10751755a I use 128 GB on my PC 🥲 I feel that students thrive from iPad the most especially base model iPad it’s just so easy to write notes on Mac  would be best for college and work in my opinion anyway if you’re worried about BendGate 20 just make sure you don’t carry your iPad around in your back pocket Should be fine I mean this isn39t a good look lol I want it To answer the title of the video Because you can 🤷\\u200d♂️ I just bought the iPad Pro 6th generation AND NOW THIS COMES OUT LIKE BRO WHAT WHY RIGHT AFTER At least now you can write it off as a business expense lol a 13 inch tablet for the price of a really good gaming pc Good luck with that one For half the price you could buy a mid range laptop with a GPU instead The fact this is more expensive than the vision pro is absolutely mental brAnd it pains me to know that it39s only being used to watch Skibidi toilet on youtube It’s only the maxed out specifications of the iPad Pro only when it’s maxed out it cost as much as a Vision Pro Your channel is much better than MKHBD I added every bell and whislte and could not get to the 3600 figure But why would you need to add all those things to watch YouTube videos on your iPad This is no please no dont swap your laptop for tablets The amount of programs you can no longer download the amount of games you can no longer play how can you possibly sit there and say app games are better The hell Even using mac instead of Windows is criminal for a tech guy Why you spent Because you39re a multimillionaire and 3600 to you is the equivalent of most of us finding a quarter in the couch cushions I use an iPad air 2 and it39s indispensable ipad os is very underrated if you have an ipad leave social media youtube behind for a while find something else to do with it and you39ll start to see the value I have fixed it twice already and with it helping me with work it39s also paid itself off I have my eyes set on one of the older iPad pros with the home button on it they39re still good and they still run ios 17 Nothing screams rich or stupid like a 3600 dollar iPad Let39s be honest he just wanted a touchscreen MacBook So i dont need a laptop anymore woooow Answer of title because I dumb 😂😂 Because you make 20k from every video you release Thats why Watching it like I can afford it 🤡 I just want a new iPad mini with at least M1 chip Don’t really need a big iPad might as well carry my MacBook instead Also iPad Pro with new keyboard and pen cost way too much and there is no need for a iPad Air lol honestly tablets should be under 300 dollars If i get 10k likes Arun will buy me the same ipad The iPad is a device that would be great to use if it was a 2 in 1 laptop The iPad has only one non thunderbolt USBc port and the RAM is too inadequate for development not to mention no way to build apps I am simple I need ram Intergrating any apple device in your life makes things more complicated Sticking to pc android and google workspace is way better Apple is just scamming people all the time It39s still severely limited by IOS This is one of the reasons I got a Surface Pro I wanted the portability of a tablet with a pen that was still a good productivity computer Since the Surface Pro uses an actual computer OS I39ve had no issues with it Granted Windows link with the phone isn39t the bestbrbrI would find it interesting if he did a longterm review of a Surface Pro vs the new iPad Would that even be a fair comparison Until iPads can play audio from two apps at the same time they are not ready to replace laptops You would be paying more money for an iPad Pro than for a MacBook Air for a more powerful processor but unable to take advantage of that extra powerbrbrHere39s hoping Apple updates iPad OS soon No iPads are not Macbooks No matter how much apple try to convince us iPad OS is in

that it’s not compatible with the M1 iPad Pro… brbrWhen they mentioned Zbrush I was like no way I like how your videos have got I think more serious and less frenetic over the last year or so a

mindblowing the stuff Apple is allowed to get away with How stupid can people be Really quotWhy I spent 3600 on the iPad Pro M4quot because you got dollars stacked up through your roof I would never in my life spend this much on a tablet that isn39t even a real pc Will it run next gen Crysis Very excited to upgrade my old M1 iPad Pro which I paid almost 2000 for and have only used to watch YouTube and Netflix 😇 And that temporary effort in art on procreate and affinity iPad can never replace a laptop if you can39t run fullfat software and are limited to the App store Now if Apple lets you do full on development ie gives you full Unix functionality Terminal ability to install IDEs use the file system install any software from anywhere on the internet then it39s a true replacement I39ll wait for your recap and revisit I’m disappointed they didn’t just make the bezels much thinner if even at all Would’ve been nice if they did and kept the footprint the same to be compatible with the previous magic keyboards Where is mrwhosetheboss did he move house If you are an editor  a music maker a gamer who plays games that have really realistic graphics it’s a good idea Go to iPad Pro but if you are a person that needs something for school probably a good idea togo with the iPad Air if you’re just a casual Joe who doesn’t really need a big iPad but you still want something for Notes go with the iPad mini or if you want you can always get a refurbished iPad If you didnt watch heres the summarybrbrIf you39re rich and love apple buy the new ipad The current iPad Pro is already very thin The difference in thickeness between the last gen and this ipad is 13mmbriPad Pro 129quot  64mmbriPad Pro 13quot     51mm Wait Are we gonna ignore that he mentioned about him getting married Congrats 👏 Nope Not hoing to ‘I’m an 8TB guy’ 😂 Me too Just can’t afford it When I think of Jerry rig everything I’m thinking this is up his alley No MacOS for 3600 Mrwhosetheboss gave spoiler of moving to a new home so new studio tour video is coming soon I got a apple ad lol I still feel the S9 Ultra is a way ahead of this I own an iPad pro gen 3 and it is basically an iPhone experience on steroids but you don39t have the same flexibility as a laptop because you are restricted to apps that are available on ipad it39s great but you can39t utilise the M4 processor at all Tbh I have a first gen iPad Pro with a logitech folio keyboard case and a gen 1 apple pencil along with a 2018 Mac Pro and I have tried bluetooth mice with my Ipad when I39m at home cause the folio case has a keyboard but no trackpad and when Im at college and tbh the Mac just works all the time I constantly feel like oooo maybe the iPad will be better since it has a good keyboard better than my mac cause the 2018 mac has a shit keyboard and it can draw which can sometimes be useful when copying stuff off the teachers board but tbh the mac just works better as an all in one If you need to do work processing it is just better and the cursor because it is designed for touch is just simply less accurate and i constantly find myself using my finger when i have bought my iPad to college instead of my mac which is very annoying when you have clammy hands or you have just eaten The new iPad Pro looks good but from my experience nothing beats the simplicity of a Mac it will always just work and seems to have a much better battery life too But that is just my experience I think Apple wants you to think that it could replace your Mac in order to try and get you to buy an iPad Pro but it just simply can39t  they want you to double up on a Mac and iPad but it just isn39t a replacement Its one of them things which you think would be a good idea but isn39t Its kinda a decision you have to experience for yourself since I know for some it can be a replacement but even my mate who has an iPad Pro and Mac agrees Petition for Arun to get the Pura 70 ultra Why do you keep bringing your wedding into the tech videos That39s literally 5000 Canadian 😵\\u200d💫😵\\u200d💫😵\\u200d💫 Oh boy watch when jerryrig get his hands on that 😂 They can keep it This crap is for entertainment My S23 Ultra works great for mobile and nothing apple provides outofbox will handle my workload this is what a biased yt channel look like Rich folk devices many people struggle to pay for groceries Ill start by saying i bought an iPad pro M1 about a couple of years ago and haven’t touched my MacBook pro since Its an amazing product Surfing the net watching YouTube and i dont mind watching Netflix and such on it actually enjoy it a lot That being said i would take a closer look at apps that you plan to use Im a designer amp a photographer and the main programs that you would want the app versions are not up to par For example The Photoshop app is a joke Its useless as a professional tool and infuriating considering the amount of money they want for in their subscription I looked long and hard to try to find a good alternative and found one affinity photo What PS should be on ipad but there was a long learning curve… its hard teaching an old dog new tricks😂 I will say lightroom is totally good enough as a professional tool on ipad My personal opinion is that if the apps were full versions as in desktops i would never touch a laptop again The ipads are super intuitive and fun Its 999brStop trying to shame apple by choosing their highest specs which is will end up being around 2399 even with the nano glass and 2TB storage you spend it because you have the money to buy it or you may get it for freewho else buys a ipad for 3600 You really seem to have had very low expectations of current tablet technology Would never spend that kind of money on a tablet or even a laptop Answer you39re an isheep we all know how much you love apple and all their revolutionary products Hot but imo bad take It39s still an iPad as soon as you actually see the current software limits and experience the throwback compared to the macbook you39ll probably at least miss the mac i was the same when they put an M1 chip in the iPad pro ultimately they are never going to make your iPad a laptop or a MacBook Because it effects their bottom line The Ipad39s are held back solely by apple themselves They will always be big phones or small on the go entrainment devices Just hoping it’s not another note 7 situation You can fix your storage issue with a nas system Basically your own cloud It can39t replace a laptop I39ll say it again Wake me up when I can run docker and compile programs on an iPad Pro Watching this on my iPad I can39t justify upgrade to this device when I can39t fine a reason to use my current iPad pro Ipad is not for programmers I love this guy but this sounds like a LOT of copium

the words in the world to promote it but for that money only brainwashed apple fanboys will buy it I39ve been wanting to dip my toes back into the apple eco after being in google for ages but one of the big downsides for me in a tablet form is that I use my tablet to read on an app that is android exclusive MF god scammed I absolutely do not prefer an app when a webpage will suffice The browser

fanboy but every quality in the realm of quotlaptop replacementquot on this New ipad was done better in the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra And still they just cant make calculator app Anyway it is amazing new toy Enjoy 🍀🍀🍀 I never understood why people want to swap their wellbuilt laptops for tablets with keyboards It39s not better You can get 360 foldable touchscreen ultrabooks for sub2000 It39s like reinventing the wheel Yeah it is capable enough but what does it do what a Laptop can do Except or artists Where do I do complex excel tasks Where do I run VM to run other stuff like poweBI  Except for multimedia consumption thats it It kind of sucks to look at a powerful and beautiful device but it can39t do anything I will keep my MacBook pro 14 361TB  for now  was thinking of returning for the ipad but it just cant be used enough When a 1 TB  ipad with only 16gb of ram costs the same as my MacBook and does WAAYYYY LESS Yeah I also prefer that You can buy a car high end gaming pc three 55 inch oled tvetc for 3600 dollars Apple is living in fantasy land with the current economy no body can literally afford their products anymore 😂 I kinda miss the funny parts of your Videos It feels more and more like a documentation not a Youtube Video One thing about the Remarkable is that using it is a distractionfree experience You39ll lose that with the iPad Yoooo So I love your videos But…did Apple pay you to make this video You are tech king you and Marques but…everything you are wowing over isn’t new I have the M1 Pro and all of the features you are wowing over have been in place since then Except for the function keys And then sure the M4 is super fast but why There is literally nothing that uses that power There aren’t even apps that use the potential of my M1 Mac Try actually editing a video with Final Cut luma fusion or Resolve It’s horrible No plugins and you will be frustrated and go back to your Mac I’m an Apple fanboy but your review of this iPad is almost 4 years out of date I’m tired of the “it needs to run MacOS” crowd… they just need to keep improving iPadOS and bring over more pro apps Many good points made in this video  My M2 Pro is still overkill… the camera placement is actually enough for me to sidegrade dropping down from 129 back to 11 since the screens are the same  video calls and meetings are an allday affair for me so that’s hugebrbrWallet stings for a second… here’s hoping WWDC helps justify it even more I love your vids keep it up Look forward to the followup video Hey Aaron can you please test the Samsung Galaxy tab s9 Ultra Please and thank you if you do🙂 I39m more of an iPad mini person For me that 83quot thing is the bridge between doing stuff while on the move on my phone and doing actual work on my 13quot MBP People watching this on the ipad pro m4 fully maxed out I would have  preferred a  smaller and faster iPad  over thinner I guess I will have to wait for iPad mini pro 😢 I really like the new iPad but man I must tell you I absolutely love the Shirt you are wearing Where can I buy it lol I think they just put everything into their iPads cuz they have money and for will Can people please just stop talking about it Why is there a gun inside of my iPad AYOOOOO that smart toothbrush scene needed to be edited out haha lawd have mercy I am still using an samsung galaxy tab s6 lite from 2022 and I must say that for me its more than enough  Calling someone apple fanboy is the most npc thing ever Let us keeep it very simple This is an overhyped device If you really need an ipad get the air 39I39m an 8TB kind of guy39brbrLooks at my 256 GB 🤣 Is it just me or it kinda feels like Arun has gotten a bit serious in his videosbrJust a doubt I already have iPad pro and apple pencil M2 i don’t think i need this one I might sound stupid now but why can39t I use an iPad as a phone P I really want a bigger phone with good battery life The iPad could be just that Probably looks stupid when I39m using an iPad to pay for thingswell nothing is perfect D But the 109 inch iPad or the magic keyboard I see you love that toothbrush 😮 My dad always tells me he wants an ipad pro but knows nothing of the hardware or software He just likes the screen size lol absolutely never getting him a pro model just to watch youtube and browse facebook Hes faired just fine with the standard model from a few years back My guess iPad revenue will continue to decline yoy Most families bought many devices already during COVID with inflation and high price like this iPad I don39t see massive people coming out to upgrade unnecessary brbrWatching this on Galaxy tab 9 ultra which cost less than 500 when I bought it works awesome For your storage get Linus from LTT to make you a NAS system If you drop it  screen replacement will cost 10k So scummy to make a new tablet which looks exactly like the old one but takes only a new redesigned magic keyboard which looks exactly like the old one and a new pen etcapple really maxed out on how to rerelease items to sell it again for profit just waiting for all the breaks due to the thinness of this waayyy overpriced apple stuff once again How did the Apple Pencil feel on the nano texture screen compared to the ReMarkable 2 Laptops are for producing iPads are for consuming You cannot generate anything useful from an iPad The fact it doesn39t have file support makes it absolutely useless Add as many colors flowers rainbows as you want but still will never be as useful as a PC until they solve the file system issue a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt42042a Arun we see what you did there 🧐 No floating not even tiling windows It39s still useless and it will not replace a computer 2800£ iPad 64GB  400 Keyboard 300 Pen 😮 Reading anything is superior on the tablet but doing work is still great on laptop I haven39t tried typing a whole paper on tablet lately I always thought the hybrid with detachable tablet is a great idea  but hasn39t been perfected I don’t see why apple doesn’t combine the macbook air and ipad pro basically making a lenovo yoga allowing you to fold the keyboard back and adding a touchscreen I39ll be living vicariously through you brother because there is no way in hell that I39m paying 3600 for an iPad normal people should wait and see what new capabilities can be done before they spend that kind ofmoney …to be honest seems like a routine spec bump Hardware is top notch but they need to up the OS Can you delve deeper into exploring integration in professional settings we are entering a new era of desktophybrid devices ipadkeyboard setup is a new imac You can get really decent gaming laptop for that kinda money Not worth it since base 10th gen ipad or ipad air can do the same way cheaper and plus they might as well market it as a macbook air replacement im watching this on a ipad air 3 the real answerbrbecause you are STOOOOBID guys i own an imac from 2017 which works pretty good but i need a portable device so what should i get between the ipad pro 13 inch and the macbook air 15 inch considering i own an imac Answering the question because you have to make this video 3600 😂😂😂 this guy is so god damn fake I did this transition from macbook to iPad in 2020 iPad Air  Pencil  Magic Keyboard but came back running for a mac in 2022 because iPadOS sucks so much Good luck though To answer the question in the title It39s because he39s rich and he can So we got a foldable iPad now If I imagine what this money could buy me a super powerfull number crunching LaptopWorkstation for AI Dev and Computer Vision I get absolutely dizzy I have a doubt As a lot of smartphones these days are performing better than Apple why can’t Apple put their fastest chips M2M4 etc in their phones to make them the fastest Really makes me wonder why they haven’t put macOS on iPad What39s that saying A fool and their money are easily parted The apple pencil for me is the biggest piss take Use ya fingers way cheaperbrbrAlso the Ipad at this point is an outdated overpriced gimmick I see no point to them at all apart from when people give it to the kids to watch peppa pig on youtube Also almost £3000 with a pencil and keyboard The mark ups from what it cost them to make to selling no wonder they make a bazillion quid year on year Just because it has a powerful chip doesn39t mean it can do everything It doesn39t even have the same passive heat dissipation system of MacBook because no apps can utilize the SoC at full potential This thing only allows short bursts of calculationprocessing for a short period of time Also ipas os limits how much background apps it can run at the same time unlike macOS without any limitations Apps also need to use less memory because only certain types of apps can utilize much at a timebrbrIt should be like surface 2in1 detachable screen laptop I mean simply a MacBook or Mac pad with full performance but then how could apple sell more devicesbrbrHence they39re trying everything to limit it and make a different product linebrWant something to write Get an ipad Want something to do exclusive processing Get a MacBook brbrSo basically users are most likely to buy both devicesbrbrbrI am waiting for the snapdragon based 2in1 detachable laptop which can solve this issue once and for all Maybe Microsoft could39ve done better if not killed android apps support With that they could39ve provided better touch screen apps many android apps now work with foldabletablet UI due to scaling capabilities like a desktop app There39s also an app window resize features like freeform windows Meanwhile…brbrJerryRigEverything bcracks knucklesb Well this will be fun 😈 Wow you can see how much effort you put into your videos just by looking outside at the start of the video it was day and at the end it was night Respect🫡 Isn’t only 1200 dollars Thank you for supporting Apple People like you make ever increasing dividends possible for us shareholders Thank you Bc you’re insane Bros funding the iPad purchase with this video😂👏 Hes already made 4500 from the video 😂 therelaxingwonders stonks

tech video channel is wrong Remember the new M4 chip is for longevity apple planned about this device it will basically be updated after prolly M7 He already did more than a million views already 😂and counting Yep This Apple shill I find these millionaire youtubers crying over the cost of devices they want to buy really annoying aliciafoxxxy7943no lower I don’t think he makes that much per video Most overrated channel on this entire platform 😂😂😂 Bro ‘bought’ the iPad for this video blueig1 when you don’t say anything better to not make it This video is the most useless video published today on the whole youtube dspigs0705Well you’re here watching it as well 😂 Oh he totally did this video probably wasn’t high budget either since it’s him sitting in one place talking for 15 min with cuts here and there aliciafoxxxy7943 those numbers are bs H prob makes 80k Apps for phones n tablets are light versions of real applications that run on Computers Apps are overrated and destroying the net just like advertising w tons of CRAP aliciafoxxxy7943 Good for him cristibaluta lmfao 3 millons views is what like only 510k jamaharon3 Million views would come to about 90000 according to LinkedIn Is it smart to replace my 2017 MacBook Pro with this iPad Pro 11inch with the keyboard and pen I am planning on doing it and it’s very expensive Just another expensive useless thing It39s funny because the M4 chip is so powerful but iPad OS could never tap into the full power of it My Tab S9 Ultra doesn39t have a chip anywhere near as powerful as the M4 BUT I can run as many apps open at once while Apple can do like 3 tops The Spen is included and the button on the Spen functions more than just a drawing tool This Video feels like its made by an Tec Addict that need a few reasons to buy just another Tec Thing that he can throw into the corner after a few days of using lul My desktop pc for gta 6 is 1300… Bink and the iPad Pro used to cost 600  900 These YouTube influencers iNORMALIZINGi 3600 for an iPad is disgusting This is not simply about influencers This is about corporate greed labor rights and high cost of housing rent insurance utilities and taxes The more we bend over and take it up our butts the more our overlords will give it to us If you change your hand held device can you send me your remarkable I love to use it for my tech trainings and use it as my go to device for notes taking I mean only if you can Let me know if you are interested to give away your remarkable device to me and we can connect in a private channel over how it can be shipped Meanwhile I follow your videos frequently and some of them truely give good info to buyers over their decision making on buying a device or not and about its quality and features i39m an 8TB kinda guyme watching this with my 256GB MacBook sobs beek gaye hai gorment I mean I can download a App for Netflix and Amazon Prime and download Videos through them but maybe that is a Windows thing So they reinvented a laptop but worse This is such a good insight to knoww Phil would have definitely got it ignoring the cost of Small critique but maybe the font size on the iPad could have been set higher because it’s hard to read a lot of what’s on the screen intro I can already imagine the wedding quotMrwhosetheboss do you take this iPad to be your wife to live together in matrimony to love her to honor herquot For a moment I was afraid that You spend that money because you have the money 😂  The even better news is that the visualizations and addons for this video it will make much more money🎉  So why not Anyway nice video and analysis Takes about 5 minutes of research and maths to say that the M4 is about 25 faster than the M3brM3 was about 20 faster than M2 M4 is about 50 faster than M2brbr12M2x15M2brx15M212M2brx125 If Apple can improve iPadOS at WWDC then the iPad would become an easy replacement for many people39s Macs Without an OS improvement the iPad is objectively worse than the Mac Don’t buy iPad Pro base model come with 9 processors 1T byte come with 10 processor apple is ripping off ppl 😢😢😢 Would love to hear what you think about the textured glass decision after living with it for a bit People made a big deal out of the Steam Deck OLED doing this and how it would affect contrast and that ended up being effectively a nonissue The iPad appears to have a much more matte finish though I just saw the title and I was like maybe you have a channel on YouTube that you review them🤭 You said last year you had the other device to sort of free yourself from the device that can do “everything”… so what’s changed Consider carefully when getting iPad If you getting iPad don’t YouTube on it cause your iPhone also do YouTube Most of it sounds like copium You can do it all on the M1 ipads minus most of the costs Nice contrasting perspective to MKBHD39s view that powerful tablets are unnecessary Ur a multimillionaire big vro You know it’s not really gonna matter 3600 to you is 360 to most ppl and that’s being conservative But I get your point in a sense since you are trying to make a YouTube video and that creates a more compelling story Besides niche use cases the price it is not justified a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt184304a iPad bought in Rome Italy Cellular connectivity on the iPad is incredible especially for 20 a month… Remember the MS surface pro 10 years ago And the new one has the pen inside the cover 2700 all in With core i7 i also use a smart toothbrush Bro what do you do on 8 tb ☠️ Isn39t it weird all ipads still only have 12mp Camara So I decided to stick to Windows 🙂 When you want wool from sheep Cos you can afford it easily I39m curious what the durability of that nanocoating will be like Wouldn39t a better solution be to get a matte screen protector Much easier to replace ifonce it wears out With the launch of the new iPads we can expect the prices of the last gen to be slashed So can you make a video on if we should go for the iPad Pro M2 or iPad Air M2 No terminal 💩💩 needs macos to be worth that Mrwhosetheboss or anyone else who can answer this question what MacBook would you recommend I buy I’m thinking of purchasing a MacBook for gaming and schoolwork so I want one that has lots of space very fast and can handle like high graphic high quality type games like HSR GTA5 or Roblox Any recommendations Apple sucks That is all Me rocking my 9th gen iPad I moved from ipad to Samsung due to the OS  Samsung OS is night and day ahead of ios I definitely do not love being redirected to an app I LIKE having ONE browser app as opposed to 1300 individual apps for every single thing I need access to Apple stopped innovating It39s sad I have the iPad Pro M1 with a Magic Keyboard and it isn’t iPadOS is sadly still the limiting factor in my opinion MacBooks are just much nicer to work on could two monitors be connected to it to use like a mini mac which is not yet with M4 chip Which sweatshirt are you wearing It looks really cool and nice Mrwhosetheboss Where is your jumper from    Dude  I guess this time you made a review on a very narrow user frame I guess most people don39t use ipads instead of their computers but together That makes sense for designers for sure but also for studying for making presentations reading making notes watching videos portably reading sheets on the piano  even as an extra screen close to the computer for productivity etc Nothing justifies a 3k tablet in my opinion but to reduce using possibilities of tablets to big phones or notebooks of the future is a bit narrow minded in my opinion I understand why you don39t think it is the best product for your routine but there are many ways in which tablets are useful on everyday life I carry my Ipad on a shouderbag almost everywhere I go No notebook or cellphone will cover that Repent and believe in the gospel of Jesus and you will be saved 😄 16mins of Arun convincing him self that is not a waste of money to have this tablet D Bro the iPad kids gonna be going wild😂 bro needs to get a chromebook I could tell you quotwhyquot but you tube would cancel me As Marqus said iPad is an iPad new Windows tablets are coming with more powerful ARM SoC I will rather wait When Apple decide to run MacOS in an iPad I may rethink Those look too thin in my opinion…i would rather them put more money into the build quality and durability to make it LAST Rather than cut out 5 ounces here and there Bro the way I see it the iPad is an overpriced gimmick and a failed alternative to a Laptop Like seriously all that M4 juice just to watch Netflix or play PUBG Now people will defend it by saying you can edit videos and photos on it with peak level of performance but that39s a very small usecase compared to what u get on a full fledged LaptopDesktop Like seriously what you39re gonna do with the M4 if it39s paired with the iPad OS can u run Blender on it or do high level coding or Machine Learning This would be great product only if they had provided full laptop level compatibility on the software side  rather than sticking 300 keyboard and trackpad Well that’s a bit harsh and the majority disagree  for certain people yes that is very true but in reality both have their benefits and disadvantages If you had an iPad and got used to it you might see the countless benefits but your core point is somewhat justified I am an iPad user though so I do mostly disagree with you kianandtheviolin I respect your opinion bro  you may be enjoying your iPad experience as it fully meets your usecase which may be true for the majority but the thing is that if I39m paying that much money in the name of Laptop Alternative or Laptop replacement then I expect it to be able do anything a laptop can even if it39s out of my usecase It39s the same logic why some software engineers tend to buy gaming laptops windows even if they don39t game that much Because as a developer or a designer it39s always good to have that power and capability in ur hand Otherwise just don39t sell it as a laptop replacement by putting a M4 level chip and charging 3000 sarthakshukla7217 Thanks for the respect It’s nice to know there’s not only strongly opinionated and stubborn people with opinions nowadays For developing of course the way to go is windows or mac because you aren’t making apps on an iPad XD  also it was mentioned in the video that most apps for iPad are better but I actually disagree with that in lots of cases and agree with you  like I do music tech and compose and although I have Logic Pro for iPad I am never going to replace my mac version with that Mac and Windows are just more versatile for highperformance use cases and unless you are on the go and use a lot of iPad apps MacWindows is definitely the way to go The iPad Pro is a device I carry with me all day and can do some but not all of what a laptop can do My MacBook stays docked on my desk connected to three external monitors and can do some but not all of what my iPad can do Meh And I have been a Pencil user It will always be shit For the masses the macbook air is probably the most utility per dollar you can get by spending on an Apple product iPad needs macos otherwise it is nothing more than a YouTube machine Well there are great apps built for iPad with more features on iPad Some sort of MacOS support would be good though  like maybe being able to sync it with your Mac account and be able to use a cut down version of MacOS two panels but OLED to post it on youtube and have adsense rain I watched on iPad We just need better apps more pro apps but even so  I39m very tempted Only recently been using a Remarkable2 It39s an Apple vs Orange comparison mate Remarkable is designed for a different universe 51K Why Rich person that39s why a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt476756a what happened to the camer you make very good video39s i like them a lot thanks This is basically me trying to justify my last buy that I do not really need 😄 The day I spend that much money on a tablet is the day I book myself into the looney bin seriously wtf is apple thinking Have you had a sneaky Apple sponsorship deal recently highly doubt you39ll replace a Mac with this def not for me “Cause I can” end of the video I usually think of my tablet as a basically infinite notebook I usually use it for drawing and taking notes in classes and it39s pretty good for that But as someone who39s learning IT I still need my laptop for programming and other heavier tasks I can39t see myself switching to a tablet even if there would be a similar quality android tablet iPad just doesn39t makes any sense for the professional use apart from graphic designers and 2D animators It39s file organisation system is very poor it doesn39t have nearly as many softwares a PC or MAC has It39s very restricted from every department as much as I initially hated on MAC for not being even near as pirate friendly or open to Windows I started appreciating the heck out of MAC after using the iPad On top of it it39s costs as much as a MacBook Really pointless his parents had to disown him by now BUT it is limited  to using iPad OS M2 Pro is still the best choice for average users I don39t like tables my arm gets tired holding them when I put it on my belly Notebooks don39t just fall over a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt434714a what is that game called 😅 Diablo immortal Cant wait for Jerry to Bend that thing in Half 😂😂😂😂😂 Apple junk wait till it goes on the Fritz then get ready to pay a chunk of change to repair it 😡 Did they manage to fix the static build up on the screen Still Ipad OS so you can39t edit like on your Mac why was he gawking on the tooth brush like that Just put macos on it Jesus I have an iPad Pro and I just don39t get the love for it Gaming laptop is better at everything besides YouTube Looks like you are making a good use case for yourself to buy one no salute at the end😝 still no calculator Apple  anticonsumer You know for 3600 you can a make a powerful pc Because you can afford it End of If you need storag just get a 2 Terabyte MicroSD™ and insert it into the extendable storage Can39t wait to pick one up for 500 in 3 years For an iPad seriously Still a ridiculously overpriced tablet which can never become a full on PC replacement Jerry Rig Everything be like quotI39ll have fun with this onequot pls make a vid on realme p1 pro Wow I think Apple is doing the Balenciaga strategy and testing how dumb their costumers are The only reason would be because you CAN buy one No other reason Who use Tablet nows a day Its a waste of money crazy how they all complained abt the price of apple vision pro but are happily paying this much for an ipad I39m hoping that nano coating will come to the iPhones Amazing how Apple manages to impress even when it was so obvious what they were bringing to the table I’m eager to see teardowns drop tests and bend test on this crazy thing and absurdly powerful device a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt22022a me when the soup is too hot because you are a rich youtuber and you dont give a fuck The surface pro left the chat Only The Apple nerds will only Buy this ipad Out of which 80Probably are Show offs Who are actually poorer 😂 At the same time Real CreatorsDesigners even if they own one doesn39t even use much Bcs the productivity experience what they have doesnt seems convenient for them to use With the same price they can do or buy better It’s not needed to be that thin and the battery could be 20 hours by adding a millimeter And i‘d put it in a case which has probably them same thickness as the tablet Did you try to bend it I suspect there will also be thermal issues as SRAM scaling is over So that’s the definition of a Tablet And this falling to the ground will be instant dead And also its still crippled by not having macOS it makes it not worth it again thats a perfect amount of slimness Now i can add a case without it being BULKY I39m cool with a phone and a MacBook pro Breaking a bone is cheaper than breaking the iPad That39s why my 13 yo cousin was crying BC she bent her iPad lol Love the sunset effects in the background oh  wait iGlad indeed What theres something comforting watching this while not being willing to upgrade to any post 2017 apple product true its interesting to see what the next generation of devices are capable of doing but 2017 tech is more than enough for current day to day use alexlun4464 yeah at some point theres no visible difference in performance to the average user and anyone who upgrades to a new device with features meant for pros will have to suffer from the sacrifices made for those pro features that they never were planning to use you can39t manage files that well on tablet as on pc Arun you are definitely one of my favorite tech reviewers but your presentations are above and beyond everyone else Thank you for your hard work and dedication To sum it up he’s rich You’re using the toothbrush wrong The amount of lies and contradictions this video has is disgusting Great vid👏👏keep it up Team Mrwhosetheboss💪 Because you are rich  No other reason I am watching this on a M1 iPad Pro Performance still snappy and oled screen still nice A used M1 iPad is 450 I’d totally recommend to anyone Bro just bought a Macbooh but worse I pretty much use my iPad Pro as a laptop and it works real well  I have a PC desktop that I use for everything else gaming development rendering etc  Wish I could justify getting the new iPad Pro but my old IPP is a tank and just won39t quit try using some of the windows surface products i for example habe a surface pro 7 and its basicly a tablet and laptop in one  not really expensive its great for school work Let me get this straight apple is good at iPads think again theres a lenovo thinkpad yoga thats better and it have anything like normal pc omg are you kidding me  How can people compare iPad to Macbook Oh yeah if you are only watching YT Plot twist Samsung makes Apple screens😂😂😂 Once I39ve heard a kid say quotmoney comes money goesquot You guys killed this review I watched over 20 and your review is by far the best great job Only got past the first 6 mins of this video but im kind of disappointed how sold Arun is on this overpriced tablet for people with disposable money  Apple has a way of making its current users think they need the next best thing “I’m a very exited man right now” Crazy how parents are gonna buy this just to give it to their toddler Ill save you the time its because he is rich…your welcome So pretty much like my iPad Air 4th Generation in terms of weights and portability If you are a software developer or need to work anywhere near that arena  iPads don39t cut it So you have to have both a MacBook Pro and an iPad Same goes for video editing  both Davinci Resolve and Final Cut Pro are crippled on the iPadbrThe iPad will never be a MacBook replacement for professionals And oh  also once you add the iPad keyboard  the combination becomes heavier than a MacBook Air If you have the money  then yeah knock yourself out But it still no where close to a serious device Better off with MacBook and the most cost effective iPad you can find  and it is still good enough to replace your electronic paper device That39s like 12 month of rent where i live omg im an artist and i know apple tablet are nice It39s just gonna be my another whishlist someday ill be so rich i will consider getting it   3600 usd is soo soo much God nerfed me with money cuz he knew I39d be unstoppable if i had such things lmao but hey 🥹🙏🏻 Americans are gonna like the M4 chip for sure Arun we are REALLY close to overtaking Apple in subscribers Just 300000 to gobrLet39s do this🎉🎉🎉 13quot iPad Pro with absolutely everything inclusive AppleCare pencil keyboard costs 4197 here in Sweden Outrageous Apple knows kids are growing up with iPads the same way our parents grew up with Walkmans and desktops the same way we grew up with laptops and smartphones These are not for us but for the next generation of consumers Money simple Why are your videos dark now Now I am guarantee getting the iPad 13inch pro 🎉 after this video apple needs to discontinue either the macbook or the ipad they are just running out of reasons to distinguish between the two migrate mac os to ipads or include touch screen functionality on a mac You know what would actually make the iPad a real deal breaker It would be if they added a desktop profile that behaves exactly like macOS kinda like saying quotI wish the iPad had both iPadOS and macOSquot Ever since the M1 ipad pro I39ve kinda been annoyed at how the thing looks like it could be Like A Laptop but it really isn39t  Stage Manager on M1 never seemed to quite work properly for me either Get ready to be disappointed as a laptop replacement the OS needs a serious update for a tablet to cost me so much it needs to do A LOT more especially already owning an iPad Pro there39s no reason at all to update still no mac exchange since file folder and management is still very bad a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a what that mouth do  Why Apples market cap is over 2trillion lol I would like to state that i dont like to see tablet drifting into the luxury market and apple seems to be pushing this more and more especially because they often underspec cheaper alternatives namely the normal ipad and they overcharge for the ipad air Sure it39s useful for videophoto editing or even documents But still pretty useless for software developers When Visual Studio comes out for it and lets me write full dotnet apps I may change my mind  For me it39s mostly just an entertainment device and doesn39t really need much power for that I have to say though that im not a big fan of too thin devices in a thicker one you could theoretically house bigger speakers a better cooling solution for the processor and a bigger battery plus you acheive far more stability I wouldn39t use it in a magic keyboard to be honest normally logitech builds high quality accessories but im a samsung tab user so what do i know When someone is so rich that you can39t relate if u wanna write just carry a notebook bruv and write on paper with a normal pen For us minority who use the Lidar a lot with apps like Recon3D and Sitescape the extra muscle is nice Also watching 3D models of complex buildings without staggering Did this man just use  mobile gaming  as an example of an improved gaming experiencebrbrlmaobrbrWe have different use cases but imo the mobile experience is almost never better than a desktop class app I own a regular Ipad and the only thing I prefer to do on it is draw with procreate  I would much rather edit photos research write design in CAD game or do pretty much anything on a big monitor and with a pc that is more powerful for half the cost than this Bendgate 2 Pro Sure if you have plenty of money to throw away and dont have that demanding of a workload the weight advantage is nice but used car money for a tablet is hilarious With all the accessories i suppose this overtakes the vision pro as the most expensive netflix machine Sorry you lost me when you praised how simple and quotbetterquot it was to photo edit on it but glossed over the 50 longer times to do super intensive things you know the kind of stuff you would want a MacBook for but want to replace with an iPad TLDW  he did it for the clicks on YouTube I don39t agree at all with the quotapps are better on mobile then on pcquot but I might not be the mainstream user that uses Apple stuff or even worse Windows Is no one still gonna mention the fact that the iPad Pro only has 1 camera instead of 2 Now internet I39m gonna expect you to be mature with a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt42042a and not do anything rash You are all better than that right The nice thing about the m macbooks you can already run the iPad apps Because you gonna return it right after the multiple videos you gonna make of it I tried the same but at the end the missing file explorer makes it hard for people who need it Why he says it39s better when a product asks you to use their app I actually hate that having to install a separate for every thing that i

Look like dolls eyesbrbrHas to be shot on a phone The pixel quality on phones isn39t good enough yet for this to look good or even acceptable Sorry brbrYou should probably stick with larger sensor dedicated video cameras I39ve got a 12 year old iPad and it still works perfectly They are great things  and the screen is still brilliant Imagine getting green line 🤪😜 I ordered one but the low spec  But can it replace my quotrealquot computers  No  Because if iPadOS  The hardware is way beyond what the OS is capable of  Maybe they39ll fix that some day But probably not paying almost as much for the new apple pencil as you paid for the eink tablet says it all At this prices I will expect my devices to fly or is it too much to ask Shoutout to the Remarkable Tablet I have one for work Love it When is apple making a touch screen macbook pro Only real Mr whose the boss fans would like this If the new ipad ran standard macOS it would be an amazing laptop replacement  If youre a dev ipadOS 17 is not usable Did they finally make this MacOS or is it still IOS  Nooooooooooooooo  We have Tablet windows devices dropping this year Apple screwed up again M4 Its not a bmw lol I see Your money your choice bro Its understandable from a content creator standpoint Tablets needed a massive revamp in terms of software and hardware which wasnt really happening all these years I see the usecase in M4 and developers need to use the potential of M4 to unlock its true power in new apps Thankfully lightining is removed I want to know more about that ink notebook 😄 name brand price Looks goood Aaaaaahrich people issues Do I spend 3600 on a plate of glass or not What game was that at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt7771257a and is that zbrush on full display  Massive flex This feels like the most pro Apple video you’ve ever made Fr this feels sponsored Yes especially because every feature mentioned I already know about because my Samsung tablet Galaxy Tab S9  can already do And it39s just as thin VeederRootI don’t think apple has ever sponsored anyone ever I think he just doesn’t know that as powerful as the iPad is there are no applications that take advantage of its speed He’ll probably figure that out soon averydee5328yeahand the Biden administration has never pressured socal media companies 😂    He knows what he has to do averydee5328 apple sends free tech to everybody all the timeso they use it in their vids for exposure this also leads to people saying good things abt the products becasue they didnt have to pay for them \\u200baverydee5328of course they have sponsored people yep that39s why I started to have a problem with his reviews a few videos back started to feel like a sellout I think he has always been very fond of Apple products But these are tooo expensive You need to be very rich to be able to comfortably afford these devices and if your not and you still buy these products you are probably being fiscally irresponsible “Apple employee holding the camera and pointing a gun to his head” Maybe he is just giving his honest opinion averydee5328 true but take in consideration that he is a tech reviewer and his sole purpose is to well review tech without bias whyisitsodifficultomakeahandle That is correct but this is a quotwhy I spent 3200 on an ipadquot video not a quotwhy you should spent 3200quot he goes into all of his own reasons not reasons why anyone else should I don39t think him buying the ipad is the right choice enolopanr9820 suddenly we are on the set of Dust \\u200baverydee5328May be expecting Tim Cook to mention him during the next Apple event like did for MKBHD Also even Marques seemed to become less biased after that VeederRootMaybe because it’s the truth and you Android fans simply don’t have the brain capacity to handle it Apple scamming everybody all these stuff they bringing out is all the same I did calculations the iPad is 15 percent faster than m3 Why I spent a fraction of a percent of my net worth on an overpriced tablet It will be around 9 lakh in Pakistan When you get your new iPad Pro you should challenge your editors to use the updated iPad Final Cut Pro to see if an iPad can really replace a Mac Previous versions still take 10 times longer to use than Mac39s Final Cut Pro So this new guy to technology never saw iPad before and this seems to be first time using it with the keyboard or hold it for the first time Someone tell this new guy that laptop cannot be replaced otherwise apple would stop making Macbooks There39s no excuse to this You can get a M3 pro mac for this price what a joke Someone should help me with ipad please😢 i will appreciate an model 😭🙏 Where was Rick Astley Did I miss him 🤔 TLDR because he39s got more money than sense lol So you would be exchanging you laptop for a tablet that you will add extras to in order to essentially make it into a laptop lol why there they know how country where you came from made a deal of loss by setting up iphone assembly facility The title changed from £3k to 36k This is what 90 of iPad users went through in 2018 😂 I’m sorry HOW MUCH Why I don’t spend 3600 on an iPad Apple ruining hardware by not updating software for older devices Anti consumer greedy and no support and no innovation Gaming laptop gt 3500 iPad 🤣 Apart from the fact that the Apple39s OS has always been shit in literally all of their devices clearly including the rather yearly quotupdatedquot iphone it39s simply no surprise The restrictive nature of apple is obvious in their OS and you simply can39t do crap compared to other devices from different brands I had apple for years and I decided to stop buying their scammy little woke shit products Stop funding this load of scammers that try to create a standard when in reality they are controlling and restricting you to hell with devices that have hardware that is not worth it compared to other option in the market and an OS that is the literal definition of quotshitty restrictivenessquot Free yourself from this crap Being positive to pay 3600 for an iPad that is nowhere near MacBook on performance nor in applications My M1 just working fine I39ve got an iPad Air M1 and I love writing my notes on it However its hard to find the appeal in upgrading when the spec bumps won39t get utilized for my workflow Also the most annoying thing about the iPad rn for me is just how unresponsive the quotmousequot interface feels It has a very noticeable delay that just makes things feel slow and not worth doing on the iPad rather than macbook or pc for long tasks Navigating through text using the keyboard is also somehow slow I39m holding off on upgrading until the software gets alot better hoping for great software updates to the ipad in WWDC I just take the moment and embrace the fact MrWho is getting married congratulations in advance brotherbrHitting the pinnacle of life Oh get a WiFi and cellular connection iPad Pro M4 Wellsimple buy a non pro iPad and let the pro buy those because they are actually for the pro Yes I can buy pc…mac or windows…but can I take it to the park and work on the plane anywhere backyard…it’s just common sense Trashing this product when you have better suited product for your needs reminds me of a better performing Surface Pro mrwhosetheboss you should make a video about Galaxy tabs9 vs the new Ipad and show each ones capabilities otherwise it sounds like youre biased towards Apple considering Samsung has been doing everything you said so far in this video for years speacially considering the Dex Mode the old one not the new one They fixed the iPad MacBook cannibalization problem simply by raising the prices on the iPad 😂 Apple users are such mugs 😂 a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6001000a  I

the wedding from😅 Now why do we need a mac😂 I see no problem on replacing my laptop with a tablet I actually plan to do so when I need to use some desktop stuff I can ssh to my workstation and problem solved I live in the US and I am more excited about the new government lawsuit than I am about the new iPad lol Oh and I have that Keyboard lol bro didnt buy the ipad didnt spend 3600 got 12 million veiws practically for free as the videa didnt need as much editing or anything kind of disappointing i used to like ur videos now they are bad I know it39s a first impression video but it kinda feels like a review😅 I spent 10 years as a world travel photographer with just a iPhone amp Ipad and a bag of Nikons I now have a collection of iPads about 20 deep It will change your life if you let it… but you’re gonna need an iPhone too Sorry but welcome well you bought it because reviewing it is your job lol Now just put Macos on itbrbrThat would get me to buy Really Need an ipad scared to ask my parents though Buy the 2 TB version just because you can 😊 The new ipad pros also missing one camera Surprising that nobody talks this In UK 🇬🇧 and European 🇪🇺 iPad costs 1000 more in top spec and we don39t get the wall charger in the box 😑 😢 this should be illegal 😂 I absolutely disagree when it comes to apps vs websites Usually things are buried in apps Menus in menus in menus On desktop it39s vastly easier to navigate Dude needs to Google surface pro haha  They did this years ago I prefer website every time I39m uninstalling as many apps as possible as there39s typically no control over

next iphone goes up in price im going android Guys remember the Iphone 6 bendgate 😂 Such a better review then Marques better thought out and explained I felt and told me more about what I thought this iPad could possibly do It’s not just a spec bump but an entire redesign in a way Thank you In fairness neither of these are reviews One’s a hands on first impression and the other is an optimistic

it because you have no sense of judgement and maybe have too much money as well Basically tablest are the Meduim option in a fastfood place The crazy thing is that in Brazil that is more than most people39s annual salary Nice If someone gave me one of these I would love to use it I would never buy one in 2024 when laptop ultra books fill that niche Why video quality is bad  The reason the iPad uses the M series is because the M series is an ARM but ipadOS is really not ideal for a work station I wish Apple could just allow us to use MacOS on it 2877欧元＝3600美元？？？？are you kidding me？ So does this mean that samsung39s New tablet will have intel core ultra chip or the new snapdragon x elite If that will be true then competition in this market is gonna rise rapidly This is a wannabe mac book air with a touchscreen 😂😂 to create content Small car Not in America That won39t even buy you a decent motorcycle Just buy an iPad with an older M chip and save your money It will not replace your laptop Just got a Tab S9 Ultra last week and was considering returning it in favour of the new iPad Pro But the larger screen on the Samsung is genuinely very useful and the iPad Pro with the keyboard would cost about 80 more than the Tab S9 Ultra with the trackpad keyboard here in the UK  about £800 more 1000 I definitely don39t need the extra performance of the iPad plus the Samsung has expandable storage via MicroSD and it39s also waterproof If the next iPad is 146quot then it might change things but until then Samsung it is Kudos to your s24 Ultra ❤ I am not a quottabletquot user in the conventional sense I use a Surface Pro which is a quottabletquot but does things that a tablet can not Mostly access to work sites and programs that tablets do not support Atleast for now The other reason why I use a Surface Pro and not a phone or laptop is for the pen and supported programs I take ALOT of hand written notes or use the pen for note taking in briefings or while on the go Phones are too small for this purpose and most laptops are too heavy to use in a tablet format So Surface Pro it is bgreat postb been on the fence about getting an older but not ancient Surface Pro I just want to know if readswrites to external media at acceptable speeds I have a Samsung Tab S6 which works well but file xfer via any USB still never seems to throughput at speeds whether flash thumb drives or external SSD39s or M2 in USBenclosure drives I would have thought transfers would have been faster than it turns out they are Looking into Surface Pro this is one of the things I39m concerned about to be able to swap files between devices from external media sources I always use up internal drive available space rather quickly and inevitably have to resort to several TB39s amp TB39s of external media jimthrowaway One of my work tasks is the reimaging of computers As I am sure you know reimaging typically requires gigs of data My typical image is about 35GBs I use a Surface Pro 7 on external NVME drives When a new image is released transferring the image from the SP to a thumb drive can take about 20 minutes if memory serves correct The same transfer to an external NVME drive can take about 10brbrThe upside of getting a Surface Pro 8 or 9 is the internal storage can be upgraded easily as the internal drive is replaceable They use the M2 2230 drive size These used to be hard to come by but can currently be found on Newegg easily and 1TB drives are running at or below 100 USD SgtSeth I have 2 m2 drives in USB enclosures right now a1TB amp 2TB One is a Samsung 980 Pro the other is a generic brand I don39t work in or specialize in data recovery or reimaging  I am familiar with backup imaging and I advocate it over AV software I abandoned AV software over the years eventually in favor of keeping clean virusfree backups of updated OS39es with my software apps freshly installed but not used brbrI have external drives multiple containing virusfree installerkits of all my software apps plus installation product keys activation keys purchase verification details etc I have standalone offline quotnear identical twinquot computers I keep to install new apps onto then immediately create backups kept at different storage media for risk management This is an example of what I described earlier about having multiple TB39s of data Unlike yours my backup imaging files are bfar moreb bare bones and I39ve never had one over 100GB most in range between 3550GB   brbrThe speeds you mentioned about the Surface Pro are much more to my liking than the Tab 6 Tab 6 mind you btw imo is not a bad device I like it well for certain things But my needs are diverse and I39m always looking for good fit options that compliment what I have while adding to it brbrThanks for all ur info  😎😎 This is ridiculously stupid All of it It would be interesting if this Ipad laptop replacement can work but if it was my friend asking Id say quotdont do itquot this guy gtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgt marqass brownlie I love the effort that you and your team put into your videos But I have a small remark I think that you review this device so positively because it helps you work more efficiently Personally when I look at the price I could never see myself buy it unless if it would improve my work output So I would suggest you say something along those lines in your video Because as a consumer this is not a product that you should buy unless it is for work I39m a little confused brbrno tablets cause he doesn39t see the point because he has a phonebrbrcontinues to talk on about the usefulness of the tablet and how sometimes he just needs it brbrbrbrbrbrbruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh I39m a little confused brbrno tablets cause he doesn39t see the point because he has a

Youtube and netflix never looked better does it bend like the iPhone 6 This guy feels like a paid Apple sponsor Literally says nothing bad about anything 😂 You also have Netflix app on Windows laptops which allow you to download P YOUR A 8 TERABYTE TYPE OF GUY I have 500 GB and i39ve only used 64 This is why I veer away from the iPads The iPad Pros are CRAZY expensive now The only ones who would benefit from all of that would be the influencers creators celebrities and rich people However phones spoiled me too much that I can39t look at the iPad Air  probably the best among the iPads for everyone  without my eyes telling me that it39s just a 60Hz LCD screenbrbrThat39s why I got the Galaxy Tab S9 Yes Android is HORRIBLE on tablets and they just become good enough thanks to Samsung39s DeX  and own ecosystem  as a laptop replacement It does what I want it to do it39s not crazy expensive but still VERY expensive and has a beautiful screen Had the iPad Air launched with a 120Hz MiniLED screen I would buy it instead since it39ll pair well with my MacBook AirbrbrIn essence I wouldn39t buy a 2000 tablet knowing I have a 1000 MacBook that does things I do everyday better thanks to the MacOS39 superiority over any desktop OS and the iPadOS and a 1000 tablet that39s half the size of the iPad Pro that doesn39t touch its performance but it doesn39t need to because I don39t do influencer and creative stuff anyway Ive never been into laptops because of the keyboard space so i love ipads They finally added the function keys to Magic Keyboard I love how it got progressively darker as the video went on It39s almost as if the sun was going down GeeEee75 Thanks captain obvious lol \\u200belliottrogozinski You too Arun you can39t play WoW or FFXIV on an iPad yet  Keep your laptop “Filthy Casuals” that39s a wild thing to say 😂😂😂 New Term unlocked 🔓 For NOW Lets wait and see what Nvidia will cook in their ARM cpu segment Finally someone who doesn39t crap all over every new Apple announcement just to get clicks  Good job  A major issue with replacing a Macbook Pro with an iPad Pro is the much shorter battery life as well as the limited high end storage options and iPad OS  Mac OS app issues that you mentioned  Apple should allow the iPad to immediately switch to Mac OS as soon as a keyboard is connected or even better pop up a prompt to either do that or not  But I don39t know if that will ever happen as long as Apple feels they can get more revenue by selling both products  But maybe if they do it they might actually sell bMOREb hardware b100 rightb about autoswitching OS upon autodetect of attached external keypadkeyboard device That it doesn39t is just another example of powertripping corporate bgreedb to suck every single penny out of consumers they think they possibly can they39ll empty our lintridden pants pockets and look under every couch cushion for every penny they can take  their sense of entitlement is absolutely sickening iIMHOi  😎😎😎😎😎😎 And the Calculator 😂 It most likely WON’T be as quick as you might be used to while working on your laptop BUT it is MUCH more convenient…Also if you ever use more than one monitor at a time when using your laptop you won’t be able to do that with an ipad It can handle one extra monitor but not 2 HOWEVER one kind of neat thing is that when you have your ipad close to your laptop it can be set up to automatically become accessible to your laptop meaning you’ll only need one interface at that point to access both devices brbrHonestly If you’re not too familiar with tablets I think it’s going to be a bit of a learning curve but not a big one I suspect that because of the convenience you’ll likely appreciate more than what you’re presently using That’s my two centsP’s worth at any rate 😊 Apple’s taking Nvidia’s place again… Wait just noticed they already had nvidias place with the iPhones Imagine 2TB being not enough storage Samsung is much better than CrApple  of course you won39t use samsung tablets after all you are a apple fanboy and one of those paid iSheep content creator😂 Welcome back to bendgate everybody how is the Ipad air  is it actually worth buying  Watching this on my ipad pro Its the best gadget i own I’d much rather have a thick iPad with double the battery First things first its Apple its expensive im not a Fan of the company and its shenanigans but i have to admit this product looks very nice and in general seems like it could be a real asset to professional designers and such it actually seems well thought out and good overall that said its not a device for me as i prefer more open and fair platforms Bro you are getting in the territory of a spoilt reviewer I understand it39s your job to review new products but now it seems you are trying to hard to explain your upgrades and also influence our livesbrThanks I’m honestly disappointed in these new iPads I’m still keeping my M2 iPad Pro and my 2nd Gen Pencil these new ones really not that different and have features I don’t need Man Apple is genius at making people think they need to keep spending more and more money for the same crap😂 a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a Uh You look like you are really enjoying that smart toothbrush too LOL 🤣 He is brushing his uvula kids dont get phones they get iPad Pro M4 The Samsung Galaxy tab s9 ultra is 55mm thin and has android just try a samsung tablet brtry the tab s9 ultra or wait for the new tab series but its so unsatisfying that u always test only apple products samsung can offer u at least the same performance and experience As a 4th gen iPad Pro owner this thing has never lagged or couldn’t handle anything I’ve needed it for These iPad are all the same product for the average user m1 m2 m3… My 2nd Gens were great until Apple nerfed the software Thinner iPads with larger screens what could possibly go wrong 😂 Bend gate coming 😂 I see his point though and I kinda agree with it I would like for there to be some variety But lol at your comment Throwback if it happens Software sucks yet😢 Try use a Samsung phone in the Apple Store and see if they kick you out 😂 Imagine supporting the massacre on the Congolese by buying an Apple product 😒 meh All that to just play cocomelon videos thanks for ipad ad i pad os is fucking shit If they were going to make a pro device they should have gone all the way Bigger battery more io comes with a keyboard Nobody cares about it being that thin Yeah I mostly agree although I think we could have both I kind of like that it’s so thin it does make sense for note taking and whatnot which is a big reason why I use tablets what were you doing to that toothbrush You lost me at quotI feel way better when a product tells me to use their app than when they direct me to a websitequotbrI absolutely despise services that do not have a functional website and instead use apps like recently I was gonna receive a parcel and the delivery company did bnotb support doing any sort of tracking through anything other than their app which coincidentally happened to require signing up for an account to even begin using  Omg yes really good commentbrI hate when they force you to get on the app I only just noticed this but when you watched these videos on an iPhone the ratio is so good that you don’t lose any video and you still can’t see the notch I love arun One day that battery39s gonna die At this point Apple should trade mark the word quotPROquot 😂😂😂😂 pencil PRO Like Seriously😊 So Basically it39s the touch screen MacBook people been asking for years for But in a way that makes Apple able to get even more money out of you With added ability to leave some features out of iPad os so you still have to buy a MacBook anyway Brilliant Because you are rich Like your background choice brLove the way it slowly got dark as the video progressed I am still using a 129 inch iPad Pro from 2018 It’s still very responsive but I have to charge it more often I probably will go with the new 13 inch Air this time how do you use 8tb But iPad still a iPad  cannot even get some office work done 😂😂 I say only quotJerry rig everythingquot In ten years all companies will be on board with the tablet Most likely won39t be apple though Ayo that toothbrush broll Had to pause at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt256416a thought  so they want people to ditch the laptop and spend a fortune on a tablet then another fortune on the case  keyboard to basically create what looks like a laptop oh and then spend yet more dosh on a pen er no I hate apple No matter how much powerfull a tablet gets you always need a laptop Then 3 months later why I returned the iPad Pro Thing is you don39t really need it Trust me happened to me Wow that was a long rant Talking of being laughable you39d never believe that Google tried to relaunch their Pixel tablet yesterday too 🤣😂 Hi can you tell me or recommend the eink writing tab and where to buy it  Thanks Laptop 39quality39 processor that won39t perform the same Why You also can39t do the same things as a laptop While most people will be wasting money for this tablet since they do little to use the 39improved39 processor It is also not a tablet if you39re using the keyboard cover It is basically modular laptop  Use case all apps and not much else is a waste of the processor power and a waste of money The 39pro39 use case is not there for the iPad Pro It will be a while before everything on laptop is available for iPad As an app and media device no one needs to be paying 3000 or even 1000 As a professional device it39s too expensive for not being there yet really that price Eagerly waiting for Jerry39s review of the new iPad 🌚 All that with no keyboard is a scam So this thin ultra expensive ipad is almost as thin as my ancient Xperia 4 tablet Unless you can play pc games on the iPad it will never replace the Mac bro recovers the double of the price of that tablet in just one YouTube video lol if not more My last iPad Pro suddenly died couple years ago since then i haven39t get a quotnewquot one this one seems the perfect one to get I missed procreate😫 Yo Arun brushing the

requiring permissions and access to my phone more and more crap being installed more and more chance of data leaks etc A lot of apps are just a reskinned webpage anyway I39ve been to restaurants that don39t have Menu39s anymore and you instead have to scan a QR code that takes you to an appto order a meal in a restaurant I hate it nah that toothbrush part was crazy😂😂 because you don39t know what else to do with your money nope Ipad sucks  I want ipad to be good but honestly the holy grail tablet is the hp x11 chromebook  As a developer this chromebook can do tablet stuff but can also run linux apps including vscode  Ipad is just a bigger iphone  Ipad could be so much more not gonna lie the moment I saw the magic keyboard being i immediately thought they have now made a second macbook and the apple pencil now has a model with the wordquotproquotattached to it which sadly was kind of predictable😅 Where is rick Astley Being a tech youtuber is basically making a whole video in order to justify your purchase What about that Macs you can install any dmg  pkg and on an iPad you are limited to the store for now But can you do development I mean coding on the New ipad Who is the better Samsung or IPhone I look at tablets now as a better ereader I mainly use my tablets as ereaders with more options and uses than regular ereaders My 2014 27quot imac still works great I have the iPad Pro129 maxed out from eBay  what a buy and you haven39t said anything that would make me want to upgrade This is a 16 minute video of you justifying spending 3600 on a tablet Which is insane Oh i love my reMarkable In some ways you lose some pc functionality or apps But for another you gain thousands of apps that you haven39t had on your PC You have now a much portable device which can game better multimedia better weights less and do more That39s why I traded an iphone 12 for an iPad air 4 Oh and if you39re going on bus or walking in a bit insecure area you39re not carrying an expensive phone with you all the time I39ve got myself a capable but cheap older flagship and keep my iPad at home most of the time where is safe and end up using it more than my phone what was he doing with toothbrush 💀 iOS 175 is only going to extend life to products that don’t have neural cores like the A10X Ipad Pro 105brbrThe lowest neural core iPad is the A12X and Z iPad Pro models with 8 neural cores Who knows what iOS 18 has available for all iPads with neural cores What Camera did you use to record this video Your face looks dark i honestly feel arun needs a reason to buy the ipad that39s why he39s making thid video and highlighting its quotperksquot   just like MKBHD he won39t be able to go more than a month with that glorified tablet at the end of the day its just a glorified tablet try Samsung tab bro this guy completely lost any common human sense trying to justify a tablet for 4k get out of here mrwhosetheboss you for sure use the toothbrush in a different way Its overpriced af It39s criminal what apple charges for storage on devices with a high starting point The iPad is basically becoming the Microsoft surface with apples on it instead Why can39t  it be 360 Lmao You can spend 3600 on a bag of chips and we wouldn’t be surprised You’ll make 10x that amount from your YouTube video We all know you spend money to make way more money so just making the title “I bought the new iPad” is sufficient People will watch and you’ll earn your money back and some pls honor 90 I can see the 6 month review already quotWhy I switched back to a MacBook Proquot I still not buy it Im sure you39ve bought a macbook pro m1 that you don39t get use out of Arun what would i have to do to convince you to send it to me for my creative work I39ll do ANYTHING If you beat Apple189M at subscriber count You39d also beat MKBHD188M and become the no1 Tech youtuber CoincidencebrPS everyone please don39t remind me of TechGuruji or Unbox Therapy Funny how this review is the exact opposite of MKBHD’s opinion If you carry airpods with you you can just basically get rid of your phone toobrbrYou can just bring the airport out of the pocket instead of your phone to take callsbrbrAnd that will help you reduce screen time and you39ll only do important and necessary work Insightful The “golden age” of desktop PCs have come amp gone The “golden age” of the laptop may be coming to an end and the age of the tablet may be starting If they make a “bridge” app that gives the look and feel of a laptop then that’s the point I will be ready to go all in on a tablet can39t switch from my MacBook Pro unless they build Final Cut Pro and Topaz Video ai for iPad Even then I wonder if it39ll be powerful enough for Topaz my current MacBook Pro m3 max still seems to struggle rendering the video in topaz As a macbook pro user i think id have a better experience and cheaper with a base macbook air 🤷 Can you please buy me an ipad 9 gen and an apple pencil i spent 2500 on a custom PC 100x better than a 3600 ipad willbrlast me 10 years compared to an ipad unless they announce a total revamp of the iPad OS you39ll still have an overpowered tablet held back by the OS and apps Okay cool vid but the fact that the view from your window moves from morning to night as the video progresses is pretty cool too Word processing using Word and Google Docs is HORRENDOUS on iPad With our bad economy now a day Do people really need this Let39s see 3600 iPad Pro 129 pen 349 keyboard 4078 not including tax and recycling fees WOW Haha I am always watching you on the ipadpro not on my Ultra 😂😂 You cannot code on iPads so I will think of switching once that happens  Bro when you spent 3600 plus more money on a pencil plus break the bank again for the keyboard youre not replacing your laptop You39ve spent laptop money to make an IPAD LOOK like a laptop If he makes a video he can write this off as tax deductible so he gets a discount via his accountant Common creater loop hole Vacuous But you know that Many apps are not well designed to run on an ipad Games and designediting apps yes but many many others are not Honestly most people will put a case on it so the thin factor just makes the thing way more prone to bending for no reason Yes it is lighter but what is the point Yeah but if something is wrong with your iPad you would have to replace it whole They don39t fix individual parts  Interesting for a company that waves about mother nature every single time they get and even film a promotional video with quotmother naturequot in it right  As if mother nature would be impressed by them lol M4 for YouTube and what else it’s too expensive might as well buy a pc or stick with my 2022 iPad Pro Hey boss can i have it Struggling creative with a very old crappy computer having 8tb is ridiculous just have a NAS drive Nahh not for me unless they remove ipad OS just put Mac OSsimple I think that the bendgate is coming back 😂 It39s kinda meh  just buy a mac and a iphone  if you really want a tablet for media consumption get the tab s9 ultra  How are you going to grip it  it will just slide out of your hand 😮 Why buy the iPad when there is a Samsung tab 9 ultra No no i want arun to physically move his current home to a new location instead of moving to a new home 😌😌😌 You can do it buddy 💪💪 It39ll be the iphone 6 bendgate all over again I feel like people are forgetting these new iPads are just the first part of the story They went into as much detail as they could before June but come wwdc watch a lot more make sense Take the new Apple Pencil pro it’s a okay update people scoff at the new barrel roll gesture But read between the lines a gyroscope allows the pencil to recognize its place in space and addition that will work really well with Vision Pro They needed the hardware in place before they tell us the second part of the story What’s the big deal about it being thinner Or thinnest so far Most people’s gonna have a case over it 3 words Galaxy

upgraded model and use it for personal and business needs after the fact Then you can find out if it39ll actually be as useful for your workflow as you hoped it would be or if you still benefit from discrete devices for their specialized roles Personally I39ve always been terribly fond of the idea of tablets but as soon as I actually own one the interest fades because they39re just an inconvenient form factor compared to phones or laptops They39re more cumbersome to hold than a phone and they don39t work as well on your lap Maybe the new iPad Pro with the upgraded magic keyboard

farted I stopped being a big tablet person ever since I got my new phone which is a lot bigger than my old one but sometimes I just need a big screen As a developer an iPad is kinda useless for me in that regard No code execution no console no good IDE  wheres the ipad pro m3 Samsung note app and stylus is the reason why i still use tab Samsung tab is my best friend 😄 It feels like it is more than you could ever use in an ipad Jerry Rig is gonna have a field day with this one 😂 When something feels like its at a tipping point it usually means its a generation or two away from the actual tipping point Deffo My thoughts exactly It39s exciting but I doubt we39re there quiteeee yet Yep Unless there are some iPad OS fundamental changes his childlike enthusiasm is going to peter off in a few months of purchase and he’ll be making a video entitled “why I went back to my MacBook and dumped my iPad”brbrI predict it will be a middle ground and he’ll end up using his iPad mostly as a second

own an ipad Then again I don39t use my laptop for stuff most people do Also can we talk about the lack of apks on ipadOS It sucks I watched the revealgotta say there was a lot of CGI that was noticeable when people were quotinteractingquot with the tablet Wait until you actually you use it And connect a mouse And start to scroll… ↕ And connect a screen Connect a screen and close your iPad in your Keyboad Or you want to plug in a HDMI cable Or want to skip an ad but somehow you Magic Keyboard trackpad doesn’t do the click anymore so the next 30 sec ad starts playing  Nah I have my iPad Pro 129 the one before M1 for a few years and tried a few times to actually use it but it’s just to much of a hassle I love watching this guy lose his mind over technology getting slightly better when you dont really need this much stuff As someone with an iPad from 2019 there39s no way that this is even close to worth it I have a mac mini and a macbook that I do work on iPads are glorified streaming screens And trust me I love my little streaming screen but it can39t replace your macbook for most normal work Bro is starting a new era  the peak of iPad kids maybe adults too now Eeeh someone lost touch with the common man here I keep forgetting just how much apple bias this guy has This TABLET costs as much as the damn Vision Pro and and can39t even perform as good as a laptop at half the cost and can39t even do nearly the same amount of things as said laptop The price on this makes this absolutely hilarious and seeing people like you justify it makes me realize just how much you guys don39t know how the average consumer lives Being there done that Came back to my MBP after one year Everything he said it is true on theory but they don39t work as you expect them to Limitations start to creep up on multitasking and the terrible file management when moving files between apps Me too had a workflow that could fit in the iPad Pro but after the honey moon phase ended

laptop  which I don’t currently own Yes it’s thin and probably bendy or too breakable and the camera is finally in the right place the screen is sexy but…nearly 4 grand I love my Apple products but for people like me who squeak by each month on a pathetically parsimonious fixed income Apple is pricing their products so ridiculously high that they’re squeezing normal ‘unrich’ customers right out of the market Add to it their gouging tactic of forcing customers to buy cables bricks and pencils just to use their overpriced products merely adds to the dissatisfaction that’s beginning to burn in a significant way Over hype to the maxif ai pins are trash hows is this justifiable at this price point Literally allows apple to sell laptop priced tablet sales now absolutely no real innovative tech but a ridiculously over powdered tablet People are jokes no wonder Warren sold off apple stocks the writing is on the wall The hopium is strong with this one Jerry rig eats the new ipad for breakfast Omg its an iphone productwhat do u expecthelllloooo I39m an iPad pro M1 user and Im disappointed that Apple has crippled it Just giving it a proper full fledged MacOS only can solve itbrOtherwise its

will always be an iPad It’s  kept in its own niche for a reason and apple will never enable it to be capable enough to replace a MacBook Because you’re rich That’s why 😂😂😂 I’ve had both iPads and

cant see them But that glares block you to enjoy the quotreal blackquot of an OLED screen Unless it can run macos apps it may as well not exist the iPad Air is meant to be the thinnest before the new iPad Pro came out so how thin will the Air be Most powerful notetaking machine Arun you39re cool but you39re totally bias and a fanboy MKBHD took about 8 minutes to explain almost everything and

feels like a little too much And considering you would have to buy more Apple hardware and software to fully utilize the product I dont feel like this should be recommended to the average consumer

actual differences between iOS and android where a Samsung needs 16gb of ram an Apple product can match it with 4gb of ram due to its system being precisely optimized for it Android on the other hand is open source and is not optimized for any phone in particular Also with the hardware part Did you watch the complete video Samsung still uses PHONE chips which are much worse than a m4 chip Therefore your comment doesn’t make much sense I don’t mean this in an offensive way I’m just correcting you and uses less material so it39s cheaper for Apple to produce \\u200bslayyer2nd170 It39s

pro do for it that putting their latest iphone processor in it nothing because it still runs a mobile software and not macOS all that extra power is going to complete waste because fanboys like you think for some reason better processor means everything is better when there is diminishing returns on such limiting software it genuinely means nothing that apple is using a computer cpu in the ipad when it cant take advantage of anything close to the full power of the M4 I love poor people complaining about things being expensive I think this is another quotsoft launchquot of an idea Apple has where it39s really just for the tech junkies and apple fans to fiddle with user test the idea then come out with a proper consumer friendly version down the line see apple watch na3rial What are you

drops by 15 slayyer2nd170 RE quot  Samsung still uses PHONE chips which are much worse than a m4 chip quot iWHAT i what are you saying  Samsung phones use ARMprocessors which is what the whole Apple Mseries of chips iwas originally inspired fromi Go ahead look up the evolution of where M4 amp Mseries chips in general originated from ARMprocessors which yes are used in Samsung phones An Apple M4 is the latest version of its predecessor the M1 which is when apple decided to switch its MacBook Pro39s regular cpu processors for what now is called Mseries which is effectively Apple39s proprietary own inhouse version of ARMprocessor technology I think ur comparison between 16gb Samsung to 4gb Apple would be more applicable if it were referring to Windows using INTEL or AMD pentium cpu based 1122nm architectures  vs Apple39s Mseries processors which have continuously gotten smaller amp smaller 5nm 3nm that39s where ur ratio39s were correct in 41 more efficient but it39s not between Samsung phones and Mseries it39s between nmarchitecture sizes between conventional X86X64 chips that use larger amp more complicated instruction sets which runs slower versus ARMchips which break down instruction sets into smaller simpler pieces ARM processes each much faster while generating far less heat and requires less nmarchitecture space to do it Only exceptionally highend complex equation math in specially made computers in fields like aerospace engineering or hightech medical molecularlevel scientific study justifies the use of complicatedinstructionset processing larger nmarchitecture it was determined Even what seems like demanding apps like gaming or videoediting can be done much faster with simpleinstructionset instead of complicatedinstructionset processing It39s smaller faster less heat it39s a cpuprocessing technology not a Samsung phone vs any Apple product That distinction needs absolutely to be clarified no offense \\u200b\\u200bdaviisrandomlool glad

the same things lool makes sense but who am I to judge do your thing Fractoide What are you talking about The M4 is more powerful than Intel It39s more powerful than any computer chip Apple currently sells I39m not sure what is weird about it It39s an extremely powerful chip mikemccormick6128 well that39s the point It39s an extremely powerful chip in a limited operating system The iPad doesn39t allow you to take advantage of it pretty much everything could already be done with the M2 which was already overpowered Almost nobody actually needs the M4 iPad pro If you actually needed that much power for profesional use you39d get an actual laptop instead ASEM1123 point wasn’t to make apple look better I’m just saying that it’s heavily based on os so the person wouldn’t need to one above the

supports extensions Without these three things it will NEVER be a laptop replacement  for me at least I asked my girl to marry me and she said yes Why he brush his teeth like that I thought my Tab S9 Ultra is thin enough Basic Pen amp Paper never looked so attractive Arun is getting worse everyday it39s like he didn39t even know what he39s talking about😂 For example the keyboards feature already exists few years ago💀 Amazing video… I love it every second watching it… and I agree absolutely with everything you said I guess WWDC it’s the key for the future of iPads I have an M1 with 2tb that’s it’s actually more capable than my MacBook Pro … I’m excited for the near future i am sri lankan i m poor pls give me lap or pc i cant get pc i am poobrr Basically the ipad is behind all the windows tablets that are both tablets and laptops… minisforum Amd tablet  surface  asus rog z13 some run up to 165hz and have 4k res…why are people acting amazed for this tech …m4 is still as useless as the m2 on a ipad… great build quality reliable echo system  powerful borderline useless for most things… don’t ignore the ipad is still playing “catch up” … What is the game that he keeps showing on this you can draw in 10000 FPS but game in 10 FPS You know you can double tap your regular Apple Pen to change tools or other actions right I really do not know😂 How stupid Just trying to show he has money Found myself in the same boat yesterday definitely wasn39t planning on buying one but oh well damn you Tim Cook  Zero point in making this video because you are 100 aware that you are going to buy a Mac when it comes out at WWDC and then your also going to buy the newest iPhonetabletand every MacBook or Mac pro in the future So it’s pointless for this whole video Explain to me how you plan to replace a Macbook or any PC with a tablet that has software that you should just light on fire from how nonsensical it is  Define ipados as a quotsimplequot system I define it as neuteredbrAll the reasons you explained as to why you are spending a fortune on this iPad are all excuses You wanted the big beautiful tablet and you buy it You39re not going to replace your Mac with it and you39re not going to stop using that nice comfortable 400gram tablet You do well you can afford it and you buy it but tell me you want to do the one that has it bigger I respect you more Instead you pulled a 16minute video out of it trying to legitimize your choice No need do whatever you wantbrI will probably buy this iPad pro too Do I need it No Will I replace my M1 Mac for goodness sake I hate it or the PC ❤ NO Will I like it Yes I will buy it GG Fool an their money easily parted as they say Well made video and very interesting You should know you twice said you are planning a new home and “exact same” is redundant Thank you Yes Apple… release the new iPad a week after I buy the old one… THIS IS 3 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MY PC it is just a little more powerful and bigger phone that costs way more than a top tier Windows laptop Sounds like a big 👎🏻 to me This doesn39t seem like a sincere opinion Who is making the “I’m a very excited man right now” meme It39s so simple for me just having a laptop with tablet screen that you can detach One I39m old I will never watch anything past an Instagram reel on a phone I have 2 iPads the M1 iPad Pro and the iPad Mini that I use mini for my camera stuff My\\xa0M1 Pad as I call it is what a take unless I going to be gone more than a few days And to be honest it still does everything I need it to do I order the M4 because my grandchild needs a update before heading to college Apple is and has been obsessed with thin and well no one is perfect I learned years ago that my life works better if I stay in only one ecosystem so all I have is Apple My DJI controller and my YoloBox are Android but they are closed systems that I don39t really have to deal with FYI you want a much cheaper video monitor thats great  use the Accsoon SeeMo and your iPad verses an overpriced monitor I do love the iPad and a few Apple products but I really want to understand Apple39s fetish for making everything extremely super thin Just dreaming about i forgot 😂 Watching this on a 300 ipad9😮😅 Imagine replacing your desktop and laptop with just a tablet that you can plug into monitors at your desk and replacing your phone with a smartwatch that can be connected to your tablet If you can call with both your tablet and watch what would you need a phone for You just went from 25kg to 600g and 400g to 100g and unified all your files onto one device instead of having to send or AirDrop brbrThink about it what functionality would you lose You paid 3000k because you could afford it I am from Malawi and yes I love ipad but as a medical doctor that39s maybe 8 months of my salary 300 usd pm I like how you can see the sun slowly set throughout the video I have a iPad mini 6 It’s one of the greatest devices I’ve ever had It’s insanely fast never lags like my 15 pro has crazy storage The screen resolution is amazing I’m still blown away when I change from low quality to super high on YouTube videos I couldn’t image the m4 iPad I would literally just not use it for watching things could have bought 3 gaming PCs Glad u r still using the Samsung Galaxy 24 ultra It is pretty sick  Definitely annoying being so locked in with apple cuz essentially u just want to enjoy a cool new phone amp it shouldn39t b so difficult to mesh with other brands This year I spent 1000£ on a Samsung tablet that can do anything brEnded up watching YouTube and twitch on it 95 of my free timebrNothing better to work or gaming on like big fat PC Image Brawl stars on a 3600 dollar tablet Imagine a kid owning this ipad just to watch youtube😅 The most expensive recipe book 80 of my iPad use is to look up recipes in the kitchen when I’m cooking I think iPad is where tech enthusiasts and technologists reach a disagreement I place iPad and Chromebooks in a similar category With a ton of workarounds they can do pretty much anything but then why not just use a PC I think they have everything most people need but if you are a developer sysadmin infosec  professional data analyst etc the iPad wouldn39t replace your PC Samsung S8 Ultra 2022 still better than this even with Dex way much better Still using flawlessly Zach is gonna have a field day with this one Tim Cooks happy days  Job well done  No matter what you cant justify the price while comparing it even with Macbook bruh the whole Mac functionality with iPad works with all the shortcuts and gestures even with a Logitech keyboard folio and a regular iPad Nothing new Same old story  Nothing exciting about the new iPad Pro Samsung tablets are the best a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt320520a same price as iPad 10😳 I still can‘t run docker 😢 clown world we live in I’ve had the same experience but sooner I see a lot of people complaining saying that it39s too powerful to just watch Netflix or YouTube or for kids to play games I39m an artist and this iPad does everything I need and more This is for people who use it for their profession If you want to watch Netflix then just get a cheaper one Stop complaining They need to allow Mac OS on it to be a full replacement for many industries Because I don’t need a PC My iPad is my PC 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️💕 Bro started the video in daylight and finished midnight Why is this guy yapping about everything that I have known of the ipad for like 4 years Also for the storage thing its possible to manage it like on PC lol Worst Pre review ever  The problem with the iPad is the OS is not a real platform for pro designers for example  or for someone that codes all day  is only a  faster machine to watch Netflix and youtube Even though this ipad is SOO overkill for what I need it for I cant wait to save up for itt almost there 🤞🤞 No matter how good the tablet is it will die in 5 years because of the battery Batteries die no matter how good the product is Until battery tech improves devices will die When you have an PC 10x cheaper than the iPad Pro but you still watch the review 😅 This video is a meat riding masterclass What39s the ARPG shown in the video I will be amazed if you find moving from a MacBook to the new iPad Pro anything other than an annoyance for much of the time  I did with the previous iPad Pro  It’s stuff like how iPadOS handles file extensions and file system that drives you insane  Until Apple sorts this if they ever do and doesn’t use hugely cut down apps why it will never replace the MacBook You can tell he’s been sitting there for a while thinking when the morning turns into an evening in the background Do you think that Modern tech companies have neglected the past tech and should make a universal adapter to access past tech to help preserve history Let me guess  they pipe the heat of the M4 to the RAM and storage and think that39s a good thing LOL tablet is the only thing that apple beats samsung in Honestly who cares how thin it is iPads are such a waste of money and I was fooled into buying one too Hardly use it phone or tv everything else is unnecessary Desktop then for all other things He was playing diablo immortal  nooooooooooooooo Bro out here justifying 3000 plate I really like my iPad don’t understand why these iPads are sooo expensive but can’t do what a MacBook can for the same price But to draw and just to watch movies with the iPad is absolutely amazing Apple trying to make vision pro seem reasonably priced mrwhostheboss trust me when I say right now doing real work on an iPad I39ve got a M1 11quot with a keyboard amp Pencil it39s a nightmare  I believe that the next iPados will make things better  but you never buy a product on the future software Still waiting for all the Samsung Knightz to respond Thinner which is more fragile second camera lense removed to have 1 only better display and performance and a limited OS that  you will never use the 100 of the chip performance for that price No thanks I can build a super computer with that amount and have some left Apple trying to make vision pro seem reasonably priced 400K subscribers to get to apple 🎉🎉 After really trying to use the iPad as the second computer I realized that it can be done  I just found myself going back to a regular computer  The MacBook Air is great as a second computer 400K subscribers to get to apple 🎉🎉 quotLook at how rich I amquot I have a 1tb M2 iPad Pro that I will not replace anytime soon as my portable computing device and I have a Mac at home I’m perfectly happy with this setup As some one who uses an iPad for drawing I would love that barrel roll feature on the Apple Pencil Pro… too bad it’s not compatible with my M2 iPad Pro 😢 Apple trying to make vision pro seem reasonable So I could either get a powerful gaming computer and a normal android tablet or I could get an ipad probrI understand it39s powerful but these prices are just getting silly specially here in Europe 3600 is a crazy amount of money … So we don’t have to 😅 The fact that 16 of that cost is taxes is utter rubbish Can you please do a review on xiaomi39s latest budget phone that is the redmi turbo 3 rumored to be the Poco F6 would be really interesting too see how far budget phones improved especially this one for less than 300 having the snapdragon 8s gen3 Thats what I39m waiting for Sooner or later someone is going to bend this very expensive thing very easily and bendgate 30 will start Hey I really like the setup It has a simple minimalist look and feel I get AMD tablets more worthy This whole thing reeks like a sponsored post Arun don39t forget your promise on building the most powerful iPhone once you overtake apple in subscribers Why you spent 3k on a nerfed MacBook air I don39t even use Apple but I liked this POV Terrible price It depends on your lifestyle personally I don39t need one I use a book for writing a phone for everything else and a windows PC for work And with the introduction of AR glasses it really doesn39t fit in my lifestyle IM HAPPY THAT I NEW BOUGHT ANY APPLE DEVICE IT39S NOT THAT I CAN39T AFFORD BUT I JUST PREFER ANDROID MORE 😂 Why you spent 3k Because you have the money Simple 😌 Also BTD6 is really good on ipad I love your enthusiasm it reminds me of the early days of the iPad and iPad Pro where lots of folks in the Apple community were excited by the promise and potential of the iPad but as the years went on and Apple seemed unwilling or unable to help iPadOS become more powerful and fullyfeatured gradually lost that excitement and switched back to using Macs I suspect you39re going to go on that same journey yourself If they make iPads any better it will start competing with their own lower end MacBooks or maybe even iMacs I doubt they wanna risk that The same reason MacBooks don39t open 360° probably The premise of the video is wrongbr1 changing only makes sense if the product you are going to buy the iPad is cheaper than buying a MacBook which is not the casebrbr2 If you complain about the weight of the MacBook Pro but you are willing to go to a tablet that has limited software and that is at most half the performance you could go directly to a MacBook Air that is much lighter and we fall back to the first point it is much cheaperbrbr3600 allows youbr1 buy a macbook air that is useful for productivity if you need more power buy a secondhand Macbook pro M1br2 buy a PS4  TV or a 700 PC to playbr3 Samsung tablet  iPad Air to consume contentbrbrand if you know how to search you can keep 13 of the remaining money have 3 products that will do each of the functions much better than that iPad Pro would do they will be easier to resell in the future and I repeat cheaper \\u200bascended1924which is why people shouldn39t buy iPad pros it has an M4 in it for nothing more than an inferior Macbook experience For the pro teir it should have a a full Mac OS then the cost could be justified it39s for the   you wouldn39t watch a review if it was boring to watch so he has to act Using a device for all your entertainment AND work surely the battery won39t last you both Imagine working for 4 hrs with video calls etc etc and then going and Playing an fpp shooter game and still have battery for Netflix binge I doubt Interesting stuff 3600 for big as bezels is crazy 51mm 😂 why oh why is it that thinseems so easy to break somehow Never buying it until it39s free but that39s just cause I39m lol😅 I wish I could make a video that would pay for my new tech and some every time I wanted new tech 😂 this is business done right The reason we have highly priced phones is because at some point when the  Contect creators bought these devices they would say that they were reasonable at a highly inflated price range so yep Gadgets are ridiculously expensive now But has it got a calculator app Can’t wait to see a parent buy this for their kid to watch coco melon and play roblox on it just to laugh directly in their face most powerful device to play games with freinds So its a macbook but you have to buy it again The only real issue left to be addressed on iPad is the audio stack every iPad kid39s dream The minute all your positivity will change will be when you open an app … and it forces you to portrait … When all you want is brto use the device 100 of the time  attached to the keyboard  Then you will never forgive its stupidity  And this happens with a lot of apps … they should honestly just merge MacOS and iPad OS use the MacOS interface when using a keyboard and the iPadOS when not so basically just MacOS with an iPad mode my 2nd or 3rd Gen iPad Pro was so good there is absolutely no reason to EVER upgrade it Well done Apple saving me a fortune Over 4k on an iPad cuz of course nothing is included Nahhhh Really appreciate the greed leaking to other brands too cuz hey they39re making a killing why shouldn39t we 🤬 a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt7321212a Şeytan ayrıntıda 😂 Yes we all know you have a lot of money to spend 🙄 this is exaactly how i used to explain my parents why i need a better laptop for school project Arun is doing the same just instead of parents its us You sure convinced me hate the ipad os cursor and no most web apps are better implemented and better furnished with features than their app counterparts like google productivity apps and bankingfinance apps also the file manager is just not as intuitive to use as mac os ipad os has come a long way but between an ipad and mba i still carry my mba because i know i can seriously get work done without any fustration even DeX is way usable for my officeheavy use case oh yea until i need to scribble notes so that requires an additional lighter ipad mini or until the mystical foldable macbook arrives with hopefully pencil support Is this sponcer by apple Kind of sounds like you spunked £3k on a tablet and are trying to convince yourself that its a good idea ngl the only thing this is good for is for games like genshin iPad pro is overrated Go back to making a prison review 🙄 Watching this video I couldn39t help but feel torn On one hand there39s this undeniable pull of Apple39s sleek gadgets even though anyone having both the mac and an iPhone would feel the need to buy an iPad well cuz why not But then I can39t shake off this nagging feeling that investing in yet another Apple product might not be the wisest move especially when a good ol39 PC could pack a serious punch at a similar price And tbh the uncertainty over the performance of the new chip is unreal It39s like Apple39s playing this long game nudging us to buy into their whole ecosystem But here39s the thing – even Ytbers seem confused at this point and lets be real they wouldn39t swap their macs performance for an iPad right brps would prefer a PC over it That’s too much to pay for iPad 😂 just buy new laptop Like to see a video in about 2 month or 1 year how you are doing with the iPad The only thing the ipad is good for is artists who draw That39s it It39s an amazing tool for drawing but there aren39t that many other usecases for a 3000 tablet a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt7581238a quotThose blacks are sooo deep it39s like you39re starring into the voidquot LOL Nobody talking about that 2018

disagree if given the choice I will always use the website rather to the app on iPad This is for 2 reasons 1 Security and privacy 2 MultitaskingbrbrSecurity and privacy In their own app devs have more ability to mine your data especially those apps that can runs in the backgrounds YouTube Facebook etc While on the website even on iPadOS you have optionsability to block that with the

and you will have to manually resume it every times you switch back On the browser just open another tabbrbrHonestly I think you just got gaslighted by the fancy Apple’s keynote Because if you are a daily iPad user who no longer have a laptop like me you would have know that the iPadOS experience is infuriating no matter how many 01mm did they shave of the thicknessbrbrIt is the most wasteful £2000 I have ever spent todate yall jus have money to jus spend on these things huh Can it play WarZone Mobile That39s all that matters 😂😂 I have a cellular model iPad Pro and it is definitely worth the upgrade Typically or at least in the US your carrier will have a subsidized plan for tablets specifically For me it’s 10mo to have my iPad connected to cellular and also have a hotspot it also includes 5G and the ultra wide band too I think the solution you are looking for is a 360 device Maybe a new arm based windows 360 device which is also light Appli will not make a 360 device Definitely go cellular this video is an advertisement Wow the pencil finally caught up to samsung huh how quotrevolutionaryquot of them Looks like Arun39s officially sold out to Apple The new iPad Pro has great hardware but its tied to an operating system that targets Apple39s lowest performing devices and incentives developers to make their apps usable on those devices Nearly all quotprofessionalquot apps on iPad use a FRACTION of the hardware39s power and have far superior PCMac versions Calling this a laptop replacement is a downright lie It is still just an iPad with the same OS IPhone 15 User be like a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt42042a So we don’t have to So an iPad with a filesystembasically an iPad with MacOS or a Mac with a touchscreen would be perfect That39s probably never going to happen but it would be awesome Apple argue that MacOS is not designed for touch I tend to agree Have you used a windows computer with touch It39s awkward I think as more applications support iPad OS we will see the best of both worlds very soon I do wish they allowed you to install software on them from third party sources though for me tablets are an absolute must have i use it nonstop iPad Pro M4 or a weekend getaway with  to spare Hmmm Decisions decisions 🤔🤭 Can we all just agree that what Apple needs to do is create a MacBook Pro that uses an iPad as a detachable screen and the keyboard as a docking station with multiple IO ports Problem solved a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt386626a GAME NAME PLS It39s devastating for me to admit but if someone wants to buy a decent tablet then he should look at OnePlus Pad or Huawei MatePad Those are devices that offer a reasonable balance between hardware and price Apple doesn39t know what a tablet should be and as an iPad user I would struggle to recommend their product I’m just annoyed all I wanted was an updated iPad mini Sounds like all of these are Mac problems and not quotDesktopquot problems in general It continues to amaze me how caught up people are on Apple devices that are decades behind PC Microsoft Surface Pro has been doing this since 2013 It39s like device racism The meat riding is crazy on this one🔥 Because 1 video and you got it back lol Now the limiting factor is the OS Mrwhosetheboss can i please have your MacBook to begin my coding journey when you decide to replace it with the iPad 🥺🙏 biIt doesn’t matter how rich I get in life I’m never buying a 3000 tabletib 😭💀 I swear this guy is buffing out his videos with long commentary often veering offtopic to maximize monetization opportunities Didn39t used to be like this I agree Unless you draw digitally I just can’t see why you’d need this over a laptop I’m pretty positive it’ll turn into a Netflix and YouTube machine for everyone else 😂 trust me as of now the MacBook even with m2 is much better then that  you still don39t need a iPad MacBook is king  Xperia X2 still thinner than all of these quotthin tabletsquot It39s still just an iPad Arun At this point i truly believe Apple is knowingly limiting its new user with their Ipad OS as they know if they allow their user to perform all the task like in Mackbook people would most likely not buy the next gen MacBook maybe for few years atleast 😂😂😂brbrbrSo thats why I appreciate Samsung as it is flexible and provide complete options like Dex mode and other related features so that user can take advantage of the new powerful  hardware in its new premium tablet 😊 Google sheets is just too hard on iPad a

aren39t for people who want almost a Mac but more than an iPhone They are for iPad users I use an M2 iPad Pro simply because the field  apps I need to use for work don39t exist on Mac or Windows They are only for iOS and need the Lidar stuff the pencil and touch screen the 5G and the portrait orientation It39s also my favorite platform for everyday things pretty much leaving my Windows PC only for Blender Resolve and Steam Bro don’t you mean £3000 bcuz u are literally from 🇬🇧 And there comes an ad for that same ipad before the video Wow a paid advertisement before another paid advertisement I just ordered the 13” My fourth iPad Pro I wasn’t going to upgrade my 2022 iPad Pro but… OLED Been waiting for years Having recently procured two very large ultrawidescreen Philips OLED monitors OLED TV’s in the house and an iPhone 15 Pro Max the iPad is the last device without OLED Until next week anyway iPhones have had AMOLED for a number of years but I was holding on to my iPhone X until Apple switched to USBC If you like me are happy that Apple finally adopted USBC across all devices then send a thank you to your EU representatives because it is the EU which forced Apples hand Oh that’s right… We already know yall just over hype shit to the point for no return for no fucking reason Don’t swear kids might watch this Arun u may regret the decision down the line after an year or an update brbrWe all know apple used to force us to do software updates in the tablet and phones compared to Mac Which directly impact the performance of the product brbrIt39s just my thought But I am eager to know your experience with it and ur opinion on laptop and tablet I am an A Level student and it feels like notetaking and my organisation on the iPad is very nice I can39t wait for Apple to allow sideloading etc other features when they open up iPadOS Sidelining will barely occur with iPadOS due to Apple39s continuing anticonsumer practices Because you can afford to while us mere peasants cannot To talk you out of getting an ipad If you already have a laptop What39s the purpose to upgrade Just use your laptop until it gets outdated Then buy a iPad at that timebrbrUnless you can find a real reason to upgrade other then quotoh this is slightly faster then my old onequot Just stick with your old devices Do Apple Sponsor you sounds like I have the anwer to make a youtube video that will make more money than that because people watch apple content way more then any other brands combined Thank you I39d love to see tests of android tablets too Just saying ¯ツ¯ You will regret not using a laptop Ditched my MacBook for a 5th gen iPad Pro a few years back and have not regretted it one bit We already know yall promotional gag talk quot it runs the pro apps  it can replace my walletm it can replace my iMac it can replace my macbookquot when it all essentially does the same m blah blah blah quotGaming is better on iPadquot 😂😂😂brbrShow me Cyberpunk using Ultra

I guess he found a reason in the analytics to limit it now 🙂 Can anyone shed any info on the writing tablet at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt125205a Thanks Stop spreading miss information that the iPad can replace a laptop It can now it can replace a Mac but it can39t replace a Windows laptop Gucci parfum Buy it try and and then bring it back I can buy 2 Royal Enfield bikes with that money Great review Didn39t see any big changes To me the reasons not to buy an iPad stayed the same I’ve had a lot of these thoughts also arun It’s a tantalizing idea but in practice MacBooks and pcs in general are just way more flexible It’s a good companion to my laptop but it’s not a replacement guys if u want it buy the mac air version of the same chip As someone who owns an iPad Pro and uses it for school with the Apple Pencil I feel as if the iPad is a good “middle ground” for a lot of people Being able to use my iPad for taking notes while also using it for other purposes instead of having to use 2 separate devices is really helpful However there are some instances where I have to still use a laptop and I feel like Apple is trying to eliminate the need for 2 devices with these significant performance upgrades In my opinion the only real reason to still buy an iPad even after the new release is if you are going to use the Apple Pencil on a regular basis Expensive and piece of shit and yall still buy them like they better than the regular ipad Trust me you don’t want to use the iPad app for google docs and sheets They are very limited Because it39s your job Imagine a kid dropping this and getting a bunch of cheetoh dust on it 😅 I love mrwhoestehboss Guys dont forget to subscribe to Arun since we need the video of him making the world39s biggest

you hold it a little too firm Asking for a friend of course I would like to buy a 3000 car Ever since the MacBooks switched to Apple Silicon and Final Cut Pro app dropped for iPad I39d get the iPad

tablet user I39m 9 mins 56 seconds in and dang ARUN quotfilthy casualsquot LOL Somebody tell this guy about the onyx boox note air3c to replace his remarkable He can do alot in that The tech space will always have different stages of development so that means we will have different uses for different products Apple has been smart about this I have a iPhone iPad iMac and a Chromebook Apple user since 1982 Apple owner since 1986  If you have several devices you39ll find different uses for them I use the phone primarily for phone calls and texting more texting than calls The iPad is my go to device at home Media consumption email texting mostly The chromebook is for writing on the road or away from my office setup at home Each device has come to fill a comfortable niche in my life I think Apple realizes that we39re not at the point in hardwaresoftware development where one device works well for all use cases It39s a balancing act not always handled well see the disastrous Apple product line in the 1990s The world has become pretty well integrated into and dependent upon internetdigital connections over the last 25 years I feel for most people who only have a phone to connect with the world Depending on what they need to do they operate at a distinct disadvantage I think Apple could do more to provide a robust secondaryrefurbish market at a lower price point for slightly older products i really like the aspect ratio of this video ❤❤❤ Well don39t watch it in on the iPad because it39s the wrong ratio for video And more that not you Aron and as well not Marques arent talking about neither M3 Chip issue Because you are rich probably would say bad with money as well though probably you paid for it just by posting this video Bro you’re a millionaire Just buy it already 😂😂 wtf are you talking about you don’t want to add another cellular bill  😂😂😂 I find the hiding interesting from Apple that they had issues with the M3 Chips which cant be solved by software because it is Hardware based and how proud they are to jump from M2M4 but with the wrong reasonbrbr“Researchers have discovered a new unpatchable security flaw that can break encryption on the best MacBooks if exploited by an attackerbrIts about the M3 Chips If you think the iPad is a laptop replacement you39re out of your mind Rich Gen alpha iPad kids after watching this video be likebrbr“All my fellas” 🎵 Great advert It would be great if Apple Sponsored this video 😊 ipad pro is slowly becoming a touch screen macbook Spending 2k to use it for gaming wait until we see the quotbend testquot 😂 Nobody wanted it to be thinner Bendgate 2024 Can39t wait for Zack to get his hands on it Nice promotion ₹5 credited to bank Great 😅 apple glazer Well if ultimate convenience and portability is the goal I guess that fits the bill  As a Windows PC guy myself I wouldn39t be able to replace my laptop experience as seamlessly as a MacBook user could with an iPad but it39d be nice if I could  3600 is pretty ridiculous though Every review says that the M4 its not a needed upgrade and that a M1 could have done the same in 90 of cases So why Android Tablets with phone chips that have gotten as powerful as a M1 Pro should be a problem I swore they said Final Cut and Logic Pro 2 meaning only Logic Pro was the 2 👀 Switching between apps is a nightmare tried using an ipad as a computer for 2 weeks horrendous experience Went back to my MacBook so fast Can’t download torrents I just want an OLED panel maybe the pen LIDAR for 3D art and kickstarting 3D printing and that39s itbrand that39s 1000 right therebrbrWhy doesn39t the Air at least have the 120Hz refresh rate 😭 So if you wanna use the iPad as a Mac you have to buy a magic keyboard and a pen just to have it as a more expensive less powerful version of the Mac Yeah cool nice shirt you are wearing can you tell me what shirt is that How little he knows that apps are different for iPhone and iPad lmao You think 10 years ago was the first PC years wth Bend gate but more easier I bought mine the minute the event ended I use my M2 iPad Pro all day every day for school I39m a college student about to end year two of eight I will be using an iPad for a long time I couldn39t care less about new iPhones or MacBooks but I39ve been stoked on this new iPad since I found out about it All of my textbooks are on my iPad in PDF form I do all of my assignments on my iPad take all my notes instead of packing around a 50 lbs backpack I carry an iPad amp Apple Pencil It39s revolutionary as a student brBut I would have rather have had more battery than quotthe thinnest Apple product everquot  That39s my big complaint Waiting for jerryrigeverything 😅 bro shifted from a tech youtuber  to a lifestyle youtuber 😅 Bixby multitasking 😅 its an iPad you realize that I cant code on it  So why use it  Why do we even let Apple be a company If it was a company in the EU they39d have shut it down already Crazy Now my Tab S9U feels thick as a brick with

That39s a apple pc price pine apple pen Original Title iPad Pro M4 Hands on  Why I just bought it Dont see a differencebrMy iPad whenever it goes 120fps it overheats after an hourbrI got the last version and I don’t think the new one can fix that issue Eventually oled in the air 🤞 LOL Overpriced and stupid vain glory item Nope only idiots will buy this Perfect mobile gaming device 😎 What is that game at 712 That39s one expensive cutting board try tab s9 ultra Just wondering if this video is sponsored by Apple I have to mention that as a designerartist who is upgrading to this tablet with a tradein I39m getting the 1200eur 13quot 512gb wifi model I can knock off half of it with a trade in and it pays for itself in about a weekfortnight so its definitely worth it for me The 3k version is a little nuts though I just can39t justify it for myself in any way It39s nothing more than a portable mini cintiq tho now with better features than a cintiq imho because you have too much money bro thats why you are buying it that and you have the discipline of a child Apple needs to take a note from Samsung’s DEX and just make a button that flips to MacOS Watching this nice piece of electronic on my GREAT Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 plus OLEDSCREEN 😅  Re Design Arun you missed the mark with this one in my opinion I feel like this video is more of an excuse for you personally to get an ipad iPad hardware is stopped by its software It is not there yet I have never spent more than 80 dollars on any kind of device Oof I wasn39t expecting to hear someone wanting to move to apps I39m postapp because they will all be nonfunctional in a few years because the associated services are gone or their servers have been breached and your data is out there it doesn39t have a calculator 😔 Why do influencers want us to believe that their tech purchases are “spontaneous” I thought in EU everything is free so you have unlimited cash to buy whatever you like brJoke aside I39m excited for the new ipad pro It works perfectly for tethering with my sony camera for quick capture and the screen brightness is just a god sent in many situations Instead of having the Keyboard stuck underto the screen I like to use a separate BT Keyboard It is more ergonomic if you place the Pad on sth high up  and I have no use for a touchpad The Problem with Apps is you can39t roll back to an older version without an extra software on a PC or Mac Apps do not always get better and some are much worse then older versions Also to handle one file ON the iPad from on app to  another App to another App is a pain You end up with duplicates It is better when you have a central cloud drive I know people who are knee deep in Apple but still say you can39t work with the iPad it is a toy  a very capable toy  When you can work with it you must have a very good fitting app or an online workflow How would you compare the Tab S9 Ultra with the Ipad Pro 13quot M4 2024 Please do not use an iPhone instead a Galaxy Phone Please I spent 2383 with taxes a hrefUCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV11UJgKsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAga but upgrading from my 2018 I think it will be worth it Almost 2500 This is including the Apple Magic Keyboard and Pencil which comes separately First the Apple Vision Pro and now this Soon Apple will retail their Pro Max series at 1400 for their base model and call it justified because of all their “new apple” features I thought Samsung’s Galaxy Ultra Tab series was expensive at 1300 for 12gb Ram and 512gb of storage which is enough for most peoplebrbrEdit People these days think expensive  High qualitybrLower price  Straight up horrible quality Unless they change what else you can do in the next version of iPad OS 18 I rather see myself grabbing a 13quot MacBook Air for about 23 the price of the iPad Pro with Keyboard brI already have a 2020 iPad Pro and find myself constantly hitting barriers that make doing things cumbersome And somethings are just not possible at all from a developer

calculator tho samsung introducing dex back in  idk probably 20 yrs agobrApple today we39ve reinvented the tablet experience by making a desktop mode D Consumers don´t care if they spent 3000 on a tablet they are the ones to blame because they spend thousands on Apple devices and subscriptions and by so rising the price bar and cost for future Apple products brbrApple is probably laughing at consumers waiting for jerryrigeverything to bend it🤣🤣 definitely this ipad very good for gaming pubg mobile MKBHD is a good reviewer and I usually watch his videosbrbrBut  Mrwhoosetheboss is the best Apple reviewer I can39t deny but MKBHD39s Apple reviews aren39t honest and nonconstructive sort of biased But Arun really judges these mediocore Apple products Imagine paying 3 grand for a tablet that doesn39t have a calculator😂 Reply to the title Because you earn enough money to spend on that thing 😂 My tablet cost 7900br I39m watching you video on it😼 why Because you have way too much money  Simple hahaha Day 2 of asking Mrwhosetheboss to send me a gaming laptop I use OneDrive on my iPad and Macbook for easy transition between PC and mac It39s definitely helped sometimes the syncing is slow but it39s a good way for the carryover without having to pick one or the other Airpods Pro is the only Apple product I own I’m very careful with my electronics but once when I was a kid I got my first iPad I was playing on it while laying on the bed and it slipped off and smashed I hid it from everyone and continued to use it lol I regret not saying anything since it was likely under warranty This video sounds like when you try to convince your parents to buy you a ipad lol I was thinking the same when M1 iPad came out and I bought it back then brIt39s laying in my drawer most of the time nowbrApps are cool and all but then I get into situations where my bank asks to log on with a pc browser to complete the task The iPad is hindered by its operating system I hate my iPad Pro The worst decision I39ve made on an electronic device saying that samsung sucks only cuz they use mobile chips is like saying that there is no good android device believe it or not snapdragon is kinda the king Hes going to be so upset about the battery life comnig from a 16mbp Waste of money they removed the ultrawide camera and mmw 5G Doesn’t seem like much of an upgrade from my M2 iPad Pro The reality is that Apple will keep youisheeps buying their overpriced tech They are selling a brand and not innovation Bro you can39t do coding and programming in it Don39t buy this🚮 Love the set Looks very cinematic you somehow managed to convince me that this year iPad Pro is very worth the price lol 🤔🤔🤔 Shoutout to all the Jeff Bezos39 who will enjoy this product 😅 I love my iPad Definitely my all

you mentioned just about fine and while yes some will do worse some will be better People who don’t like iPads have never used one I was in that situation a year ago and now my iPad Air is my most

Getting tired of Arun saying how much money he spends on things What I do is I bring phone and iPad to places on the car I use iPad if not driving and if like I work I use laptop Fun fact if an

Apple products and maintaining a solid business relationship with them is an important part of your own business strategy as a tech influencer 2 It39s a business expense  you claim the money back😂🙃 still no Instagram for ipad I39d really love to pick one up but the cost is just not within reach for me at the moment I bought my 512gb 129 inch pro new when it came out in 2017 First pro motion

the time its basically the same thing only they have more control like push notificationsbrId rather have bookmarks than apps that just take up space for applications that require internet connection to use anyways Dude thinks the iPad just became a laptop replacement in 2024 while everything he mentions is already there since 6 years 😂 Eh the trackpad is fine I don39t care that it isn39t as big it works better than the Macbook trackpad  I basically find the Macbook trackpad to be about 30 effective compared to a Windows laptop I always use my Logitech MX Master S3 alwaysbrbrI need to be able to run macOS apps on the iPad Pro to upgrade to the latest one  I have had every iPad Pro since release until they switched to the Mseries chips  I can39t justify it until I can use it and not bring my Macbook with me  I have been pretty close to this in the past by remoting into computers that I leave at home  I do find many of the iOS apps better than the macOS versions  But I would prefer to have the full Microsoft Office experience I need a full install of Visual Studio Code and be able to load related dev tools  I don39t need it to be powerful I just need to develop and push the code it

video before even buying I can39t wait until JerryRigEverything does the bend test on this iPad He39s gonna have a great time watching this thing turn into a book I disagree with him I have used an  iPad as an Laptop replacement and need to admit that I couldn‘t live like this You are so restrained with what apps you use and for me most times iPad Apps are way worse than their Laptop counterpart and there are many Phone Apps you can‘t even usedownload for the iPad the port story is a whole other story I can‘t have the jerky haptics with the touchpad and the keyboard I am missing my desktop its more difficult to use dokuments and save them the files app is an absolute menace the OS is cleaner and you have more possibilities browsing works way better you can have addons much more easily and in general the only real benefit you have is the touchscreen Imo if you really want that pen and touchscreen and try to replace your mac you should look into some of the microsoft counterparts that offer a much better compromise of laptop and tablet I for example like the Lenovo X1 as much as I agree that apple products are of superior quality I also have a very hard time agreeing with their prices And we the people keep fueling their drive to increase prices because we quotmustquot have and show off our apple products You use all the smart tech to compensate for your lack of smarts WHAT THE SHELL WEREE YOU DOING TO YHAT TOOTH BRUSH is there a calculator tho Bruh just buy a Windows tablet with good specs and be happy I already have an M2 ipad pro and in my head watching this

Tablet Goes On Ultimate Gaming Tablet Why does every YouTuber assume that most people39s daily work involves video editing photo editing and drawing arts 😅 While in reality for most of us the real value of an iPad is most likely entertainment consumption making the iPad Pro completely overkill for most not to mention the price  Moreover a 13 IPad Pro  Magic Keyboard might still weigh more than a MBA 13 Or writing MS teams Outlook note taking research  All with a long battery pen and cellular data  It’s like some of these people have never worked an office job  It might be overkill but if I’m using it all day I want the nice display and premium build Why would you want nano coating which diminishes deep true black OLED Crazy You have GAS First of all good video But now my experience

be a personal companion robot able to manage and solve half the problems in my life to be worth that much money Is it just me or are those guys at apple slowly lose the grip on reality You can buy tools for that kind of money that can let you work in many fields Also apps are mostly web based services anyway So a clunky website is what you are using in many apps as well Creators say the same shit every time a new iPad Pro drops No it’s not replacing your laptop because it can’t run the software your laptop can run and without the software support I don’t care if it has an M9000 chip inside it’s not replacing a computer Mobile games are NOT games If you want to play games then play them on Windows or Linux and if you want them mobile then get them on one of Windows handhelds or the Steam Deck I have replaced my Windows PC with an iPad with external screen and keyboard but it doesn39t work so well the external keyboard fails every day so I have to use the quotonscreen keyboardquot or move the app from one screen to the other screen and back again to get the keyboard working again It’s the accessories that come with the iPad that makes it so addicting and yet the S24U has more power The push for thinner and thinner devices is awful  It just makes them less repairable and easier to damage so you need a case and thus any advantage of the thinness is gone No matter how much powerful Apple makes their iPads it will NEVER be a laptop just due to how much apple limits their iPad OS to be just a bigger phone UI rather than something that has close to laptop functionality with software capable enough to run MacOS games and tabs while also having the capability to use it as a big PhoneTablet with its form factor kinda like Samsung Dex and its OneUI OS

college note taking but that hardware is clearly capable of more Why can39t l boot it into macOS or Linux and run desktop programs This could genuinely replace the laptop and the desktop for a lot of

good Please help me to select from 11 and 13 inch ipad pro because you39re loaded 😉 iPad should be able to switch to MacOS when ever you want would be a massive feature people have been oblivious to Apple39s amazing design plan  Opposite to what Windows did trying to merge tablet and laptop design with windows 8 in one quick update Apple has slowly been merging the two platforms over the past decade slowly  Genius really iPad Pro should run OSX period Apple introducing a button on their pencil as revolutionary while Samsung had the button for literally forever This is Apples version of an all in one laptop That toothbrush broll looked so wrong… Crazy amount to spend in consolidating devices and reduce weight 🤔 Apple sellout😔 Sorry but iOS still sucks and is the main thing that holds

it all boils down to what do you want to use it for As a web designer  developer the iPad simply does not produce the kind of efficiency I derive from my MacBook Pro That said it39s fantastic if I am on the go to work on copywriting or even researching I probably won39t get it but as I travel more who knows me watching this on my tablet that costed 120 when i came out back in 2019 I can buy a nice car in my country with thatbrOrbrI can pay 100 Months of rent No joke but 1 room thobrwith thisbrand its gonna end up in hands of a kid watching cocomelon only appeling this is the OLED 120 hz screen 😂😂 I wanna be invited to your wedding Aron😢 I39d rather have the same chassis and same size battery that lasts longer with the efficient M4 than a thinner iPad with a smaller battery with the same battery life For almost four grand just get a 3000 grand macbook and an iPad air  apple pencil brI39m sorry but owning an M1 iPad pro 129quot myself just shows how little it can do I can39t do my school homework on this thingbrAs others are saying it39s going to be the fastest iPad For watching netflix and taking notes lolbrbrIf I somehow get over the pricetag my M1 iPad gets really hot when using note taking apps 3rd party or not I would like to see a thermal camera pointed at this thing after hours of usage  As someone who has never owned a tabletipad before this review has given me a better perspective on the things that matter when buying one Buy the Samsung It39s much better thewonderofyou1 gonna take a look at it 👀 The tab S9 FE can be a laptop if wanted I feel like this apple quotinnovationquot is only to get more money out of consumers Sure gamechanging if you like microtransaction I use an iPad everyday for work it has power but there’s nothing to use that power other than the very specific apps they showcase they really need to give it PC capabilitiesbrFor some specific things ur gonna want to find workarounds Google drive is basically useless Whatever you gotta tell yourself Waiting for JerryRigEverything to do the durabillity test iPad Pros always make MacBooks seem like a good deal can do more at a lower price NIce toothbrush  such a load of shit… lmao  More useless than a phone that fits in your pocket and more useless than a gaming laptop yet more expensive than both combinedbrLet me guess another 8 gigs would bump the price to 5k iPad Pro M4 Hands on  Why I just bought itbrCONTENT iGlad was actually very good 😂😂😂 ipad pro has a very serious problem with keyboard cover it is much heavier than macbook air but it is nowhere as a productivity device I had thought I would draw and take notes a lot on it but in the end it is just collecting dust Don39t make the same mistake as I do 😭 Maybe Apple designed this so it could become a laptop replacement for content creators That is free publicity for the ipad line which was otherwise dying Most other people who use macbooks can39t really replicate their workflows on ipad brbrOne last consideration for children and teenagers ipad sucks wet arse It does not give them the freedom to explore all the opportunities computing has to offer Imagine learning how to code your first mod for a game on an ipad You can39t On PC not only can you get amazing games like Stalker GAMMA for free and legally but also all the tools you need to star making your own mods And then we have the thing that will really kill it the excel mobile app sucks wet arse Arun this is not new to ipad most of these commands already available on the previous ipad I have the 2021 ipad pro and don39t see a reason to upgrade iPad OS is deliberately hamstrung by apple Except for niche cases I find it hard to justify a lot of the upgrades in apple That smart brush part was sus😂 sorry this is boring its just like an ad bye I don39t really see the point how often do you really go out and edit a video or draw something or just watch YouTube where it can39t wait until you come back home to your pc or your phone isn39t enough No way bro uses an 8 terabyte laptop Issue is the same as with the quotoldquot ones I have an m1 ipad so its already still quite powerfull i love it but for entertainment I felt always to limited for the stuff i do Especially when it comes to file system adjusting different windows having the look and feel of a real operating system having the precision of a mouse or the touchpad limits of ports for extra hardware  but also where the ports are located on the ipad When they solve it with the new Keyboard than it is still couple of others which would bother me in daily life Alos some software isn39t just there yet or available for mobile phone but is horrible on the ipad The appleangst that you would not buy an macbook kills the device on productivity terms Apple didn39t do enough for me to just a new one Recommend you to watch Videos why people have return to macbooks on older ipad models and ask yourself are their CONs also important for you Because on paper an ipad sounds like a great piece of tech Just use a Samsung tab s9 ultra I39m having so much trouble keeping up with technology Stop pretending the iPad has become a PC replacement It still has a mobile phone OS with another namebrbrI have a Pro 2018 and it’s no different Apple buyout him can39t wait to see jerryrigeverything bend it man made me feel poor bro really said ima 8 tb  guy and 2tb idk how to manage storagebrbrbri have 500gb on my laptop Dude I39m buying a fullon RV that works and runs for 3K 😂😂😂 My 2018 iPad Pro died recently The display stopped working The backlight still works just no display I suspect it was because over the years it got bent a little I was waiting to order the new pro but after seeing the 1339 is 51 mm  I decided to just get the 1339 iPad Air I was really looking forward to the oled screen on the pro but there39s no way it doesn39t get bent And I have a M1 Max MacBook Pro for serious work Less performance from what will be lowest end chip in the m4 lineup much more expensive but because it weighs all of a single kilogram less than a macbook pro that39s enough to justify buying one I think Arun just wants new and shiny If it wasn39t for the fact that Procreate is an amazing drawing tool not to say Procreate Dreams to animate I39d never buy one of these Marques on the other hand I mean its alright overrated as fuck in my opinion 😐🙄 i prefer websites over app anytime Light slowly reduced in your hotel room after the sun went down  It happens to me all the time when I use natural light and I have to increase ISO I was the biggest critic when the ipad was first introduced I just couldn39t see the use of it Fast forward to now I39m just about to go on a business trip and i39ve never been away from my ipad It39s gotten powerful enough to do a lot of misc work and it39s very portable when compared to a laptop The battery is good better than laptop and the screen is amazing It is my daily driver and it goes with me everywhere I39ve questioned about getting a 13quot since it feels unwieldy but with the light weight M4 i may need to reconsider brbrOn the battery topic even if it has 2 OLED panels the battery may be the same because OLED is extremely power efficient since it39s capable of shutting off individual pixels to save energy where as LCD cannot and that could translate to why battery life is still equivalent to the old model It39s also why the contrast is also much better as black is true black hows life as a tiktok influencer build a home that can survive without electricity from the grid there is a Carrington event in our near future 20252035 Here’s the reason iPad will NEVER replace my MacBook MUSIC As in Proper music  CD ripping so I have good quality and not streaming crap My own collection of 500GB worth on my MacBook which I sync to my iPhone iPad and IPod classic in the car The IPad won’t be able to do that because Apple haven’t given a shit about iTunes and proper music collections as they want to push everyone to pay for casual streaming Which I refuse to do Until Apple actually give credence to those of us who put them where they are  as in music collectors then iPad will never replace the mac They removed the ultra wide camera and 3 studio quality mics Like wtf My issues with tech reviews these days is that they are biased if APPLE releases a tablet it get its own review reponse but if it is samsung or other tech companies they do not make this much effort i have no idea if its because APPLE is more appealing or what but to be honest they far better tablets then this but these top tech reviewers will never review at all and its just not Mrwhosetheboss mostly Marques as a tech fan I am highly disappointed in you guys recently feel like APPLE has bought to review their products using you guys as their bridge to marketing It39s funny that your conclusion was towards the laptop over the tablet because I was the opposite I hated having a laptop when a tablet does everything aayee yoooo Double check the price The squeeze comes from galaxy pens 🤣 I dont39 agree at all with Arun paying 3600 USD is crazy  may be he needs a wedding gift from Apple  Cringe hyper consumerism What the hell happened to you building the biggest iPhone challenge man i hate apple why am i even here Wow This is the worst review of your channel now Imagine justifying a 3000 dollar tablet and how thoughtprovoking it is lmao Sellout Obsene amount for tabletsbut people will go to obsene lenghts to buy new ipads as usual My laptop that can run Forza Horizon 5 and RDR2 was 1200CAD😅 also no Unreal Engine on it is a deal breaker lol Waste of money When you can afford it any device can become worth it lol cause shit if why would anyone think twice about a small minute feature or con when they can afford it Yeah but the Magic Keyboard im currently using V1 I assume does exactly the same thing Like… what I actually wish the released a physical ruler that is compatible with the ipad That would’ve been better And why is it just with this iPad that you say it can replace your laptop What do these new iPads do compared to the previous 23 generations I39ll tell you absolutely nothing because iPad OS nerfs any hardware Oh no it’s gonna snap My car is worth less xd THEY STILL DIDNT CHANGE THE APPLE PEN TIP AND ITS LIKE AN ICE PICK SAMSUNGS IS SMOOTH AS BUTTER AND OFC THEY ACTUALLY INCLUDE THE PEN iPad OS  sucks  don39t ever think it will replace your Laptop Because I bought and iPad Pro about four years ago for that all the iPad OS releases later it hasn39t changed At the end you go back to the macOS because it actually lets you do things Just remember We still do not have dynamic albums in Photos on iPad OS We do not have multiple accounts and so on  Just to let you know guys the Apple service center does not repair iPads once they are out of the warranty period If something happens to your iPad after the warranty has expired you will need to either buy a new one or get it repaired at your local repair shop We have a few tablets at one time we used them as a more portable laptop I liked the larger screen All that being said we really never use them anymore  I turn mine on once in a while so it backs up my information but that39s it  Some games are better on the tablet but not so much better that I actually get up and go get the tablet  Heck I hardly ever use my laptop at this point maybe once a month when I pay bills this was just a 16 minute ad only 400k subs left btw him and applebrMEGAA IPHONEE true i feel that apps are better than websites but the problems are sometimes apps are poorly optimized to the point where i wonder if a website would have been much faster at doing the same thing an app could do this is minus the apps that are properly designed and made for their proper purpose sometimes i feel people rely on apps too much and i prefer somethings the old fashion way because it would be more efficient hflee thousand I39m definitely getting the 13inch I padpro I was waiting for over a year for them to release one I felt was worth it This will be my 1st Ipad Very excited Well I was in the exact same position as you when I was about to buy an iPad but I stopped my self and gave myself 2 weeks to really think about getting an iPad  Glad I didn’t because I don’t really have any use for it but people have different preferences and needs Love your videos arun❤ its actually 999 He39s just coping on his purchase at this point 😂 My iPad Pro 129 has been in the drawer for many months The multitasking on the ipad is a juke I have an Android tablet Galaxy Tab 7 for media consumption as the 16x9 aspect ratio is best for me  My wife uses Ipad pro for teaching and note talking The pencil is the most important deiver for usibg an IPad If you do not need the pencil the ipad is of no use for pro users  For work just get a computer Mac of course I think Apple will never allow IpadOS to be a MacOS Equivilant as they want to keep those two products as seperated as they can to make make as much money as they can They would lose too money if people only bought Ipads that could do everything a macbook can I use a 2012 Samsung galaxy note 101 tab in grey I still use for drawings yooo man its actually similar to the thickness of my laptop screen a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6151015a I really hate being asked to download an app I don39t want to have hundreds of apps for things I39ve only used once or twice There is always something missing in ipad OS It is not MacOS Period Been there At the end of the day you regret spending so much money on a quotprofessionalquot device with so many limitations Feels like vw beetle with a twin turbo v8 That fully specced out IPad would cost at least 5000 AUD in Australia New iPads are OK but what I really love is this sweatshirt Does anyone know what brand it is I can39t wait for jerryrigeverything to bully this device😂 i am sad seeing u review the ipad this way i feel they payed u bro the ipad isnt thay good bro mac is better a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt42042a Bratha EWWWW I39ll stick with heresy ensues my Microsoft Surface Pro  best of both worlds Fully functional laptop  tablet  everything The amount of storage you get on the iPad pro is a rip off it only comes with 256MB starting it should start with 1TB and go up from there  This is a pro device with such small storage when storage has only gotten better without a price hike over the past decade and Apple is still screwing us  Getting a iCloud solution is not an option either to pay for storage on a subscription suck and if I want my files ready and available at all times and want to edit them on my device and if the files get too large you will constantly be swapping things from the cloud to the devicebrbr  Everyone has the same attitude it sucks but I got to buy it get a spine stop buying things that need to get with the future Balls Madness at that price this guy just came here to talk up the iPad man all this talk cos you feel like you an write on the iPad lol Yo… relax with that toothbrush Seems like I39m watching more of a advertisement of ipad lol Because thats what it is he sold out again to Apple i wish they still made the simpler phones like they used to i do not need or want a modern smartphone Lightfield handheld XR tablet will be the ultimate You are in for a rude awakening Ipad os will block you here and there in your workflow If you actually need speed precision and consistency you will use a separate mouse instead of a trackpad or a touchscreen If you barely use anything that requires a cursor then those are fine A pencil can work as a comparable substitute but it39s not ideal for everything Lol this doesn39t replace a laptop It is a laptop but now you need to buy your keyboard separately and a new quotmagicquot penicil to use the touchscreen properly Apple are top tier a convincing idiots that innovation is removing functionality The website metions all day battery life 😋 Instead of buying and making iPads and ipencil or whatever the f its called more and more like paper and pencil here’s a crazy idea…wait for the drumroll WHY NOT USE A FREAKING PAPER AND PENCIL  Crazy idea right I know i personally will stick to 300€ laptops and 100€ phones and never upgrade hardware until it breaks beyond repair Yes it is technically the most powerful tablet but comparing pricepreformance with the galaxy S9 tablets why would anyone pay that much money for a tablet How is it worth it Or is this really just apple having a mental grip on it39s users So a 14quot MacBook Pro costs 100 less than a base model iPad Pro 13quot  keyboard Yet the MBP has USB ports thunderbolt HDMI SD reader headphone jack fast charging OH and it also has more RAM double the storage runs a full OS Why the f would you even consider an iPad Useless Can39t run legacy computer software like medical electronic records without support and these Medical EHR companies could care less so we are stuck with laptops and desktops please put MacOS on them  that is what is holding up their progress Do a review of pixel 8a He39s officially joined the team as an Apple sales representative 🤣 If you were reviewing a pickup truck would you complain because you have 2 kids and a wife to drive around and a truck with a bed in the back is dumb I would never use it I just don39t see the point of having a bed in the back of the truck If I compare it to a Honda Civic the Honda makes more sense Or are they different vehicles for different purposes The ipad is useless It39s a niche product and people who bought them are trying to justify their purchase Damn you throated that toothbrush Currently watching this on my firstgen iPad Pro that I’ve used in lieu of a proper computer since 2019 😂 I will join the club when the ipad can actually run Mac OS and ipad OS a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt3003a HAKKI ABİİİİİİ So apple just released their version of the MS surface pro well actually thats very Apple

the same issue with EVERY new iPad release in the last 45 years For a device to be ‘Pro’ we need to be able to freely install programs that are specific to our use case The longer we’re limited to the App Store the longer this is basically a giant iPhone brBeing thinner and having additional performance isn’t of interest to ‘pros’ as it literally can’t be utilised iPad sales are dropping because consumers aren’t been listened toobrIf you own an M1 iPad what’s the point in upgrading when the specs bumps are barley utilised due to software limitations 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️ I love my iPad Air for college but I will NEVER use a Mac because my Microsoft laptop is more powerful and a bit more intuitive with the software that I have to use iPad for notes laptop for everything else These iPads are actually so sick brI’ve always wanted one for school or art its like a pseudolaptop phone Ah following the MrBeast sudden video ending strat Smart Annoying but smart lmao DO IT The M4 chip is 20 faster than the M3 chip You make allot of good points about app integration and design It does seem like developers think about the apps first over the website Especially with smart home technology This is just a video of him convincing himself Why he should buy the ipad wish they just kept the width but got rid of the camera bump So much copium This video was just mrwhostheboss justifying dropping stupid money for a tablet Dude has money watch the video and give him more I have an m1 ipad pro 11quot and it39s got terrible battery life and always has  Funny how Apple says literally nothing about battery improvements over the years because there are none I have fallen on this hype so many times and ended up using my Mac for everyday use and having an ultrapowerful M2 iPad for watching Amazon video and Youtube  Not again  Interesting video though iGlad just sounds wrong 😂😂😂 Night is falling during shooting 😀 Sponsored by apple Bro said “why I just bought it” as a title How are people still putting up with these semiprofessional marketers Imma be honest buying an iPad now as anyone else but an artist swearing on Procreate is stupid Sorry It39s true It will be interesting to see if they update iPad os at the summer event Errrr regards storage have you not ever considered a nas drive They literally just need to enable cursor use with a mouse for precision and better compatibility with morequotproquot stuff Than the ipad would attend almost everyone For the first time I thought I would see in ending this video was directed by apple edited on ipad Watching this on my 57mm 580gr 124quot Galaxy Tab S9 512GB  1TB Microsd First take from a serious and thoughtful gadget reviewer about using the iPad as an allinone device that replaces the macbook as well Brilliant Can’t wait to hear more about the journey and also what’s cooking in the AI department at WWDC Boooo Apple boooo I recently got the previous gen iPad Pro 109 inch 1TB and it feels good enough to where I don’t need a laptop I prefer an iPad over a laptop simply because of the versatility that a laptop does not have Laptops require a keyboard while an iPad can rest comfortably almost anywhere if the case as a little stand on it I can be lazy in bed in multiple positions while still doing productive things on my iPad where as with a laptop I need to always be upright For the amount of versatility I get I can trade a little functionality which is exactly what the iPad is So you wanna work from your bed you might just end up like the humans in Walle 😂😂😂 I completely agree Versatility is what a laptop or even a macbook has just for the OS  if your job is just checking emails and basic web browsing then you really don39t need the latest tech for that It really depends on what work you do Watching videos some Excel or basic work that can be done on phone can be done on iPad too But not every pc work can be done on ipad Same here JishinimaTidehoshi well it can certainly be a plus to be lazy every once in a while it’s more than just an excuse to stay in bed lol Why they have downgraded the camera Almost everything he says about the new one applies to the prior one too I have tried to use the Ipad as a MacBook replacement but had failed time and again So I39ve kind of given up hope on the IPad I am exited for ip68 and Qi2 i iPadbrDo we have in new ipad pro 😅 JerryRig  wow its a foldable ipad 💀 Mmmm… have you ever used a PC It would do everything a Mac or an iPad does without the limitations you’re mentioning At half the price How could this slimmest fanless body handles the heat of extremely powerful M4 with 1600 nits brightnessbriPhone pro brAnd MacBook air can39tbr😂 I spent 2900 on my last car used Apple scares me Of course casual youtube content creators can replace their computers with an iPad easily Software engineers like myself cannot replace their macs with a silly toy like the iPad equipped with glorified iOS Thank you If an iPad can easily replace your mac then you didn39t need a mac in the first place Not worth the upgrade in fact not even an upgrade People save ur money use it on something better like a vacation Let it hurt Tim Cooks pockets he has never been innovative all about profits quotNetflix is better on this platform because the latter is so restrictivequot is an Ltake that will not have me switch to that platform anytime soon Wow I shocked when I heard the price That39s why Apple revenue getting drop because of the price of their products getting higher and higher and get less i39m good with what i have New iPads are a boon for Graphics Designers Digital Artists and Animators 😊 shockingly like 2 year old Samsung but still lacking Replace your laptop Rally Why now This doesn’t do anything more laptop than the old one its just nicer Nothing about this more productive than that last model The weight of the iPad has been reduced to work better with the new Magic Keyboard  The old design made the iPad and keyboard combo feel top heavy That won’t be the case now If Apple didn’t tell you there was any difference you would not even notice a single difference between the old iPad Pro and this new one Also 99 of people do not need the pencil squeezing technology The problem with the iPad is thus it has almost laptop capable hardwear but uses tablet softwear Something about this guy makes me love watching his channelbrbrThe urge to buy this  and never use a laptop again 🫠 The only reviewer that is not shooting Apple directly in the heart 😁 Imagine spending all that money right now  for it to be cheaper  after few

Mac but doesn’t require a cooling fan Okay Arun when you say “damn” it doesn’t mean the same thing The problem with iPad pro is not with power or screen size is the os I use my tablet to watch youtube when my phone is dying lol Why What39s the obsession with THINNER devices As an influential tech reviewer can you not hold Apple accountable instead for majority customer feedback where people ask for longer battery life and more durability for the Pro models Honestly happy with my 109 IPad from 2022 see you in 202627 for a true upgrade I think that all those new iPads are overpowered for what39s actually possible to do with those devices I39ve been making music on my Air from 2020 edit videos directly from SSD while have lots of apps opened at the same time What I want to say is that you want to pay a price of a small car to do what you can already do for the 13 of the price with older devices D iPad will NEVER be a computer iOS is still an inferior OS It is not Mac and it is not Windows With stretched iPhone apps that shows exactly the same amount of content no matter the screen size Bro had to make a entire video to give himself a shred of validation before spending 3k on a ipad

scene or a green screen The reflection in the window tells me it39s real but the quality of the image screams highend green screen It39s beautiful and disturbing at the same time😅 Enjoy your videos but nothing you39ve said justifies spending almost 3000 on an overpriced iPad instead of a MacBook Pro or a Lenovo Legion Pro I just realized your primary phone is s24 ultra 😂 Eh It39s an overpriced Apple product with limited function Usually love your reviews and the editing is top notch as always but I feel like this is completely tone deaf spending 3600 bucks on a tablet that is so so limited in functionality to a traditional PC saying that quotthe only thing PCs have over mobile operating systems is the filesystemquot etc just seems like you haven39t really used a computer before You need the  1tb or 2tb to get the new screen He39s actually convincing himself to buying one lol Waiting for Samsung to drop their thin version now Would never get apple products Can39t even game on those mac books how the hell did you get that Good for you I think the new iPads suit your needs and it would definitely worth for you to purchase one However when we think about majority of the users most will never use the pro apps and the spec bump is absolutely useless for them The main thing that needs change is iPadOS because why do we have that much power if most can39t even use it Slap macOS on it and it would absolutely sell Even if the samsung tab s9 ultra is very weak compared this I would take it any day if I don39t have workload that REALLY requires pro iPad appsAndroid has good selection of pro apps too I think you made this video to convince yourself to pay £3K for a tablet 😂 Don’t do itbr you got the remarkable to be less app distracted br so many iPhone apps do not have iPad parody br So many Mac apps have a dork iPad version br using FCPX on iPad is like the guy who’s trying to eat a 3 course meal from the middle seat in economy classbrbrI foresee a regret video in your future If the pro is so thin there39s like no point in buying an air since the pro is thinner anyway The only difference is the price But at that point wouldn39t you just buy a normal iPad Since the air and normal have like the same specs now😭🙏 I disagree with your take on tablets being the end goal over laptops but I do think that you are correct in saying that more portable devices with touch and nice build quality are the way to go Most people probably don’t need a keyboard with the effectiveness of swipe typing voice gestures and app design I do wish Apple would allow macOSUNIX

iPad Pro and have had it for 3 years Our school recommended we get MacBooks when we get to year 10 because the work load if a lot more and I’ve started to see why Would you anyone reading this recommend I get this IPad a MacBook or anything else Or even just to stick with what I have now I’ve discussed with my parents and they’re willing to help me pay for a MacBook but if I were to get this iPad I would have to save for a bit longer So yeh what would yous recommend Not excited at all Bagus itu saya suka💕👍 I can buy a used iMac m1 for cheaper lol TBH my iPad Pro 1gen would like to

iPads are a different type of device which have touch screens It39s a different use case I personally love the tactile experience of a tablet Great device Good job Apple So basically they copied s8 ultra from 3 years ago and aaded some new stuff to it and tripled the price iPad is so expensive he has to make two videos to afford it One to talk about buying it and all it can do and one where he actually has it and says it’s great but not amazing The file storage system on ipadOS is super annoying My work around was storing all my files on Google Drive and it was a painful experience trying to save and open files on my tablet It39s a strange place for Apple to have a ton of friction everything else is superior to a laptop Best mainstream tech  guy ever You escaped the bullshiting We all just Witnessed the down fall of Apple How much are Youtubers going to try to push users to buy overpriced tech that is hardly upgraded from previous generation and usecase for tablet remains watching

me this small changes are huge specially talking about the Pencil PRO With a display make it amazing But really spending 36k on a tablet let39s not kid ourselves that39s what an iPad really is when you could buy a decent windows laptop which would probably have an equal if not better performance and a phone for that total price is quite redundant It does have it39s place in a niche of someone like for you but that39s the same niche for the Xperia phones Yes they39re great but would the normal person require that no That being said the sheep are still going to buy this piece of hardware they won39t even use 1 of and tout it as the best purchase ever That39s what pisses me off like I can afford it but do I want to buy it no wait what happened to i make a phone if we overtake apple youtube channel  I find that I really have very little use for laptops and iPads though I have desktops everywhere and their 32quot screens make anything smaller seem frustrating But our family has almost a dozen iPads The kids live on them and never watch TV Samsung tab s9 ultra is better This iPad Pro will be my first iPad Got the 13 inch I am definitely hyped I love your channel but think you are off on this video I love Apple and all their products but right now I have imessage signal todos firefox and watching your video in a window on my mac  Can I do that on the ipad yet No and I think that is what you are missing which is so strange  Still love ya but this video was way off  To prove my point lock your laptop up for a week and only use the ipad  Within 24 hours you will realize its not a replacement yet  Now that would be a great video to see you do It’s feel like apple innovate nothing but only increases price that’s it Me watching this realising i will probabily wont get itHmm interesting Arun you are a tech legend You are wrong in replacing your laptop if you are a Power User IPAD39s are useless for power userstinkers  Great for artists gamers and still very limited and too much for office users Even the macbook is getting on my nerve with all the Apple co limitations they impose Every OS update Apple pushes kills further apps we use for years because Apple doesn39t support legacy software And they make it difficult to install converters emulators etc Even Windows emulation on Parallels doesn39t run all programs you39d expect on an actual Windows machine I cringe every time someone talks about replacing their laptop with a tablet what Apple wants The day Apple makes a notebook become iPad OS then its the day I leave Apple for good Still like my S9 ultra Apple said Your next computer is not a computer Stillnot a computer with ipad OS 😅 this is for now just a really high end thing but i am very excited for when this advanced tablet tech becomes less expensive and more widely spread with more low end devices with similar uses as well ive been using a surface pro 9 for a few days now and ive fallen in love with the uses and mobility though in general i would wait for a tablet running on android just for the software freedom that ios doesnt have Kill iPadOS Or add macOS i still havent used my M1 ipad for anything else than meetings and youtube videos The M4 is nice but useless in this form factor Even the M1 is overkill for what its being used by most people 🎶 Never gonna switch to iPad never gonna let my MacBook down This video is basically and ad That is not what I was expecting from you Pure disappointment Samsung Tablet incoming Will it bend JerryRigEverything  Watching from Xiaomi Pad 6 😂😂😂 Please retire the puns 😭 Until the ipad supports multiple user logins it ain39t a pc and worse it39s a security risk I like the lighting change when moving from daylight to night  Good continuity Arun39s videos had became so good that words can39t describe😊😊😊 Respect 🥰🥰🥰 Literally me watching his video though I can39t affordhis speaking and reviews makes me want to watch him 😆 Yeah i dont use CRapple products not worth it  Hi 👋🏻 Is this a wedding invite for your 185 mil subscribers Crazy that an iPad is faster than my brand new iMac lol Could you review the samsung galaxy tab s9 Apple destroys samsung in the tablet market a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt9471547a bro the iPad 8th gen that I’m using rn which is great btw has 32 GBS of storage I didn’t even know 8TB was a thing 😂 The iPad OS is limited compared to MacOS Replacing your laptop with the iPad it would be stupid Lol I just need to know how my 4K HDR  UHD media will run on it He is conflicted What i only hate about ipads is the GB for its price Feels like video is shot on phone Samsung better stepup thier game with thier next tab they better use the new snapdragon new PC chip that smart toothbrush scene caught me offguard hahaha damn near choked on my coffee I have that toothbrush and it39s not really that smart It recognizes when you39re applying too much pressure to your teeth but that39s it Everything else is poorly optimized You don’t know about the oral b IO line up Can I have your MacBook then please 😂 Laptop gt Tablet did u mean harmonyOs from Huawei Screen made by Samsung 😂😂 None of these products laptop tablets etc are supposed to replace the other They supplement based on what you are doing A tablet with a keyboard will not really replace a laptop full time A laptop will not replace a tablet full time Example when you are lying in bed and don39t want the glare of a big TV before sleeping you would rather use a tablet to watch media before going to sleep You don39t need a keyboard of mouse for that use Another usage is when you are wanting to watch your content on a flight Laptop is when you want to do some serious work either on a desk or even on your bed and especially when you want to type more They all have their place  There is no point in even discussing how one can replace the other im broke 🤣 I’m the opposite of your intro I used to never think a tablet was necessary since i had a MacBook but the laptop has typical laptop issues For example for years it keeps telling me i have no memory space when theres like nothing stored on it Ipads are more portable and can do everything a MacBook can do Now I rarely open my MacBook Ipad is from 2018 so I’ll trade it in and upgrade It’s 2600 hundred in the USA if you get the highest spec with the 350 keyboard and the Apple Pencil pro and 2700 if you include coating still expensive but not 3600 hundred expensive iPad only 2tb is 2300 Point is the prices in the uk when converted to dollars is crazy 😂 You39re coming up with wayyyy too many excuses for this pointless iPad Os device it39s ridiculous Just get an older cheaper iPad if you want and you39ll still be good No need to waste money on an over kill social media device

same pile of bull as always So is their greed because they are forcing you to get new accessories Yeah thanks for the video I was actually contemplating getting a higher performance tablet for work not editing videos and now I know it definitely won39t be this one D Why he just bought it Because he has a  lot more money than me Okay These prices are stupid People just keep paying these stupid prices and as long as people keep paying they will keep raising the prices This economy is doomed a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt524844a WHY DOES SOMEONE HAVE AN ANDROID IN AN APPLE SHOWROOM No hate i use android instead of apple but still The fact that a tablet compares to laptops is a jump forward Man with all this power wish you code on it 0 When a product tells me to use their app 🤮 People in Congo are dying for this It39s not worth it Also no one can afford this in this economy Bro made an essay just for him to justify a meaningless purchase Bro we over here in Bidens economy We can39t afford those I cant wait for Jerry Rig Everything reviews for this device🙂 My 2018 iPad just gave out after accidentally spilling soda in the charging port not even 7 days ago so I’m excited to upgrade but I am so overwhelmed with trying to find what’s best for my needs 😩 A review for fellow Youtubers Just get a cheap iPad and everything what he said will still work on that cheap device don39t even bother spending 5 times the amount just to be able to do the same thing that you can on a device 5 times cheaper then it And with the spare money Get an actual Mac laptop and do all your mac os tasks there No need to buy a device ridiculously expensive just to browse and view social media or better yet Save your money and forget what the guy in the video says he39s got plenty of money to burn 12000 dhs is crazy This is the dumbest single video of mrwhosetheboss brPls Mr you can39t replace the laptop because in iPadOS Lightroom is cut down version photoshop davinci resolve is super cut down version brAnd you can39t even resolve theoretical power of M4 Gluck gluck ‘n’ that toothbrush mate Icant wait until you overtake Apple in subscribers I absolutely loved the background with the sun setting Just another reason to love the videos 🌇 Now compare this with the Xiaomi Pad 7 pro value wise when it comes out Thank you Apple Now I admire my decision of buying the Samsung Tab S9 because it really is perfect for me ❤ like laptops with detachable keyboard have never existed D Watching this on my 3 year old Samsung tablet with OLED and 5mm thick Great to see Apple catching up 😂 oh and it cost £269 if the ipdad only works with their own keyboard then this will be a new lawsuit similar to the apple watch one Well Mrwhosetheboss married an apple user and became one in less than a year Pimp one out in Australia and it39s over 5K AUD I actually use mine to draw on Procreate and it can39t handle alot of the images I draw now it crashes and has restrictions due to the hardware constantly is full too with the drawings No upgrade anytime soon without winning the lotto lol oh and I dropped my pencil once and now it39s a bit hit and miss iPad Pro Now serving MacBook Airs for breakfast no lol this thing can barely run YouTubebrnow that I think about it it can39t even run YouTube \\u200b3mar00ss6 are you high 3mar00ss6lmao what i have ipad pro from 20192020 and still works as new and can do everything This isnt android As someone who uses their MacBook Air to edit videos taken on my phone and upload to Instagram I don’t think so It would be a pain in the ass to make a 10 combined video and picture post using iPadOS after having edited the videos even if it were technically possible iPadOS just sucks egymagnet oh ur so clueless lol 3mar00ss6 so you say an iPad can39t run YouTube and you call me clueless That39s rich 🤣🤣🤣 egymagnet lol yes it can39t run YouTube revanced or download videos or change features like you want respect your elders boy or I39ll put you in your place faster than you could put your foot in a size 10 shoe ಡ‿ಡ i weep that tablets suck wish they actually became popular because only apple does good ones Bros actually trynna prove how a 3600 dollar tablet is worth it💀 I just want an iPad with an OLED screen for watching movies music and web browsing I don39t need a power processor I don39t use the Apple Pencil and I don39t need that lidar scanner thingy The iPad has very limited set of uses compared to a laptop  I know I own both I would never in a billion years spend thousands on a tablet And you know it’s not anywhere near as fast as a device with active cooling brbrDid Apple Pay for this coverage Lol quotI can neither confirm nor denyquot🤣 Currently awaiting on the bend test Actually The keyboard should support 2 usb c charging for this price  wow the new IPad pro would make my life so much easier will never be able to afford it but It would make make my life easier that39s for sure If you want Laptop Tablet and Smartphone in one device just use Samsung DEX 👍 Here at 39k likes🎉 No we don39t know what you39re saying because we are NOT on the same page as you at all It39s an iPad you just called out such a minute scale of applicable apps to your basic daily checks as just usable and anything more advanced is still not comparable to the actual laptop at all because iPad os is not Mac os until Apple decides to merge the 2 it is not worth getting an expensive social media browsing device at all And they will not merge ipad and mac os completely because that would eat away and annihilate their profits from their laptop sales so why would they  even though they can due the identical internal chips and hardware that can run arm apps etc They won39t That’s why MKBHD said yeah it’s nice that they made it thinner and a great chip but at its core it’s still just an iPad and expensive bigger phone smh This entire video is extremely biased I think iPadOS is no way close to macOS Now I will wait for part 2 brWhy i returned my iPad Pro 🤫 Apple pays him you really think it39s his own opinions 😒😒 Unfortunately this is just a ridiculous price to pay for a tablet I love my Samsung tab s9 ultra included s pen don39t care for the placement I39ll admit and their folio case was like 150 and damn near replaces my laptop …because you’re a YouTube influencer and that how you make a living Do they bend i like how no one noticed wide cam being removed This boy having first world problems I think he39s losing touch with reality All these “Hurr durr ipad pro overpricedoverpowered youtube facebook device bend gate hulk smash screen me don’t edits videos snort” comments 🙄 Then it’s not for you and was never intended for you That’s like complaining about a McLaren because you only drive to work and pick up groceries IT’S NOT FOR YOU are these people new huawei had these since lockdown The pros are awesome devices but they can only do iPad stuff My m1 pro is still overpowered for what you can do with it This video sounded more like selfjustification than a compelling reason to get an iPad I think you could have always used an iPad for the reasons you39ve mentioned and this new version only improves that marginally I more happy with the Air haha It annoys me this is the best iPad money can buy and it cost way more than Most devicesbrbrBut It39s only for an artists once you buy the 200 pencil Or for work whe you buy a 400 keyboard thing  or a gaming Machine with a controllerbrbrBut we know 99 of people will use this for media consumption  He

world for you don39t be pretentious Please review S9 Ultra or S10 Ultra or even S8 Ultra I like the new Ipad a lot but i don39t think this can be a replacement for the Macbook I guess the connectivity is worse than on the Macbook even tough it has a really great and latest chip laptop chips in generell can consume more power than on tablet So performance wise i think it will be still worse than the m3 pro brbrAnd to the storage problem in the last seconds I39m not sure if you have smth like that but a NAS network attached storage would be a nice option external storage that u can access pretty easily and the upgrade is also easier than upgrading the storage on a macbooklaptop or ipad I love the fact that at the start of the video the sun is setting and in the end it is like midnight The update is meehhhhhhhhh I wonder how much you received from Apple to make this video You39re getting the tablet because a you can afford it and b you39re a top tech reviewer and can39t be left out And c the revenue from this video is what will pay for the Ipad Top not h reviewer would not buy this lmfao they would already know it39s made by apple so it39s over priced 😂😂😂 alvinamana1459 typical apple haterI39m sure you haven39t actually used an iPad for it39s intended purpose I still have an M1 iPad Pro and abolutely love it And I39m saying this as a PC user with RTX 3070 Ti powered system as well Just becasue you don39t see the purpose doesn39t mean it has no merit I would say that iPad is stagnating and Apple really needs to get the software to compete with Windows Mac and Linux in terms of power user tools But some things work far better on the iPad than any of my desktops Theres no way the ipad would replace a laptop same reason why no tablet ever will  if I am apple and I can sell you 2 different devices I am not going to make one of them obsolete and hurt my own bottom line grantschilb8019 Calm down fanboy alvinamana1459 if you have the money apple products are convenient enough since when they break you can just buy a new one but most people arent lucky enough to be in that situation for anything desktop related i still dont see the point of going mac though for the price of a mac studio you can get a PC that destroys it \\u200bgrantschilb8019so what is the intended use Power use Content consumption Those are covered by phones laptops foldable phones and PCs So what is that ipad can do better alihorda tbf tablets do it better than those things you mentioned However tablets can be a few hundred bucks 3k is wayyyy too much I spent 1500 on an ipad pro with a keyboard case and apple pencil and while it is very nice and I really like it if given the opportunity to buy it again for that price I wouldn39t I think 500 is a fair price for a tablet \\u200bgrantschilb8019 he is an Isheep and he proved it Made an entire video on the brand new Ipad which is 3600 fully maxed who has that kind of money I can buy a car which will last me for 10 years instead of this so why whats the point Again compared to Samsung S series Tablets the Ipad is too expensive slightly better and a trap to get into the Apple ecosystem It39s obviously 100 overpriced but Arun just goes on thinking that everyone has 3600 to spend on a Tablet and he doesn39t compare it to Samsung or the competition Many features were also stolen from the Samsung Tablet You know I39m not a Samsung guy but I find it amusing how many problems the Ipad has and how quotquotHonestquotquot Tech reviewers just ignore it \\u200bgrantschilb8019 its not hating on apple it39s just ipad for a regular user doesn39t make any sense and even if you want to draw make notes or do graphic related stuff an old ipad is still good enough you don39t need to spend this much to get latest ipad and by no means it can replace your laptop many software that are required for people for their jobs are not on ipad and for pro editing a PC is the best option you can get and even a macbook air m1 can do it but Arun making it seem like it is a replacement for laptop when it is not and if you want to spend less money and do just regular works that don39t require most powerful chips you can go for any cheap laptop Or he got paid good by Apple can you explain why he didn39t till now Or you an artist idk why people still left this fact up ipad also use for gaming you knows and people love gaming on phone heck people fucking lose their mind everytime gaming phone release ipad pro not only huge but powerful enough that people could probably not buy new one for decades But there’s people like me actually need to know the reason he provided before buying it😂I’ve been waiting for this for so long so pls don’t hate on him As a professional chemist and chemical engineer iPad is a essential tool I use daily for work and for fun My old iPad Pro was in use for 6 years and it still works great Paying 3000 for a device that I’ll use everyday for the next decade is more than worth it \\u200bisolatedtrader5482and when you realize that option c is actually option a 🗿 grantschilb8019 typical apple glazer Exactly I’m glad someone said it People like me won’t even look up the newest iPad because we know there’s no way we can afford something so frivolous and honestly pointless I bought into many of the same arguments when I tried to replace my laptop with an iPad Pro M2 and honestly unless you are very dedicated to adapting your workflow to the iPad it’s not as good of an experience as a Mac With the exception of drawing with the Pencil which is clearly superior on the iPad the Mac is more versatile and powerful The limitations of iPadOS are more significant than you might expect Those apps that look so optimized often lack features that the Mac version has and even if they have feature parity accomplishing tasks often takes extra steps brbrI’ll give an example I use Asana at work for project management In Asana you can tag other users by typing ““ and the first few letters of their name You then get a dropdown menu and on Mac you just use the arrow keys and hit enter to select the person you want On the iPad you have to use the touch interface to interact with the dropdown menu which means you start the interaction on the keyboard and then have to take your hands off the keyboard to use either the touchscreen directly or the mouse both of which are less efficient and intuitive That’s just one small example but there are a million little things like this that add up to a lot of frustration over time brbrThat’s before you even get into things like external monitors where iPad also has more limitations than Mac file management is more limited device integration is more limited You can’t use the amazing Universal Control feature without a Mac period Even though when Universal Control is activated you can use the iPad Magic Keyboard and mouse to control a Mac you can’t initiate Universal Control with only an iPad iPadOS is still treated like a junior OS which is mind boggling given the level of power the iPad pros have in them brbrI also don’t see the iPad Pro as a good replacement for the remarkable tablet It may be thinner and lighter but the price difference is massive and one of the benefits of the remarkable tablet is that you can focus on your writingdrawing with no distractions whereas the iPad is fully integrated into your Apple ecosystem and unless you go out of you way to shut off notifications and other connections you’ll frequently be pulled out of your focus state by intrusions brbrPersonally I think the 13” Air is a much better buy You get the same level of performance despite being two chip generations apart because iPadOS is so limited it can’t push the M1 to its full potential let alone the M2 you get a nice big screen that can work with the new Apple Pencil and you save a buttload of money Or buy a used M1 or M2 iPad Pro also save a buttload of money and still get the nice extra features like promotion displays etc Unless Apple announces a significant overhaul of iPadOS at WWDC that specifically takes advantage of the M4 chip there is very little reason to get a new iPad Pro for most people For creative professionals who do a mix of keyboard based work and pencil based work the new iPad pros are a much better value proposition but even then most of those professionals likely already have a MacBook and a drawing interface tamimatharemadi  He is a tech reviewer dummy tech reviewers do the extreme for review purpose Zack bends phones and torch their screen for a living who in their right mind in real life deliberately bend their phones and torch the screens after spending over a 1000 But I39m sure you watch those videos shuggfilmzandstudio2354 so tech reviewers do insane things for views I knew that it39s just that if he really wanted to honestly review a great tech product he should stop taking money from Apple and also mention the downsides which I don39t think he has in the entire video weird isn39t it If he really was a true tech reviewer and helped the public he wouldn39t have reviewed such an expensive device and not mention alternatives for his wider audience wow shocker guys a tech reviewer buys the latest tech im flabbergasted if you couldn39t tell Basically outoftouch with 99 of the consumers watching the review SyperLmaobut he’s the one acting like he didn’t know he would buy it Creature3010typical Android glazer I39m actually not an Apple fanboy I only own two apple computers a Mac Mini and the aforementioned iPad Pro And I own like 10 computers Everything else runs Linux Windows and Android All of them have optimized packages and or debloats But so many people make fun of apple products without taking into account every detail There are some things iPad do objectively better than even the most powerful PCs and servers If you don39t want to believe that then that is okay Just use what you like alihorda Form factor and DRM support Laptops may be the same size but they are locked to 720p1080p for DRM protected media iPad OS can play back full 4k How about touch pen support Windows tablets have terrible touch pens and one would have to separately get an expensive Wacom tablet Yeah phones can do most of the same things but form factor can be a real game changer Plus for people like me who prefer to keep social media off of my phone it can serve as a secondary device for using social media I39ve already shown that the iPad can be better than laptops phones and PCs in certain scenarios As for foldables that39s funny iPad has the advantage of not having a bending screen with a distracting crease At the end of the day it really is just what a particular user needs I personally like to see the positives of all things in technology Just like I39m probably gonna pick my laptop for running AAA games or emulators over the iPad boxlad7583 Exactly Some people just refuse to see the merit of iPad I39d never get the top spec one because it really isn39t practical for 99 of people The elitism of WindowsLinux and Android users gets on my nerves sometimes And I39m saying this as someone who prefers Android and uses Windows and Linux on a daily basis People should use the tech platforms they prefer Every platform has their ups and downs I just don39t care what platform people use anymore I39ve used them all and I39ve come to the conclusion that every platform is terrible just in different ways \\u200bgrantschilb8019 Maybe the Galaxy Books with the SPen can compete with iPad39s Pencil But Galaxy Books aren39t exactly the cheapest nor most powerful laptops there are I prefer a Samsung tab s9 ultra grantschilb8019 why can no one mention what these magical applications are that run better on iPad

ROAST most of the products even from big companies but when it comes to apple you become so soft and sweet guess why Always confuses me when YouTubers are talking about using Android phones as daily or as in this video saying “are they going to make me switch to iPhone” all the time wearing an Apple Watch  How do you have an Android daily while using an Apple Watch It just makes me feel dubious about everything you’re saying for that money I would buy a pcsystem with best hardware what is happening at your background something is moving Dude love the Apple watch background i tell you that i feel the oppositebrWhenever anything tells me to use their app i consider alternatives or dropping it completely if it doesn39t run autonomous if you can39t use it39s full potential offline it39s not a finished product i don39t want one thing relying on the other except electricity maybe I’m interested in upcoming iPad Mini and I see potential of making it even thinner and lighter than it is  with 2 gen 3nm chip and with similar OLED display you spend hours making this video appreciate the effort but didn39t see you complete the order in this video 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 13 inches is a bit too big for a tablet Those quotbig iPad Proquot memes may be making a comeback Hi guys pls like get to 2k like or I will stop studying It39s fascinating how someone can spin such a fairytale story about a boring tech bump This channel has become so untrustworthy Unsubscribed Then you get a 20 keyboard compatible with apple via bluetooth and it has rgb lights and all those top controls that the MAgic keyboard has works perfect In all sincerity why should you give 15x more I have a 5 keyboard works perfectly I want to buy an iPad and I have no idea what for I already have a Linux laptop and a Windows PC but the idea of an iPad seems so appealing for some reason Just get the base 349 iPad Not worth getting the Pros or even the air anthonyvallejo1537 Nah I don39t wanna cheap out to get outdated hardware Probably not even gonna get one but if I do I39m 100 getting a Pro a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a    😬 So I have a Mac at home and debated on purchasing an iPad Pro or or MacBook I went with the iPad Pro and now regret it It’s not a desktop websites think it’s a phone the M chip is not utilized fully there’s no way I can use it as a stand alone for business If I were to do it again I’d just buy one MacBook Pro and be done with it There’s no way this wasn’t an ad Does the new iPad Air support Final Cut 2 etc And as much your39s or MKBHD39s videos look real at the end of the day you are all paid by Wall Street anyway i would argue that if you are planning on spending 35 grand ur better off with a MacBook but for the casual to medium power users the base or slightly upgraded iPad pro makes a lot of sense i still wouldn39t think that a complete power user would be comfortable with only an ipad Arun is soo spoiled 8TB kinda guy😮 That39s what he needs for his workload and he bought it himself I39m in full agreement with most of the things you39ve stated here  more so in some areas that as a creator  you haven39t What I mean is that  as a music playlist creating  tablet gaming enthusiast  the idea of having my adapted setsets of gaming triggers and he39ll maybe even a fan now and then  being able to just break it all down and slap on such a keyboard  It39s sooo that I39m starting to analyse it39s coming probability and almost in the same vain as with quot loosing mac quot altogether brI switched to the Samsung s9 ultra some many months ago now  in the hope that preparation there would be worth while and I39m definitely optimistic about coming back  after the short break  The cost though and risk is high  Spends 5K in a macbook just to spend 35K in a tablet to replace it If I’m gonna be honest the new iPad is only just faster by a lot but if I’m gonna be honest I’d rather just buy the older versions It appears that you39re replacing a laptop with a

third of decade Arun definitely has not known about the Magic Keyboard for decades last like 4 years He was so impressed by the new one yet talking mostly about things that are not new 😂 😂😂😂😂 Perhaps the fact that they39ve eliminated better options cuz apple keyboard was always the worst yet the most expensive Once you notice it he does this a lot I don39t know if it39s in case the person watching doesn39t know about the products or to stretch the runtime But he does it a lot lirfrank i just think he didn’t know about it at all since he’s saying that he never stepped foot in the tabler world let alone iPads Damn 2018 iPad Pro here Works great and have ZERO NEED TO UPGRADE Until Mac os is on iPad im keeping my 2018 Finally i can watch youtube with high resulution Looks interesting it39s a pity its an apple product i use a surface pro for college Nah buddy I39m not a tablet guy considering it39s worth over 2000 I can buy a much faster PC for work Plus this tablet is more for entertainment than work So yeah maybe some rich dudes may buy it for entertainment but other than that I39m sure 90 of people won39t be buying it because of its pricebrbrPlus Arun I think you took too many retakes 😁 because the recording during the day turns into a recording at night Haha I had to double the brightness to watch it Doesn’t look like a review but “Promotion” Atleast MKBHD indicated few mistakes There is no BUTplease don39t generalise these amounts lol you could get a 4080 pc for the price of a 2tb model Me playing geometry dash Why still thick bezels and removed one camera silently and WiFi 6E 😅 THAT COST MORE THAN THE VISION PRO… WHAT Are you going to do a video about your new house when you39ll move  Somehow in my experience apps are usually so much more limited and less intuitive than websites U don’t need a MacBook or laptop but millions of developers testing professionals cloud engineers devops machine learning artificial intelligence complex designers simulation cell biology biomedical and much more day to day various computer technicians needed the most It’s just a powerful tablet for high end video conferencing fancy expensive video and photo designers content creators and Richie rich who doesn’t know where to spend money 😂😂 This was a useless video in the way that you could do that with the old iPads And this is nothing like a Mac with it

casual games ummm you are seated there about to spend that much money BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY TO SPEND I would love a part 2 after you’ve used it for a while U said 3600 for tablet u know that’s a bad deal Thank you for the review I have been using the ipad pro daily for some time now It is never a complete replacement for a laptop but it can easily replace about 7080 of the tasks The main limitation is the ipad operating system Multitasking is not great and extending the display is clunky It is however good for those who are easily distracted and need to focus on one task at a time Dude hasn39t used a iPad with a case or keyboard in 10 years lol You might want to check out Samsung39s tablet S9 ultra So it39s the same old pointless slab of glass with a FisherPrice operating system which you can do nothing with Oh and it39s even more expensive Shocker Lame This is a gross money grab from the fruit company STUPD AMOUNTS OF MONEY JUST STUPID 😖‼️🙄😬 Thats a no from me Regular guy doesnt need it As an Apple user yikes  that39s 3 grand manbrI love Apple devices and their EcoSystem but their prices are just ridiculous broooo if u are to use a Samsung Phone at least buy a Samsung Tablet better at everything and half the price I LOVE Android but even I have to admit I cannot see the appeal of an Android tablet over an iPad There39s so much wrong with that video I cant believe it comes from Mrwhosetheboss wow Perhaps instead of whining you could give constructive feedback This won39t do anything positive mrzeroskill Bro if I had the nerv to it I would have done it But since nobody cares about it I wont change many minds and I have better things to waist my time on live with that comment bluluke There39s nothing here about nerve Why are you leaving rude whining comments You39re just making false claims so you can have something else to whine about mrzeroskill 😂😂😂👍🏻 Ok i prefer MacBook pros but u do u   I ain39t spending 4k for the iPad and the keyboard just for it to do half the things my £800 laptop can do If you are not an artist of some sort or a developer of some sort then this iPad is nothing more than a waste of money If you are a gamer or would just use it for casual use it is a MASSIVE waste of money Why TF would spend 2000 or more for tablet Can’t use your old 300 Magic Keyboard and you can’t use your old Apple Pencil So much for a company trying to be carbon neutral And you don’t get the full capabilities of the M4 chip unless you get the higher storage What I have learned is that Apple robs its consumers blind Soo one time i was recording a video on my iphone 5 in 2023 and i taped it to my washer which fell into the spinning drum bBendingb it and surprised the thick glass didnt break I recently bought the sony wh1000xm5 headphones in the guide it said press the on button to automatically connect to my phone then once I put them on I haa audio guide which told me to go to an app which was SUPER easy to use even if you skip the instructions on how to set it up stoner purpinknI39m Aussie it39s illegal here but good response purpinknI39m Aussie it39s illegal here Me and the rest of the commoners in the comments are

ridiculous for most buyers We don39t want to encourage corporates to rip us off a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6001000a yep I quit dollar shave club a few years ago because they disabled

I watched live yesterday and I knew that you will test it Pretty much everything you talked about is so unimpressive it39s bonkers to me that you even considered paying that much for that thing  Why do you think apple products are so expensive Because people keep being simps and buying whatever garbage they39re peddling that weekbrbrInsert the quotI39ll take your entire stockquot meme galaxy S9 ultra gtgtgt Don39t b braindead spend your money on a Samsung tablet or Huawei or any other company I feel the opposite I much prefer when I can use a website not an app eg I used shazam on my phone I can’t then when on my laptop or pc see what songs I shazamed on their website I curate my playlists on a laptop or pc You can buy a discounted MacBook Air M1 and a iPad 10 for 1K and have a similar experience or better than on an iPad Pro…pure waste of money You bought to make a video about it lol the M1 iPad is already way over powered Apple losing their shit building a race car with rocket specs So did they finally release a product worth spending 3600 on how are games on ipad better than Mac if Mac already has all ipad games  ports of actual console and pc gamesbrbrbrbrbrso how is less games better “gaming utility”brnot even talking about how bad most mobile games are like how is diavlo 4 cod mobile and genshin better than all those games  actual good console and pc games Apple polishing cloth is thinnest of all apple products 😂 As it’s been said recently an iPad is still an iPad I can’t play steam games can’t open many programs in the same windowmore than 4 can’t make workspaces like the Mac can’t connect other devices moving you mouse between devices do I need to go on yes but for enough money you can get a laptop with a touchscreen and it39s better than an m4 tablet The iPad is most certainly not a laptop replacement lol This video feels like 16 mins of him justifying blowing his money on a new device lmfao but I don’t blame him I agree with this lol I wish iPadOS was less limited and companies made actual apps The port of DaVinci Resolve to iPad has every feature I don39t use and nothing else bro i was buy an ipad pro m1 when relesed  becouse think that it was be the perfect replacement of laptop drawing tablet and to be honest its uncomfortable to draw becouse ipad is small and you need to buy extra apple pencil and extentions for ergonomic drawing but ok not eweryone is an artist ewen to do simple thing like write emails without a keyboard is hard so you need to spend extra dollars for the keyboard So for real i dont know why ipad pro exist maybe just for showing what the company can do Its just expensive netflix streaming machine Better to buy Ipad AIRmini or the laptop Even iphone pro max have more sense then ipad pro \\rbrWaiting for iphone SE and mac mini m4 You can do offline Google docs At least in Chrome you can anyway M4 what is it a bmw bro recorded on morning to night Compare it to s10 ultra when we have one After watching the video its night time 😂😂brI39m off to bed 😂 Meh No point to this iPad other than showing you have too much money just one observation you can39t even have a visible bookmarks bar on your Google Chrome when you39re using an iPad iPad OS39 restrictions make it unusable as a MacOS replacement Don39t say I39m glazing I39m not glazing I don39t glaze for Apple The new apple pencil just came out It39s probably going to be a little buggy quotthe newest iPad is the thinnest apple devicequot I already have a 129” iPad Pro with Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard Case I placed an order for the new one and when I found out that I couldn’t use my existing Pencil and Magic Keyboard I cancelled the order Getting an OLED iPad only to add an antiglare coating completely ruins the advantages Blacks will be gray colors will be less punchy Basically you just ruin the screen When are they going to make the Apple pencil batteryless just like Samsung 😭 None of this is new from the current iPad Pro… Wow MKBHD and Mrwhosetheboss had completely different takes on this \\U0001fae8 Fr The iPad could feature a MacOS version when slapped on with the Magic Keyboard or connected to an

you crossed Apple in subscribers so when are you realeasing the phone He didn39t yet so close though That nano screen definitely eats up brightness and the deep blacks though I feel like they made it so thin because they want to emulate a laptop screen as much as possible One of the main issues with using the Magic Keyboard is how top heavy it is when in on a lap perhaps this design feature was

up and take my money … BOMBOCLAT I’ve bough an iPad pro in 2019 and I haven’t had the need for a laptop since I can do everything I need on it just easier and faster than on a laptop I understand is not for everyone but for 90 of population who doesn’t use it with an specific purpose is going to have a better screen better battery better speakers better performance and is going to last longer than an average laptop All they need to do is upgrade the software more capable in tablets and they39ll replace laptops very promptly Boss create a your MOBILE COLLECTION TOUR plz 🙏❤brAnd WATCHES etc  But the whole point of remarkable it to use it while being disconnected from unnecessary apps and notifications I think replacing it with the iPad would hinder your productivity apple people buy all anyway An iPad is a great machine but it will never replace a Mac because of iPadOS We had the same story since the M1 iPad The second i saw the metal keyboard from apple directly I realized they39re definitely killing the macbook air in the next 5yrdecade People in the comments be like people are buying iPad Pro in 2024 to watch movies without knowing millions of pro users use iPad for their work flow To be honest I made the switch in 2022 The Apple Pencil “pro” has a very little amount of change from the old one and same with keyboard I think you COULDVE done the change 3 years ago and it will feel almost the same as now Why only 1 camera now Thats why its lighter😅 I have spend years with all the ipad sizes best one is the mini I hope it gets a pro version brbr The 129 stay at home br Ipad mini LTE on the go br iphone mini go well with the mini lte Daaaamn No way I would ever spend that much on a glorified tablet when I could get a fully kitted out gaming laptop that does even more for under half the price  Also can you imagine breaking the ipad and how much it would cost for repair ouch Tip for PC users If you have the money Get a desktop PC and remote connect to it through AV1 decoding That39s looks like a heavy influence from Samsung tab s9 ultra and dex mode 😅 You could have bought a good second hand car for that money The m1 keyboard has many glitches as a user myself so this is probably a big mac like improvement I’ve been using the 2018 for a long time it’s still pretty fast I’m about to buy the new one too with the Max configuration I wouldn’t spend that kind of money just to play games on it but if you are into drawinganimationpainting it’s been the best product on the market for a long time I have a 1400 windows laptop that runs every game maxed except fallout 76 almost maxed screw you Todd apple can hop off a cliff Despite my best efforts I couldn39t replace my laptop with an iPad due to iOS limitations when compared to macOS In simpler terms iPads are like vitamins while laptops are like painkillers However IPad cannot replace laptop until MacOS is available on it I think Jerry could just rip this one in half let alone bend it lol I39m waiting

While it39s very good for taking notes via GoodNotes for media consuming for some photovideo editing whatsoeverwhat I39ve found is that as soon as you are in need of doing some serious project with multiple files opened and 2 screens iPad OS will haunt youYes it does some sort of multitasking but you must be able to enjoy punishing yourself doing that and your productivity will hardly match the one using a laptop Also having all at your disposal can be incredibly distracting some timeswhen you just want to be focused at something like receiving an email during a meetingbrIn the end I gave

annotated PDFs which  got corrupted by itself on this iPad I have not seen this problem with any other device and when I talked to iCare they told me please do not annotate PDFs because they do not have a solution for this and apparently few other users also have the same problem  Worst decision of buying iPad Air I do not recommend I39ll be waiting for your feedback on that If you change your MacBook for an Ipad I would love to know the results of it For me the main downside of a tablet is that it can not do what a full laptop does at leats not as easy If I had this money I would buy a really good gaming pc Apple fans can sell one kidney  and one  eye Love the vids If the screen was good we wouldn39t see reflections of everything in it while it was on full brightness What a bunch of copycats Sponsored by apple💀 Sounds interesting but as a longtime Mac 1992 iPad and Remarkable user good luck with the iPad battery life compared with Remarkable The former always seems to be short on battery when needed whereas the latter keeps going for a lot longer You have more money that sense Man the folks setting prices at Apple lately must just be twitching in a pile of cocaine and empty Red Bull cans  I couldn’t justify buying this at twice my income Watch it fold like paper when Jerryrigeverything does a durability test iPad does not require laptop space for working Of course you can try to use it as PC alternative option but you will have struggles For me I get rid of my Macbook Air because I didn39t use it as much as I thought I bought it because instead I would have to buy iPad  keyboard so it was obvious choice for me to go with Macbook Air I later realised that I didn39t need the keyboard for just scrolling and streaming It39s far easier for me to travel with just an iPad especially that you do not have to use dedicated charger and in Macbook you kinda have to It39s also easier to grab iPad and do something on it than grabbing Macbook Air even as thin as it is  I ended up waiting for this release and ordered base iPad Pro 256 GB and I think this will suit all of my needs I believe OLED is worth this price  we will see how about the burning in the end after few monthsyears but I do not care I used Tab S amoled and didn39t see any burning I still have it but it39s barely usable because of the garbage software I wish I can afford it and the amount of cost in Australia 5000 for it 3999 for 2TB Still thicker then a tab s9 ultra and a worse display Very good But why not an Ipad mini Pro Try using an app designed for iPhone on the iPad and tell me it’s

with a keyboard that39s a laptop replacement So a Microsoft Surface Yo Mrwhosetheboss wait until you discover ipad hubs too   Also if you are not playing games and using your pclaptop for mostly browsing and office stuff ipad with keyboard pencil combo is the one of the best But if you are not in the apple eco system and if you already have a xiaomi or samsung tablet with keyboardpencil combo again why should you spend over 3000  But not gonna lie i am using M1 chip ipad pro and even M1 is over kill for ipad and now they put M4 Super light which is very good but that tiny thickness may be a problem It looks too fragile And at last they put the front camera to the right place I liked this video Not as much because of the subject but mostly because you did not film parts in the vomit

many artist and creators don’t use a PC at all and are able to get by with a tablet just fine using a PC can actually be a bit of a work flow bottleneck Windows is not a very good touch interface OS As far as hardware goes it’s not even close The iPad’s have vastly better displays far more responsive and computer much lighter for the size and better battery There isn’t really and objectively best product it all comes down to use case and personal preference iPad pro m1 beat tab s9 ultra in performance 😂 rd3munna812accept in every other way 😂 applebrFbrAbrNbrBbrObrY alexaccount1 That’s very un objective the display is far far better as well The “professional apps” are also far more condom and optimized for iPad As much as I prefer samsung phones I39d assume a 4000 tablet will probably beat the samsung tablet U would hope so for that price I39m sure Samsung will take a stab at it too amp since quotnothing includedquot works like a charm for apple they39ll follow suit😢 Really getting sick of the greed following IDK I just hooked up a 50 14 inch screen to my Galaxy S24 whose performance is around an A16 so who cares All that matteres is you are spending 3000 or whatever for a computer that39s nerfed by iosipados whatever because Tim Apple won39t canabalize ipad sales by adding a touchscreen to a mac \\u200bquantuminfinity4260Samsungs display is better and idk what professional apps beeing more quotcondomquot is meant to mean but im not missing anything on my tab S9 not even procreate which I like a lot But there are awesome free alternatives for android aswell and they do give you basically the same experience just that you can use the SPen which is far better then the Apple pencil and prob better then the apple pencil pro havent had the chance to test one yet So yeah performance might be a little bit better on IPads but I never had to wait for anything in my time of usage yet and I dont think 99 of people need more performance then the S9 offers and if they do for editingrenderingwhatever then a laptoppc is usually better for those kind of tasks anyways Which leaves the Tab S9 as the Tablet with a better display a better free pencil lower costs same quality and higher quantity when it comes to apps and a much better software connectivity with all android devices  Windows awesome AI features more functions better UI and much more options for personalisation and ofc Samsung Dex \\u200bquantuminfinity4260 calculator  😂 wrenchin While I do agree it’s silly that they don’t have a first party one for anything beyond basic math you would just use spotlight for

pointing out that bhugeb pricetag For that  it outta cook my breakfast wash my laundry fold it too  The s9 Ultra and even s8 Ultra already had most of the important features this iPad has now and for a lot less money and more capabilities for productivity The only factor is the M4 chip that is completely overkill and I don39t think it will make any meaningful difference Jj82op The display is also vastly vastly better But there are also much cheaper iPads that are still far faster \\u200b\\u200bquantuminfinity4260 Both are OLED now the Ipad has a double OLED panel layer for more brightness The samsung is Dynamic AMOLED 2X which is a special OLED panel they make for devices with very accurate colors 120Hz and a few more details There might be a very slight difference if conpared side to sidebrThe M1 chip was also faster than the Snapdragon 8 gen2gen3 but that doesn39t mean it39s slow Even considering that Ihink they still have many specs that are worth it rd3munna812 with a 2000  difference I can buy a galazy tab and performance pc lol quantuminfinity4260 proper artists and creators dont use OLED for their work device as IPS is more colour accurate quantuminfinity4260 how are

best tablet on the planet and it costs less than a flagship smartphone and people still complain MWTB This iPad is going to replace my laptopbrMKBHD This iPad is still an iPad running iOS and not macOS if you think an ipad is just a big phone you clearly have no experience with lumafusion and procreate Rather than beating the bush arun just get a surface Completely different initial review than MKBHD You sound more like a fan body than him I don39t understand why people wet themselves with Apple overpriced products brAnyway I like your channel but when come to Apple I believe you are biasedbrKeep the good work Time for Zack JerryRigEverything to test the integrity of its structure  the bend test You mentioned your wedding when are you and Tim Apple getting married Apple money credited into youtubers account Yeah i still cant see the appel of an ipad other than bigger screen i mean the user experience is great but So is a Mac and an iPhonebroh but the pen yeah an good pc and a drawing table or just a drawing table is way betterbrBut i can see the appeal of a phone that is just very big if you like it you like itbrAlso i love S Pen but i feel like android just has not the plethora of apps there are on ipad os still an s pen is amazing on samsung tab s6 lite or better Man’s gonna release a video in 2 weeks detailing why he returned this in one word  an ipad isnt worth spending that much moneybuy a gaming pc instead and an android tablet What about abode apps It sounds like every single excuse that every single iPad user gives himself to buy one but this one it39s even more expensive Would the new base iPad work with thirdparty folio keyboards Untill you can fully use software like Logic Pro Photoshop Blender and so on iPad is just a smartphone with extra steps Something that is laying the house for everyone to use Me crack39s the screen on new iPad brApple and that will cost you arm and leg do you want to pay now or in pieces 39I always feel better when a product  asks me to install an app instead of a website39 Hard disagree Jesus the apps have gotten out of control can hardly use a public restroom without installing an app another app for payment and a third one for kyc This ipad price and disgn is make for the 001 of the real usersfor what i use a tablet is for youtube email and some easy  games400 dolar tablet do the job complety finelol If it has the function of a laptop thats the time the IPad will be reasonable to buy and oh my god Arun please don39t advocate buying iPads its genuinely not worth it for 99 of the people brever heard of a notebook and a pencil that and a laptop does everything an iPad would ever do brbrSpend that money on a desk setup You are about to buy because you seem to be addicted to tech and having things and justifying for why you need the new products and are even better than the ones you have this is something we all do  the difference is that you have built a business around that addiction My thoughts are that since all the iPads have security vulnerabilities where basically every iPad can be jailbroken apple thought lets upgrade the whole thing since they hate jailbreaking brI think tablets are just laptops for kids Everybody has a phone but kids want gaming and watching videos which tablets are the best for especially the iPads then why are you sitting there about to spend that much money on it brCOME ON NOWbrJUST because you39re have an extremely big youtube channelbrbecause you39re exrtemely rich and because it does well for your channel can39t wait for the postpurchase paranoia followup video 😂 This is going to start a new era of bendgate I literally got an ad of the iPad pro and thought it was part of the video lol a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6251025a I can assure you google docs is much worse on an ipad Can39t wait to see  it not survive  Jerry39s bend test Nah this is just way too OP 😬👀💀💀💀Good luck keeping that macbook Great video Tim39s WoooW is so hilarious Literally more powerful than my Mac lmfao What is a computer 3600 five years later you find it in a dumpster No offence but my expensive apple mac pro cost almost nothing now as no one no longer wants it Idk why ppl aren39l talking about this bris it just me or did apple just fit in buzzwords like AI ML just to quotkeep up with the times of techquot with the release of this iPad but mentioned no practical uses of this AI aside from a slight boost in performance which we would probably never even end up using brIMO if you want to enter the AI industry create some nice software alongside killer hardware There39s no point having an M4 iPad if you39re just going to be playing something like genshin impact on it I know he’s not an ipad guy but the apple pencil 2nd gen did already have a haptic button to switch pen tips There wasn’t nothing there Pocket change for you185 million subs Able to run YouTube videos at 4K 60FPS I would buy my bream setup with that much money 😶 This video feels like Arun trying to convince his finace why he needs an iPad that costs as much as a car XD It’s a masterpiece I better buy a bike or a used car thats just crazy and you are out of your mind to give apple that money for that thing Not talking about how the video started daylike and ended nightlike yea you don39t need to spend THAT much money on itbronly if you39re an artist  creator and you need to make use of those new apple pencil features you need to purchase it but other than that a 50 buck keyboard and the already existing magic mouse 2 are just fine Wish they didn’t make them too thin I mean if you can make them that thin maybe keep the same thickness and give us bigger battery iPad lasts a good while but a bigger battery is still welcome They should have made it out of titanium like the iphone 15 These iPads are just the same as the old ones only different is m4 chip and u should get a iPad Pro m2 instead of iPad Air 6 Beautiful device for kids to watch Diana and Roma I feel like an ideal event line up would be br1 WWDCNew SoCs and OSes announced here first before announcing devices that can take advantage of itbrbrAnd then the devices themselvesbrbr2 Maybe IPads first Cause they usually go with the standard version of M chips maybe throw in the MacBook Air and IMac in there as well for the same reasonbrbr3 iPhones AirPods Apple Watch whatever…brbr4 MacBook Pros Mac Studio Mac Pros Overpriced This just feels too much like an add He39s too excited about it As if this will actually replace a laptop It will 100 not except for my mum who just watches netflix and reads the digital newspaper who already uses a tablet anyway I still use an iPad 11inch from 2018 and get to do everything i want or need brInsane to think anyone will really needs to give Apple more money for gibberish stuffbrThere is a reason they don39t compare models consistently and explicitly It is because 80 of people out there DO NOT NEED IT cant wait for new video in few months iPad not what i thought because i bought ipad to replace my mac and do all the things you just said here but its just not cutting it now i just use it to listen to music and watch youtube Wow this first impression just kinda was a letdown Between the lines all i heard was quotHas Oled i want itquot The thing all the points also applies to either m1 air ipad pro 4th and 5th gen yet NOW is the right time to change from mac a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt209329a I think the next wwdc will be a big step in that direction especially since tim cook hyped it up I absolutely love your humor and love your channel ❤ If you couldn’t replace your Mac with the last version this doesn’t change anything Until they change the OS these hardware upgrades are somewhat pointless Apple just release dual OS option Mac OS when attached to keyboard iPad OS when not Make the iPad capable of running MacOS Then it would sell like hot cakes but fortunately kill the Mac at the same time With the USB port you can just use an external drive brbrI replaced my MacBook Pro 2014 with the iPad Pro M2 and I only have great things to say about it So its pretty much a notebook with less ports Booooringggg i cant wait to see the Jerry Rig Everything video of the IPad being broken in half i feel like apple is again in the time they tried to make everything as thin as they can and like on the iphone 6 thats gonna be a problem because in something like a backpack theres even more tension than in a pocket of your pants i definitely wouldnt buy it because i think its just gonna bend if not even broken in half at some point So it39s a bit better and way more expensive Microsoft Surface for mac users kinda overpriced and old keyboards and even 2nd gen apple pencils cant use ONLY APPLE CAN DO In 6 months why I sold my iPad m4 a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt502822a mrwhosetheboss did the apple thing D a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt176256a first thing I wanna point out is that you won’t worry about sitting on your ipad in your pocket my current ipad is always on a stand and I only remove it when I put it in a carrying bag and I’m definitely not sitting on that bag So apple is loosing people interest in laptops that they now have to reimagine or rewire people into new ways and reasons to buy ipad The apple pencil is now doing what surface pen is doing from past 11 years The iPad which is touch device doesn39t work good with the final cut pro 2 without keyboardlol quotMobile games are better designedquot that39s the point when I stopped listening D how about using a convertible laptop Even though they look great I just don39t see how it can replace my laptop I really dislike apps prefer the website for most stuff and hate touchscreen keyboards that specialized coating sounds good though could use that on my macbook I have the M1 iPad Pro 129 and honestly this iPad is NOTHING new I have the Logitech Smart Folio and that is practically the same as the new Smart Keyboard The biggest limitation of the iPad is the software and it’s still the same so no it won’t replace your MacBook you are just being brainwashed Yeah if you have a new enough iPad there is absolutely no point in upgrading Especially if you have a keyboard for it because the new ones don39t fit in classic apple fashion quotI always feel better when a  product tells me to use their app than when they direct me to a websitequot Never Cook Again Thin means breaks easily it39ll snap if you breathe on it wrong mark my words They actually said its just as strong brJerryrigeverything will probably show us But why are the bezels still so thick The iPad would be a perfect MacBook replacement except for software compatibility So many apps exclusive to MacOS are the reason people buy them I love your videos  I watch a lot of tech youtubers but i like the way you give honest and true info about a product Watching your videos makes me feeel like I am in a lecture class and i love that actually😊😊 I think it would be disappointing Apple39s iPads are in such position right now where they can be superior to MB or at least the lower end when it comes to performance Combine that with all the accessories faaar superior display touch screen and all of the superior mobile ecosystem that you mentioned and penvil support it suddenly makes the MBs obsolete But Apple won39t do that imo Now really brbrIts the OS that makes the difference Its not the same as macbook Aneliuse I never said it was the same Too much money Give it 2 years you can get it for 500 dollars What is the normal wrighter thing you were using Everytime I see Tim Crook it makes me laugh I keep thinking of a quothuman wishbonequot I mean just how bowlegged can one be  LMAO LMAO Don39t spend this stupid amount of money and do what I did Went out and got a 2nd Gen Ipad Pro for SUPER CHEAP which literally does everything I need it to for about one eighth the price of the new one Intel core i9 Apple knows they need to step it up because windows on snapdragon XX plusX elite is on its way this will be a big deal because yes snapdragon X soc will start on windows but it won39t be 6 months before Android and Linux runs on them too Thats why they just crushed the competition again Bro i goy an ipad pro ad while watching this I wouldn’t bother with the nano screen it scatters more light If they bring macOS to I pad and introduce some Autodesk apps I will switch But apple doesn39t want to For the average user it Still have not that much use over the m1 ipad realy Look I am a med student and I feel that the iPad is hands down the best device because I can use it for note taking  pdf annotations  social media  gaming and consuming content  not as a camera you weirdos😂 So I place the iPad on top of my apple products scale that39s my whole year worth of school fee💀💀 Samsung already did all that years ago It is definitely a mistake Soon you’ll know 😪 iPads are so much more casual to use than a MacBook The features of this apple pencil is similar to my old 2013 Samsung note 3 pencil😀 Lol this man39s going to be extremely disappointed if he expects a smart home just from Apple products Most of these reviews are biased You don39t really need this tab Just use your older tab or get an old M1 or M2 Tab or Samsung39s Tab 🤟🏻😌 Where to buy that grey Pullover I love my iPad Pro 129 that I got last year I’m legally blind and it is freeing for me as I can do so much that I cannot see on the phone However Thanks very much arun I now want this new one hahaha I’m probably lucky I can’t afford it as I’d be hovering over the buy button too a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt570930a  Thank you for realizing this Apple has stated this many times themselves I have a MacBook and an IPad Pro with cellular I am a professional video editor It is EXTREMELY rare that I use my Mac BTW it only costs an extra 10 a month to add the iPad as a cellular device and it was beyond worth it It has become a central hub while I’m working My iMessages mail and FaceTime all come to this as well It also allows me to pick up and work anywhere I love my 2022 edition keyboard and pencil and I am SO EXCITED to get these new ones Very rarely do I spend money on items for work and myself 😂 For a 1tb iPad Pro you pay 4500 AUD… more than a 4090…😂😂😂 Spend thousands on a tablet give it a keyboard May as well just get a macbook Still cant use statistic program for university whereas the mac has it for free even Samsung fan here 🙋\\u200d♂️brApple really did cook with this one the only downside is the price but that39s just apple being apple Well the m2 iPad also has center stage and it’s pretty dope for ft The thinner the iPads are the more uncomfortable to hold them I love my older 97 Pro iPad with its curved edges  use it as a book reader Using newer iPad pro is pain for longer time Can you make phone calls with that HELL NAW AM NOT BUYING APPLES NEW TABLET THAT ALMOST WORTH LIKE A APPLE VISION  FOR KIDSbrbrsamsung has better quality price stuff Finally an optimal way to watch cocomelon I can’t seem to find info on the normal new iPad I’ve heard that the iPad 2024 will be cheaper than the iPad 2022 but nobody seems to have a video about it Will be waiting for ur performance test on the aaa games on ipad like resident evil and death stranding to actually see where M439s GPU stands As a developer this would never replace my pc but you can now see more faces in a zoomteamswhatever meeting I swear everyone who insists that they need the m4 is either really well off and has the money to burn or could have done with an m1 air that costs less than half as much Yes it is a good aid but can not replace a laptop or PC Yes Simply YES Why CODM 😂😂 BRO WAS DEEP THROATING THAT TOOTH BRUSH WHAT THE The only problem I have with ipads are that they still run on ipados and not macos making it incompatible with a lot of important apps Arun don39t worry I still think every single pun of yours is funny When the magic keyboard first came out for the iPad Pro I immediately bought one  It was bthe absolute bestb keyboard I had ever typed on and that is having used macs for years and years at this point  It is absolutely the selling point of any iPad Pro and 1000 worth every penny it costs  But for me unfortunately I absolutely need the tools MacOS provides  It is the one limitation that has kept me from upgrading my 2018 11quot iPad Pro  Yes it is very nice to type on iPadOS has improved every year  But its just not there  They need the mac features for someone like me  Adding the function row on the new Magic Keyboard gives me hope Who would spend 5600 on a Ipad Apple subscribers 189M hmmbrMrWTB subscribers 185M hmmbrMKBHD subscribers 188M hmmbrbrWho39s gonna win My 2020 iPad Pro is my most used device The boss is Apple That is who the boss is The problem with tablets is if you want a very good Android tablet or iPad it is  going to cost a lot of money brI can remember getting a tablet for 230 Bucks it was crap inferior to my ZenFone 4 in performance it only had 1GB of ram and a weak CPU Why new products don’t provide new things Yearly releasing new stuff is stupid Keep old things doing for same Arun your light guy did a bad job at setting up the lights as the video went by he could have adjusted as the light was dimming outside or maybe you guys wanted to be symmetry with the outer light in the environment to that of the room39s set up Arun dont buy the matt display marque39s opinion I thought this same thing yesterday Can i Code an compile an Android Apo on an Ipad Should i buy macbook m3 pro or ipad pro m4 I have a computer i have a laptop i have a tablet i have a phone non of these can be replaced by the other Ask again in 15 to 20 years Imagine dropping a 3600 ipad on the floor 💀 whatever it is please change that retcehed wallpaper used in the ipad shown in the video It39s pure stupidity to pay more than 500 for a phone or tablet because they got much better value for money We all gonna wait for the bend test from zack anyway lol And you can39t even code on this why apple I think I39d prefer an Android foldable but I really love the new keyboard arun has gone off the rails saying the iPad in its current form could be a Macbook replacement it’s literally a nerfed Macbook If he thinks this can be a MacBook he should try running an IT business from just a iPad… GLHF with that… Apple just makes up an excuse for stupidity rich to spend money on and “bought” it  most influential people get it as a freebie or have amounts of cash laying around it doesn’t matter how much it costs I can afford buying one but for this amount of money I rather buy a MacBook Pro then an iPad in it’s current OS state It’s in no way comparable to macOS at its current design state and Apple never will do that because otherwise MacBooks would get an touch screen upgrade… they want customers to get both that’s why iPad OS doesn’t support multi profile users If you got 4 kids you better get 4 iPad littles and 2 airs or better… but for the birds and bees we won’t add stickers to the new iPads… Apple only cares about more money  not their customers He makes some really good points tho Ie most online services now have apps as their main portal I am definitely on the same boat where I prefer all my banking ecommerce internet and phone payment gateways etc are all done on an app as opposed to a website portal Some ecommerce companies give better incentivesdiscounts on their mobile apps than on their website I’m just waiting that those apps to run on macOS as well since all modern Macs are now running on ARM Mseries chips Then we’re back to square onebrbrIt’s definitely not a true 11 replacement yet but for Arun’s use cases he seemed to be convinced that it’s possible for him His use cases and ours aren’t the same But it’s probably true the future is definitely appbased and the iPad does that better than any Macs Guy is just lying to his audience It depends on your use case manbrIf for him it is a MacBook replacement than that means whatever he was doing on the macbook he can do on the iPad with little to no drawback It isn39t necessary a MacBook replacement for everyone neither is he implying that I feel like he dropped the ball on this one Sadly absolutely nothing had changed in terms of the software with this new iPad lineup Metal finish magic keyboard still loses to Macbook because the angle is still limited Even the M1 iPad can do so much but Is neutered at the software level and has been for a lot of years now I don39t see that changing either michaelcamello527 nah he did say “for my use” If it can be a MacBook replacement for his use then that’s good for him For me it’s almost a laptop replacement the only thing I miss on my iPad that I still use my laptop for is blender and league of legends For anything else I can choose between my iPad or laptop and there would be practically no difference The one and only thing holding the iPad back is… iPadOS 💀 Also some of the quotnew featuresquot of the new ipad pro have been available on the older ones for a fraction of the price Like the barrelroll of the pencil Or the squeezing when you could just double tab on the old one Additionally most of the new processing power of the m4 chip cant be accessed due to heat and software issues ConnorConntroller m4 is good because it has more performance per watt Thus less heat and faster performance before and after thermal throttle nicowasheremate This is the one thing holding back the iPad The tech alone is good enough but the software is what kills is Heck I would39ve replaced my Macbook a long time ago for engineering university if I could take my Calculus notes and program Software Engineering projects and manage the stuff like on my Macbook with the iPad It39s the perfect 2in1 in terms of hardware But on software It sucks ohnoe it does But If you faktor in the Space lost for heat transfer you simply cannot unlock this Performance Of course the full specs are Not out yet But you can see that in the comparison between the new iPad Prothe old m12 Chips and the Mac Book pro m3 Chips with the m12 comparison michaelcamello527 187M subscribers expects everyone to buy his spiel hook line amp sinker no questions asked fortimusprime Yeah Hopefully some announcment at WWDC could fix it horrorstorywp3gd I really hope this is the case I just want iPads to be useable for my case I wish it was perfect as a 2in1 ConnorConntroller they claim they39ve updated their cooling solution though We39ll have to see on release if that was just marketing fluff or if it was based on some truth quotThe blacks are so deepquotbrYea I got those quotDeep blacksquot in my 200 phone too Basically LED is off Amoled is cheap now anyone First of all nobody asked for a thinner tablet They may be asking for a lighter one but how light do you need them to be Second with a thinner body comes smaller battery and more thermal throttling Third anyone gonna mention the aspect ratio on this thing Last but not least I truly believe tablets one day will replace laptops but they will need a couple more ports and much better software integration I39m sorry but if it still runs ios and iOS apps it39s not a laptop replacement for any  significant use case I have an iPad and cringe whenever I hear people call it a PC replacement brbrAlso would like to remind people that initial quotreviewsquot aren39t reviews  Apple historically manipulates media availability to beneficial content So this is more of a marketing summarybrbrAlso trying to use my iPad on my lap like a laptop even with the magic keyboard is a joke along with the new iPad pricingbrbrSorry MWTB I know you gotta make that money You do you man Don’t convert to dollars This is England Apple should have called the three chips after the M1 the M11 M12 and M13  They haven39t actually created a new generation yet Bro you39re the reason why infinite amounts of people confuse quotwhosequot and quotwho isquot Why so dark  I felt lack of lighting in your video Was mildly interesting until I saw a double layered OLED lmfao If it is in any way close to DL LCD Sony use on their monitors or maybe better due to OLED this is prolly the best screen on the market lol The only thing we need to know is if it39s QDOLED for max color gamut I wouldn39t buy it even if I had won the Euromillions lottery thats a nice gaming pc price right there Still iPad is just over powered hardware limited by software Mrwhosetheboss is the GOAT Mrwhosetheboss videos are always better than MKBH it seems like he had so much more time to think about the product and contemplate on it before giving an opinion a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a ayooo bro 💀 You really took your time testing the iPad with that female staff 😏 Great video even though I dont even like apple products I just watched cause i enjoy your videos hahaha ❤❤❤ Most of the good things for the new iPads come from being better than the MacBooks So against laptops without OLED without touchscreen still in clamshell form and without a proper packet manager  Market segmentation and keeping features from consumers is making Apple billions bro why is your camera quality getting worse and dark 🔥 Mrwhosetheboss I think a lot of Apple clients feel exactly like you feel over the new Ipad Pro  You quotwantquot it  Now I too quotwant itquotbut I don39t need it  Your video had a lot of quotI want itquot but if you step back and ask yourself quotDo you need itquot  Nope you don39t  So save the money  for now  Wait for the M5  🙂 the most basic ipad pro is more expensive than my pc So we39re just gonna ignore how he was using that tooth brush 💀💀 he makes me regret buying my mac m2 air You bought it because it39s cents to you Stop it Laughs in fold phone  tablet It still uses iPad os if only it used Mac OS instead No matter how powerful it is  it is limited by its os Sounds like an infomercial to me Just get a laptop with touchscreen If you didnt notice Huawei launch Matepad Pro 132 half year ago which has capability to replace laptop Of course performance wise no as good as apple but they did it first Still iPad OS… brbrBring a stylish menu barbrDialog boxesbrThe actual finder from macOSbrA resizable dock that’s scrollablebrFull Microsoft office MicrosoftbrSmaller UI Elements it’s ridiculous brA normal mousebrProper windowing systembrA desktop or just something better with icons closer together brbrUntil then not wasting my moneybrWill stick with MacBook Seems this will appeal to a very niche market I imagine schoolcollegeuniversity students and businesses are the biggest market for laptops  they will all want the traditional set up I expected at least one more usb port One on each side would be nice I found your channel recently I have to tell you that yours has quickly become my favorite channel Keep up the good work I feel like apple want you to have a iPhone a ipad and a MacBook because switching to a tablet at least with Apple feels purposely hamstrung because they want you to buy a MacBook as well a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt9441544a 1000£ extra for 1744 extra Tb 😂😂😂 Apple must be smoking something when 2Tb top tier gen4 SSD are like 150£ Unfortunately since they run iPadOS what is the point They don39t do anything that the iPad Pros of 7 years ago didn39t do At least not right now they are gaining AI features in iPadOS 18 if feature parity between iPadOS and iOS continues If rumours are true the A series iPads won39t get iPadOS 18 The Pencil gained new features but that39s the pencil gaining features The keyboard gained new stuff but that39s the keyboard that gains the new features Plus if you39re adding a keyboard you now just have a severely limited laptop When you39re an Apple simp it39s not that hard to figure out I still don39t see this replacing my surface go Windows is simply so much more versatile nevermind having a micro sd slot for storage extension and not beeing locked into the Apple ecosystem Hey Arun I just have one thing to say after seeing this review of yours quotPeople should stop watching Apple product reviews online totallyquot You being a tech reviewer who has the access to basically all the new tech pricey or not should have the moral duty to clearly say quotbad is badquot specially given your videos are made for the people and not for the companies like Apple\\rbrThere have been other youtubers whom I unsubscribed just because they couldn39t say one negative thing about Apple just so that Apple invites them to their launch event and they can have these early access videos\\rbrLike right now you don39t know the exact M4 specs said the exact same stuff as their launch video which weirdly compares it to M2 and even M1 quotnot to M3quot yet you seem to be totally fine with it Why aren39t you even talking about things like thinner body means smaller battery they had the chance to double the battery life with this ipad and costly new pro pencil\\rbrThese quotconsumer harmingquot tactics then seeps to other brands and they too start the trend like the removal of charger super pricy accessories and the quotthisworksbetterwithourotherdevicequot tradeoff\\rbrWhy cant you be like quotTHIS IS WRONGquot Why do you always want to put Apple reviews in a very optimistic way no matter how crazy they are with the decisions about such new tech Please do not loose yourself on moral grounds as being a content creator try to be humanly helpful to the people the very people whose views are youtubers bread and butter Otherwise there is no difference between such review videos and Apple removing chargers from phones calling it quotenvironmental friendlyquot fr like it39s a great product but it39s worth 600 dollars at most not half of 6000 I think this is because he only used it in the apple event where he can39t test properly or this is a embargo date and the only topics he is allowed to mention are ones Apple has chosen so most likely are positive He said he will do a full review later and that might be more critical TheJediPenguin you can check his previous Apple product reviews They all be like Arun finds a way to somehow call it so game changing and always optimistic about even the cons of itbrAnd btw check MKBHD video on the same he literally called it pointless to have such an iPad no buttering of words or optimistic approach to not hurt Apple PFnove yes brother See how Arun quotcleverlyquot pointed out how this new ipad is an alternate to his Macbook  remarkable tablet in many scenarios But he forgets what he has bought remarkable for only remarkable can do that And the ipads at the time when he bought remarkable would offer the same functionality as the current ipads from his usage perspective Nobody mentioned but that39s next level No since we already are next level this is next next levelbrbrbr😁brbrmrwhosetheboss thank you for your thoughtful review You catch my interest although I39m not interested at all into a 3000 losable device Soon they will make a new division of there business Apple inc and Apple inc pro I always think that Apple products are too expensive and give you two little features for the price but this new iPad might be the first Apple device to change that If you get an iPhone you can hotspot without turning hotspot on for easy WiFi access So the iPad is worth it if you want to replace your notebook for 3600brGot it You bought it because you got money for saying this He didn39t mention that the keyboard is sold separately At that point another 100 around price I would rather buy a MacBook than that I mean I get having a iPad with this much capable but as a pc guy I feel it’s locked down setup is not that great Even though it has a desktop chip it can’t run desktop apps I understand the appeal but not for me Great vid I39d already choose to just go to a website then have to install a new app Horrible thing that39s become the norm In as much as this is an impressive device I don39t think this will replace laptops Most of the use cases you mentioned are majorly issues that the iPad solves for just not the majority of people Also the device is pretty expensive I do wonder sometimes exactly what planet Apple are on Who is the target market for a 4 grand tablet Who39s buying this And why do you hate your money sure replace your laptop with a giant screen that has even more limited software than the laptop Crazy waste of money brbrLike for real what apps are you going to use outside of the apple apps preinstalled I’m curious to what the battery is going to be like With a dual OLED screen powerful laptop grade chip with dedicated hardware just to run the display and in a thinner chassisI also noticed they never mentioned it once in the keynote quotYou can now squeeze the pencil to bring up the menuquotSamsung is laughing Nothing has changed in the iPad v last iPad You sound like a kid impressionable by fluf marketing language Folks go watch MKBHD it39s merely spec bump and actually worse cameras I also don39t see how Arun is really using s24 ultra as he gets full on aroused with every apple PR event Never thought he39d become the 1 apple fanboy Somehow this video gave me an unreal MKBHDVibe lol Good luck with that Tried it with an M1 iPad and it was a big fail I don39t see anything different here I bit thinner and a slightly better screen What it really needs is MacOS and a lot more RAM As an M1 ipad user I can say that the biggest downside is the OS Where are my adobe aps apple Stage manager isn’t really my thing also I would like to be exactly like macOS I want the IPAD TO RUN MACOS Not this ipadOS thing It is really close for me to switch from my bulky windows laptop but the OS is absolute garbage Great tablet evolution apple made this one great Can this iPad support multiple users… No Please may I have an M3 MacBook Air Didn39t you buy it to make a video about it 😉 3600 is absolutely ludicrous I know people are still going to buy it though Only 400k more people This is what happens when you have so much money you don39t know what to do with it If you’re getting rid of your MacBook I’ll happily take it haha quotThe World39s Biggest Hypocritequot 😂😂😂😂😂 Where is the benefit of changing the devices thiskness in the range of fractions of a millimeter in the end it doesn´t matter if it´s 62 or 53 mm thin But you´d need a new case because the old one just doesn´t fit perfectly anymore EARLY ZZZ COPY ON THE IPAD I SAW IT a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt349549a  the game is suposted to have a worldwide release in july and yet there it is on the ipad That is going to be 287700GBP disappointment I am afraid aaaaaah no thanx The bendgate flashback is crazy older ipads had most of the capabilities that you were highlighting pls reveal pixel 8a quotThat39s an obscene amount to pay for a tableBUTquot It says a lot about what Apple thinks about it39s customers when they are confident that they are gullible enough to pay for a tablet what they would pay for a motorbike or used car Plus the keyboard and pencil to actually make it useful NINJA KAMUI MASK DESIGN Louis Rossman watching this is thinking of the repair nightmare this probably is All the inconveniences under the hood The display is made by SAMSUNG😂 Zero interest I got an ipad pro once Still the 43 screen ratio which leaves you while watching movies with tremendeous big letterboxes and a remaining movie screen at the size of the iphone pro max If I want a great content tab I use my Samsung tab s9 ultra which has also a oled screen and a great 1610 ratio For work I use a Mac anyway DONT DO IT imagine just seeing a video with a full view from evening t sunset just tell me why would i need ipadtablet if i already have a smartphone and a laptop brbractually  i have macbook pro and 2 android phones yes i m a weird 2 phone guy also i got one tablet xiomi pad 4 but I do not use to much other than media consumption and smart home device controls Nice Apple commercial Arun is slowly but surely becoming a full on apple guy From the iPhone to never being a watch guy to now using an Apple watch to now an iPad lol I love how when ppl say this when they see someone using an Apple product for a brief time while 99 of the content is just the opposite He uses the S24U more tho but I get what you mean ecosystem lock in it is Apple makes each product the best to fit in their specific ecosystembronce you start it will just feel better To buy another apple product to get that integration That’s how Apple converted me One product at a time😅 Because they make good products I mean he literally uses a Samsung Ultra he39s only buying them 39cause he has some money Apple is a status like a Dior handbag filip9564 quotwhich only work better with their own productsquotbrquotOr else it would be very inconvenient to have both ecosystems and since apple works better with applequot He uses the S24 Ultra what are you talking about Mrwhosetheboss so you started the video in the morning and ended in the night 😝 Exactly I also bought a top end Tablet in 2020 All I ended up with watching Netflix and YouTube in my bed and during travelling I didnt even use it for writing email Cool 😮 Why do you spit when saying three Thuurreee not worth it until u can run macos app directly on it You could buy the best pc money can buy and it wouldn39t come close that price 🤦 Forget the apps What you are trying to say is that Macs dont have touch screens As an Apple fanboy I hope this current apple led by tim cook just failsbrGone are the days of the ambitious Steve Jobs Real Steve Jobs would be ashamed of Apple today depute the company being so big these days NoshikiYT yeah it looks like tim cook is an excellent profit maximizer but shit innovator sadly thats probably the first video that Arun is lighten by physical light which as the video progress it gets darker and darker and you can understand how much time it takes only to film it Apple should just take all the tech from the iPad Pro M4 and slap it into a redesign super thin and light 13quot and 15quot MacBook Air quotultra lightquot line With oled displays too Think old MacBook 12 thinness but in a package that actually performs and has a few more ports The new iPad Pro M4 show it can no be done in a thin fan less envelope so why not a real quotairquot laptop as well Let39s be honest This device only makes sense for artists Digital illustrators photographers videographers etc and rich college students Im waiting for you to be disappointed Windows have Netflix app with download option I was surprised finding out Mac don’t have one a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt456736abrI don39t think Apple will allow the iPad to have 100 software functionality and support of the Mac regardless of how powerful the M4 chip in the iPad is This is because they will likely want you to buy both the iPad and the Mac and offering full compatibility might cannibalize Mac sales There is already iMac which is basically a big iPad with a keyboard If there39s a quotguessquot of greedy option then Apple will do it 100 \\u200bproudbacteria1373 Its weaker and not portable totally different market Much like why Macbooks are not getting touchscreens It’s a shame because that didn’t used to be Apples mentality When they launched the iPhone they knew it would cannibalize the iPods but did it because they knew it was innovation and would suit them better in the long run brbrWhy can’t Apple make a MaciPad combo Basically make the Mac Screen an iPad then have the keyboard attach at the bottom with all the extra chips for added power When you attach the tablet part it becomes “MacMode” then when you detach it goes to “iPad Mode”brbrHonestly that would be an incredible device if they could pull it off and Apple should be able too with all their in house chips Don39t NEVER buy a shitty Apple product 😢😮 Exactly drewmorrison  I want to live in the timeline where Jobs is at the pinnacle of health and still alive today leading Apple because they wwant more moneeeyyyy didiervandendaele4036hilarious double negatives are hilarious proudbacteria1373no its not You think this but in truth Apple would love to hold the market in each area all on one device Imagine an iPad that turns into a Mac computer and can also be used as an Apple TV They have been doing this for ages now But if you are a wise buyer you know even the previous ipads are already capable enough to handle anything on the app store Just think about your lifestyle if you really need those overpriced tech Or you will just end up not using them most of the time ILoveGrilledCheese let39s wait and see ILoveGrilledCheese\\xa0 I don39t think apple want their ecosystem to revolve around the Ipad paisleepunk of course it was not never my goal 😉 This is exactly my take on this whole situation What Apple wants from the ipad pro is people like Arun saying quoti need thisquot and for bonus points quotit will replace all of these other nonapple productsquot What Apple doesnt want from the ipad pro is people like Arun saying quotnow i dont need this other very expensive apple product I ownquot Depending on how many people say the latter I predict the next iteration will be nerfed even further Ravp90\\xa0 hence they39ll make sure you have a reason to buy the ipad and the mac My suspicion is that the App Store revenue is so great that Apple will eventually ban all third party software from being installed on Macs what do you think the iPhone did to the iPod touch the iPod made apple one of the wealthiest companies on the planet and they OWNED the portable digital music industry robertobokarev439explain the ipod drewmorrison Oh trust me they probably can and have tested it They just won39t This is not absolutely correct but also not wrong This is happening because of Android and MS and not Apple Apple is ahead of competition mainly due to Android offering fast depreciation not enough support On the other hand surface is a weak machine with bad battery When competition wakes up Apple will offer unification Until then apple offers best value even by buying two devices iPad MacBook Totally disagree The iPad and Mac are fundamentally very different The iPad is designed from the ground up as a touch screen device and the Mac is not If the iPad functioned exactly like a Mac that would be called a laptop You can go buy one right now if you want mikemccormick6128\\xa0 Totally disagree with me or with Arun Because I39m not in support of what he said either Listen to what he said Watch from a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt456736a By the way the ipad and the Mac have the same cpu so they might as well have the same software compatibility Form factor or product design is irrelevant and shouldn39t be what determines what an ipad and a Mac should do You can39t put an M4 chip in an ipad just to watch Netflix then put an M3 in a Mac for some serious computing jobs That39s crazy  The ipad comes with a stateoftheart keyboard which makes it good for productivity like the Mac Why would someone buy a 3k ipad when it can39t do the work of a laptop a macbook air with a touchscreen and 360degree foldability would be rad ngl That’s why they don’t have touchscreen laptops lyon1556 Very few people will be spending over 3000 for the iPad I39m not sure actually how he got to 3600 I just spec39d everything out and it only came to 2600 and with the Apple Pencil and magic Keyboard it was a little over 3000 I spent about 1800 including tax the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard about 1300 if you subtract my tradein If I decide to upgrade again I imagine that I wouldn39t have to upgrade the Magic Keyboard or Apple Pencil This could possibly be my last iPad though if I can replace the iPad with the Apple Vision Pro I39m still debating thatbrbrObviously they will be putting the M4 in the MacBooks later on in the year Maybe they needed the M4 for the Tandem OLED They must have needed the M4 for some good reason In my opinion the Tandem OLED is a waste of money The current LCD screen with MicroLED backlighting looks amazing There is absolutely nothing to complain aboutbrI don39t really agree with you about having the iPad run macOS The iPad works better as a touch screen and the MacBook works better as a nontouch screen They are just two completely different devices that serve different purposes didiervandendaele4036none of their products are bad … drewmorrisonyou can see people all over the internet wanting to replace their Mac with iPad Giving iPad the functionality of macbook will cause apple a significant loss in MacBook sales while the people why buy an iPad will be buying that iPad regardless so it’s a loss for apple That’s the reason why they won’t do it Ever head of UTM I believe you have nailed the reasoning for apple All I want is iPadOS in the next update to reimagine itself for the M series iPads to introduce a Samsung Dex style interface Then I’m sold but Dex and the universal back button is holding me back from switching yeah a tab can hardly replace a laptop iPad Pro gt MacBook Air for most usersbrPS I bought a pencil off Amazon for £23 Works fine too much power for something useless get a mac guys That Nano coating defeats the purpose of OLED Can39t wait for Jerryrigeverithing durability test Wow Nice paid review samsung pen i much better Paying three grand for a completely locked down device you barely even own and can39t repair or upgrade and then pay taxes for on every purchase and when you run out of storage is the most Apple thing I39ve ever heard I39d rather go back to the terminal I still live and work IRL so not applicable for me 😮 I play games on iPad but over two thousand dollars on a iPad with closed eyes I would choose pc over iPad it is ridiculous They are still big phones Try doing some normal file operations in the Files app iPad OS falls apart very quickly Best screen they39ve made for a device Xiaomi stacked two OLED39s first and that was last gen  well done to them though😂😂 3 words Arun Network Attached Storage Youtubers pretending for 1000th time that a tablet

Thinkpad X390 from 5 years ago Thank you I don’t think you had bad intentions with this comment but in what way is your comment relevant or useful for this discussion The thinkpad X390 is a fine device What are you on about 0w3nn Probably because it has soldered ram Cappyey So Macbook also has soldered ram 0w3nn I’m not saying mac is better I’m saying he probably doesn’t like the soldered rambrbrSoldered ram should be illegal or at least laptops should be able to use soldered and unsoldered ram at the same time if the company really cares about ram speeds Cappyey agreed Please Mrwhosetheboss please I need on I am begging you Tech reviewers are so out of touch with the ordinary oublic nowadays you cant trust their oppinion annymore It39s an odd product I found them to be  unwieldy strangely heavy if you39re holding them for an extended period of time  Typing is ass  I can go on   It really is  just for video watching Except the OS still holds it back Apple indirectly

on the new ipad pro39s I just bought a lte m1 ipad pro logitech combo touch apple pencil2 for €650 and then discovered there were new ipads coming out and felt so stupid but after watching the event

too heavy for longer use If you need to buy separate keyboardtouchpad to really get most out of the ipad or to make it usable then you might as well buy macbook And because ipados limitations and lack

with a small remote I was disappointed that it wasn’t controllable from an app on my phone I’d much rather have an app You’re way more brainwashed than I expected 😂 I think apple made a mistake by releasing the m1 m2 m3 etc too quickly Apple used to have a decent resale value when it was the 2015 2012 etc now i think the39ve tanked the resale on the older m2 macs and could potentially put the

watching device I used to like Apple when I was younger but for the past 5 years they just seem to test the limits of how much their cult like fanbase are willing to over pay for anything with an Apple sticker slapped onto it Shameless scam from one of the greediest companies out there if you ask me I wait for the day they fly too close to the sun and fall off harder than Blackberry did altho I don39t see that happening any time soon unfortunately I use my ipad as a daily driver as a student I have had the ipad pro m1 128 gigs with keyboard and pencil for so long now might as well buy a Macbook Pro 😂 Well since you don39t need your Mac I39ll take it off your hands lol You talk about being able to use your tablet without touching the screen isn39t that the whole point of a tablet or one of the major points Why not just get a laptop at that point Speaking as someone who uses an iPad everyday at home as a sort of combination bookvideo splitscreen player and LOVES the handoff feature so I can keep reading on my phone as I leave the house and transfer right back when I get home yes You will have to buy an iPhone Sorry Arun where did you get your chair You need a laptop for video editing we need a laptop for coding we are not the same brobrbrAs powerful as it is in terms of numbers for most people it39s just an overpowered Netflix machine Obviously it39s a laptop replacement that would make sense for you because your use case for a laptop is primarily video editing but for most people it39s still far from being able to accomplish work related tasks whether it39s because of architectural limitations and OS limitations brbrNow a cool concept would be a hybrid between iPadOS and MacOS like how Windows 839s quottouch modequot worked allowing you to switch on the go Far too uncritical It39s obvious that the iPad is basically useless for anyone who doesn39t draw with the Apple Pencil iPadOS is the biggest limitation and makes the device almost useless and completely overpriced Google docs on ipad is still bad tho For some reason commands for adding footnotes do not work along with some other things and that39s a big issue for people who are deep into word processing like lawyers etc still no native calculator app why An ipad is not a macbook ipadOS sucks for productivity period The thermal throttling will be crazy 🥵 ⭐️⭐️ They should make a Smart Folio for the iPad Pro 13 inch like it’s with the 10th generation since I got the logi combo touch and it’s nice but I just want apple to make it for better quality and I hope they make it… Os is still ipad OS though Why would I buy this instead of a full fledged MacBook with a better OS I would say the iPad Pro is totally worth it for the specs you don39t need at least for 999 of the buyers I39d imagine it39s good only for artists and people who require to do video shooting and editing on the go Obviously for techies and people who has money to spend to experience the latest and greatest as there is a difference in experience in screen and pencil tech If I was 15 years younger I39d get one just for the tech as well But today I39ve become an average user with average needs A MacBook Air  iPad mini has become the perfect combo for me I39m still using the iPad mini 5 btw and still great for media consumption no gaming You can buy a  gaming laptop with crazy on that price btw which I think would be better Nothing beats that Samsung S24 Ultra IPad is the best Mrwhosetheboss i hope u take a look at samsung tabs because what apple does wrong samsung does good for example Spen housing is much better solved could be interesting video You get into ipad initially thinking it is freeing Most people do After the honeymoon you can see the frustrations building You will start missing the versatility and stability offered mac or pc The lack of solid external drive support really made me disappointed And your life become hanging and juggling through docks and adapters🙄 Mrwhosetheboss are you okay man you look kinda sad 😕 Until ipad can run Mac OS I won39t ever buy a new one Using my ipad pro to do anything serious is infuriating I prefer Android to iOS so why the hell do I need a giant BS iphone 😂 I actually loved the scene in this video Great work guys The fact that you cant have more than 1 instance of an app is a deal breaker for me And power point sucks screenshot to your clipboard doesnt exist Just so very inflexible to use I really don39t understand why you39d pay that much money when you can just buy a more powerful PC with a removable screen Apple fanboys are starting to be like christians They hate everyone and everything that39s not stamped by ApplebrPeople can like both And each has it39s pros and cons I cannot wait for this review My main questions about Apple products remainsbrWhy so much money on a tablet when a surface is way cheaper even with a keyboard and a pen And you are always forced to buy their expensive products And yes even the surface pro is too expensive considering the what the top phones do There the same no one is buying apple products alone for a useless oled panel tablet that should have been years ago like come on now I would love to see the iPad tested with GoodnotesbrI use a 2021 standard iPad with Goodnotes for school and I am very happy except the size because I have to zoom in to be able to handwrite… I need a new iPad maybe it’s time to bite the bullet In Australia here Arunjust specced one out to the max with pencil and keyboard 5277 AU bro please gift me a ipad😭 Dude what u do is just basic just buy it or use some outdated ipad it will work for your use case Man didn39t just sneak his wedding announcement in😊😊😊 There’s only thing I’m drawing with an Apple Pencil Please don39t expect me to have sympathy for you being able to afford this tablet There are still PDF files that can only be edited with a Mac and not on an iPad Even with Adobe Premium It’s frustrating especially when I don’t have a laptop with me and only an iPad Is there a work around to this that Google hasn’t been revealing to me Until legacy computing is obsolete which will happen eventually These ARM devices can never replace PCs and Macs Macs have their own problems now that they39re exclusively running on ARM iPads are still in a losing battle because they39re now needlessly using an inferior OS for no reason other than to keep both Macs and iPads alive Can certain people use an iPad for everything Sure but there will ALWAYS be that one thing you do that won39t work on the iPad or a different tablet I39m not even talking about things like gaming here or niche stuff like server management For an example look at browser extensions If you39re going to be using a tablet like a laptop odds are you39re going to be using the browser sometimes You probably have extensions you rely on On Android there are janky third party solutions to get those extensions but not on the default Chrome browser Assuming Apple doesn39t even touch the word quotjankyquot there39s probably nothing like it for iPad OS Lots of things you can’t do on an iPad yet I run lasers so no Lightburn no Silhouette no Google Chrome extensions just to name a few Basically most of the things I do on my Macbook aren’t even some version of an option on iPad a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt451731a samsung should

same with the app vs website thing I’ve stopped shopping at so many sites because they have ditched the app Who who are can39t effort but still watching 😂 its an amazing device if you just getting the

watching Severence 10 more than on the old ipad pro and up to 30 more than the m1 macbook air This may end up in a kids hand for youtube netflix or games So expensive for a kids toy I got an ad for it 😂 Another apple ad for overprice sjt that Samsung has been doing for years with galaxy  s tab since 1800 To expensive still just a large phone Stick to the MacBook Air iPad is very far from the MacBook I have the two39s but for productive and fast tasks the MacBook is very far from the iPad I don39t know why I watch these tech vids and I even don39t have these cool gadgets and not planning to buy This amount can get me a midrange studio 😢 would rather pay 3000 for ipad or 1000 for 2 and 1 and 2000 on sick set up this price point being soo high makes no sense and this is only reason why

nonupgradable slab that will be ewaste in 36 months time after you39ve bought 36 replacement pens Apple will release this then push huge OS upgrades later on that will render this slab useless and open to security vulnerabilities and then blame you the purchaser of the slab for causing ewaste and contributing to the climate issue 3000 bucks to play app games that is a bit expensive isn39t it  Its really shocking how they always finds a way to disappoint the audience and users Please do a review on this M2 iPad Pro 129 user here have seen absolutely nothing that suggests this is worth upgrading 😐 Arun apple glaze gotta stop man Wait until you start using the iPad for signing PDFs and reading documents Also the HDR for knocking together thumbnails is a game changer and the video experience is amazing Because you have money and we don39t When the tablet is more expensive than my RTX 4070 gaming PC 💀💀🙏🙏 Absolutely nothing in this video convinced me that anyone should be spending that much money on what seems to be half a laptop What spec did you go for in the end Still unsure about the nano texture glass Not the thinnest Apple product Forgot Apple cloth 😂 DO NOT FORGET AC ADAPTOR IT IS NOT INCLUDED 😂 That toothbrush clip though😂 The most ridiculous thing is that a power adapter is not included in EU and UK versions The greediest company ever Bro is still trying to overtake apple without noticing he39s about to overtake mkbhd YOU JUST BOUGHT IT CAUSE YOU HAVE MONEY TO WASTE With still shit called iOS it will never replace MacBook because MacOS and accommodating software is light years ahead for productivity then anything on iOS Anybody saying different does not work for living with computers period a few video editing apps do not countbrIf Apple would add opinion to add MacOS to M series iPad Pro39s which would be 2 months work for them now that SoC39s are the same then you have world39s first proper computertablet combo Arun39s videos

Then I39ll consider buying it I like Samsung39s Dex on their tablets and it  kinda works but it39s not there yet That39s what I39m waiting on Apple to provide if they ever will  Now it39s feels like

connect to the NAS remotely As for the file system that’s the main reason I have to use a real Mac I need access to the command line interface via terminal for remote server administration and the ability to ssh into network infrastructure firewalls routers switches etc brbrI’m super impressed with what Apple put together for his new release but wish they would finally let us use the fullon

real OS that can do more that watching youtube and do all the iPad stuff at the same time Less battery life yeah but what use is more battery life on an oversized iPhone And yes you can do all of those android apps thanks to the magic of VMs Honestly even if it is POSSIBLE to replace a laptop just with its raw specs and usability it39s not enough to justify the price point A tablet for 3000 pounds or 4000 USD if you include the accessories That HAS to be a fking workstation  gaming rig replacement if you want to justify that price point Like seriously with some good deals I could build a damn good desktop with that money and still have leftover money to get a decent laptop enough for any ontogo work I might need to do 🤣🤣 Maybe even throw in budget tablet just for watching Youtube or playing some light games which I am more likely to be doing on my tablet anyway than editing 4k videos or something Isn39t it better value just to get the mac air at that price Hi Arun Have you ever tryed Linux I don39t think you would like it but it would make for an interesting video Y don39t they just make a Mac touch screen and add bit functionality I39m 45 years old and even I consider Apple products to be products for the boomers It39s oversimplified garbage and you bought one because you39re a boyfan it39s like a Ferrari that can reach 350 kmh put you will only go 120 kmh ever Its so thin it can cut off your finger😂 Pun pun pun puuuun 🤡 a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt594954a except some software is 10x worse on iPad Very specific apps that 95 people not gonna

tried this iPad OS file handling will be your undoing quotHow ugly do you want the Ipad Pro 4 background to bequotbrbrApple Yes Apple usually picks some nice backgrounds This one is a stinker Yeah no Fuck apple product prices Now just imagine if Apple makes a 2 in 1 device I will buy it once it’s affordable just to watch Netflix and youtube on it because it has a gorgeous OLED screen I will also edit videos on it etc but mostly watch content 😁 iPad battery life is still disappointing by current MacBook standards AS 39SnazzyLabs39 Quinn said The M1 chip yeah a HUUUUGE improvement over the Intel chip at the time but Apple are experiencing 39Diminishing returns39 with their chips As each generation goes it39s ONLY only in it39s 4th gen now They are going to see less and less in performanceefficiency gains At some point 39Soon39 they39re going to have to decide ramp up the input power and expect higher temps and less battery life or make the chip physically bigger and expect higher temps and less battery lifebr😎🇬🇧 Nah I would get a heavier iPad if the battery was longer lasting No wall hugger for me I was planning to replace my 129quot M1 512GB 5G but the new iPad Pro is underwhelming Lets look at why br1 The 512GB and less models are 25 slower Only 3 P Cores  This is the top of the range model in the iPad family Why have they used pixel binned SOCsbr2 Having to purchase a new pencil and Magic Keyboard  No thanks br3 My Phone has OLED and yeah its good but £2000 good Nope br4 The Magic keyboard has had the Maclike gestures for years br5 As much as I enjoy iPadOS and can do 95 of what I need to do on it its still frustrating at times And I often dock mine with a Caldigit Dock ultrawide Mechanical keyboard and MX Master and have got used to Stage Manager but its still inferior to Dex on my Fold 4 I dock that too   brThe iPad Pro needed to add a second TB4 port brI am  waiting for the new Samsung S10 Ultra  I39m hoping the new SOC its rumoured to have will be as fast as M4 brbrI can work very well on my iPad Proand from experience  you are fooling yourself if you think you will replace a Macbook with one brbrStill I love how many quotinfluencersquot have ordered one for their YoutubeSocial Media and no doubt most will be returned once they have uploaded their content It’s sad to see how Apple can’t keep up with their top position I’ve been using exclusively Apple products for 15 years and am also own some shares Lol i found a apple fan boy after a lot of time AbuTuesday unfortunately I am  BrandonLeProktor a ce niveau

rather than their website it’s usually a dreadful waste of shoestring code in an attempt to get more data on me Just look at the British Airways “app” which pretends to be an app while it mostly just loads a web browser with limited functionality The only ipad you should buy is the cheapest one And only for your toddler Nah I’m fine with my 30 onn tablet… That was the most far from reality review I39ve ever seen The Ipad is still limited by its OS and nothing on your routine needs has been improved by the new one  compared to the old model Why isn39t there a video praising the functionality of the m2 ipad or the m1 air  that endorses the possibility of it become a oneandonly design Ipads are still toys as any other tablets I absolutely prefer my MacBook Pro to my iPad I just keep dreaming of Apple adding touch pen and 360 hinge to MacBook Pro a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt337537a Iwas laughing too😂 The M4 chip will help me watch YouTube with less lag yay I literally made

your hand  but its a horrible click bait OMG  Did any one notice bros window Where iPad will never replace macs  Developers product designers Basically all tech people in all IT industries of the world brI spent 1 week using figma on my iPad Nightmare brUnless they change the OS and somehow make pc apps work too New iPads are pretty boring tbh Just a better version of the older ones The iPad is still no alternative to a MacBook because of ipad os I39ve replaced almost all my tech including multiple iPads Macbook and iPhone with a Galaxy Fold 5 and touchscreen laptop dock One device capable of going from one of the most onehand friendly phones on the market to minitabletereader to full size tablet and touchscreen laptop to 80quot smartboard in a classroom  without signing into an app more than once or pay for more than one set of internals iOS has an advantage in software and performance but the new iPads are frankly still just perfected 2010s tech and nothing like the experience of a true single device experience that the 2020s deserve Add to that how Android has an actual desktop browser niche as Kiwi might be and these new iPads no longer interest me who was once one of the biggest supporters of iPads No matter how good it actually is im not paying that absurd apple tax for a tablet of all thingsbrHoly hell thats almost 3 grand Wtf I’ll do 2 push ups for every like this comment gets… That’s why i bought iPad Pro… One year later Huge mistake iPad os can never beat laptop … so many limitations It’s just a YouTube Netflix device with occupational PowerPoint

it39s a £100 option quotApple is as Apple doesquot 😏🤣🤣🤣br😎🇬🇧 I think the Achilles heel will be the battery lifeAnd the price obviously iglad I watched this to the end  The only reason you would get an iPad is for the nostalgic home button Thats the only reason I have one but I barely use it Just spend your money on something that has more value like the tab s9 ultra but if you already sold both

game Arun played around the midpoint is Would you give me 1 ipad 🥺 Beggar I am sorry but I cannot agree to thisbr1 The main thing is that hardware is unmatched absolutely outstanding It39s just that iPad OS is the main limiting factorThis may be subject to change after WWDCbr2 If you aren39t a graphic designer an artist or anyone needing a pen and notebook for their professional work the Apple Pencil pro really does not give you any real benefit over the standard Pencil 2br3 Apple hasn39t really fundamentally changed anything about the iPad Pro They did things no one asked for Apart from the function rows of the Magic Keyboard that is something nice The iPad39s display was already brilliant especially the mini led I don39t think anyone thought the iPad Pro was thick or heavyThe old Magic Keyboard is different though I would say the M2 was already an extremely capable chip I don39t think anyone thought it was slow even for the pro appscorrect me if I am wrongbr4 You can get 90 of what the M4 iPad Pro is offering in an M1 iPad Pro And considering the price jump that apple just did the M1 is better deal for mebr5 The quotPro Appsquot on iPad OS are nerfed ones from the MacbrbrThis is my perspective of what is going on The new iPad39s are brilliant it39s just that they aren39t justifiable for an upgrade from a previous iPad ProI am talking about 3rd generation or later The reason I am being so harsh on iPad OS is that Apple markets this tablet as a computer replacement and for most people iPad OS would be fine But you are really just better off with a Mac unless you really need a touch screenbrbrArun39s ideas are amazing though not gonna lie I never had really thought of the iPad Pro as what Arun described especially the cellular partbut I might just be better off using my phones wireless hotspot The new 39Ultra thin39 iPads I see a 39JerryRigEverything39 durabilitybend test coming soon iPhone6 39Bendgate39 anyone 😏😉🤣🤣🤣   😎🇬🇧 I will not be buying one based on my experience with ipad Air 4 My biggest problem with iPad is keyboard including  the buildin virtual keyboard the handwriting key board and the external keyboard My logitech keyboard worked well until recently in which certain keys are not working There was nothing wrong with the keyboard as it works well with my laptop and android devices The handwriting keyboard is also problematic When I highlight text the handwriting keyboard disappears To get it back I have to close and reopen the file That is very frustrating I had years of experience with samsung and huawei tablets and I have not had such a problem I love ipads especially the bigger ones I39ve had about three the only problem I have with them is if you constantly pick it on the corner there39s a lot of stress put on the the screen as it39s so thin and sure this is what39s happened to my last ipads it was always the screen that broke Gaming on an iPad sucks as well Come on you39ll say anything now No matter what hardware you put inside the only thing holding back the iPad is the iPadOS iPads got better chips to do what most budget laptops do since M1 and nothing drastic or new happened with M4 iPads iPads are not going to replace laptops for all because again no matter what they are mobile chips with few wH this will always keep being a hurdle in adoption of iPads as an alternative to PC and talking about games well RISC is good and efficient but CISC is much more mature and development is easy for CISC Still if you just look at the raw performance of the Intel or AMD any CISC based chip and compare it with an equivalent RISC chip you will find them beating RISC I personally am great admirer of RISC architecture but some things are simply just too vague to claim atm This new iPad is good but still the biggest problems with iPads remains it39s not the chip it39s the operating system it39s the iPasOS Really redesigned I don39t know if this has ever been asked but is it apple or Mkb a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt9621602a a hrefUCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV11UJgHvgfY93GEYmqvwLUuYDwAQa Such a Fanboy3600 USD nothing for him man I remember youtubers saying the same thing about ditching laptops with the last pro ipad But they quickly changed their mind because the OS sucks the ipad is really great but sooooo expensive 😭😭 I39m going to sell my kidneys 😂🤣 makes a case for the surface pro really the only downside is the chip 2 months later I was wrong  iPad cannot replace my MacBook And cracked screen will cost arm and leg dragm2123Screen will be fine I bet but in the Apple event you can already see people holding new iPads and they are bent Yeah no quotWhy I just bought itquot Because I can afford it Ironic that someone can afford a device because they can describe it to the majority of people who cannot afford it you are not gonna switch 🤷🤦 I just realized that I am listening to a sht This entire video is all about him and his life and opinions Its not really helpful for the regular consumer that doesn39t have an entire Jarvis AI powered home Just 300K more for beating the Apple yt channel lets gooo I39ve still got my M1 ipad pro and the thing I hate the most is the aspect ratio for watching videos and shows The amount of empty black space on the 13quot looks so ridiculous Thank you for sharing your great insights 🤙🍻 Just use a pen and paper damn ☠️☠️☠️ I know people complain about apple prices but they are a business…if you own a business you are looking to make profits…plus nobody is forcing anyone to buy apple products 😂😂😂😂😂 people talk about apple product they complain but then they are the first people to buy it  I have always used android phones last year a switched to apple and I must say best decision ever It is my mac replacement Why It39s called consumerism Bro is rosting samsung tablets Yes why carry a tablet when you can do much more with a phone especially with the folding phones that can literally be turned into a tablet  but can be carried as normal compact phone Its always exaggerated until some months goes by Wake me up when apple will decide to merge the laptop with the tablet software The hardest part is the will to give up all the money from all of the shepple that are buying all that it39s Apple MAYBE JUST USE A SAMSUNG BOOK 4 PRO 360 LOW PRICED TOUCHSCREEN AND WAY BETTER 3939 Bend test  Glass is glass and glass breaks  You just bought it because they are not going to send you a review unit this time 1000 dollars merely for the brand name Hell no  There goggles failed so now there going to try and sail an iPad for 3600  brbrApple is losing sells brbrApple  let’s increase the price even more  brDamn I like apple but this company is getting more and more stupid You have the price wrong 3600 Where did you get that from im a 8 tb kind of guy 💀 Why not just put mac os in it  maybe modified so ppl still buy macbooks Rocking my M1 Ipad Pro crying I can39t get this one 😂 But in all seriousness as an artist its pretty for an quotupdatequot but I dont see myself upgrading over mine Yet the new features look nice respect man Love your videos man When apple stops being cringe about storage costing hundreds to THOUSANDS of dollars extra ill consider it There39s no reason a 256 gb to 512gb should cost 350 extrathe 256 is 2199 Australian dollars and the 2tb is 3949 That39s JUST the

you can afford M1 or M2 IPads 👻🤩🤭 Ok looking forward to your review after you daily drive it to replace your macbook air and eink tab for 2 months They even freaking mentioned moving that front facing camera to the landscape side as feature 😪 i think if you find yourself needing to buy a keyboard for your iPad then really what you needed was a laptop Damn Apple is going crazy with this pricing

Wait am stupid or is this a Surface from Apple for 3x the price A massive chunk of the MacBook buyers are the software developers Making products for all of the platforms Apple won39t tap into that area with iPad as that39ll slim the sales for Mac s They are actually targeting financial intuitions and others who daily drive Chromebook or surface brbrWhen iPad will be able to run xcode and vscode and give a terminal to use Definitely gonna buy one whatever the price will be I never had a dream of buying these gadgets as my dreams can39t afford it and in reality using 3 year potao phone to watch this Good night Arun Nice video btw Trust me I39ve been an ipad user since the Ipad 2nd gen even before I started using smartphones Whenever I try to do work on an Ipad such as using Google Docs or Canvas or Google Sheets the functionality just isnt there Everything is simplified to the point you can39t really get a detailed result without an actual computer They might add this gadget and that feature to the Ipad some apps might even have all features as those on a fonputer but overall it is a pain in the ass to work with and is so time consumingbrbrIf you need a tablet to watch videos and play games Ipads are overkill and great at it If you need to do light loads on the go Ipads are a viable option But if you really wanna get work done you better still keep a computer because Ipads are just impostors trying to replace computers to no avail at least for all these years its been this way As always people hate what they can’t afford I don’t know why they expect apple to be cheap It has always been expensive And the same people who are complaining have an iPhone and all Spoiler He wont replace his laptop Reason iPad OS  Unless they update it soon I sold myself the same lie he is selling himself a while ago The hardware isn39t the problem Its the software They need to be able to run macOS for anyone to consider them a laptop replacement iPadOS is way too limited for most workflows I found it ridiculous that you iPad air is heavier I39m thicker than the pro All these are decent argument to buy an iPad just not a reason to buy newest M4 iPad in particular any modern iPad will deliver similar enough experience Laptop replacement Lol because you are replacing a MacBook If you use a Windows laptop you can’t replace like that easily unless you’re a boring user who won’t be gaming and no freedom to use the system I tried this whole iPad instead of laptop and notebook In my opinion you still 100 need a laptop Mac or windows alongside the iPad iPads are fantastic for notes All I’ve used this year is my iPad for college and I’ve never felt more productive All my notes in one place Yet some tasks were just not plausible on the iPad with the Magic Keyboard like doing an assignment on Word or PowerPoint But Arun run an experiment for yourself to debunk this My experience could be different to yours I did this I got an iPad when I was in university to draw and take notes For doing any sort of coursework or typing you need a laptop The Folio keyboard didn39t cut it the feel wasn39t the same window management wasn39t good etc You could do it but why when there39s a better option there For gaming PCsMacs and consoles exist with actual hardware controls so a controller or mouse and keyboard Yes you can use bluetooth to connect them to your iPad but then you39re restricted by the hardware inside that tablet not so much now with the M chips and the software whereas for big games the PC and console exist That39s changing now but you39re restricted by screen size then on an iPad For mobile games the smartphone exists and it39s more portable and better suited for gaming on the move If you don39t want that the Switch and Steam Deck existbrbrSo outside of YouTube and light browsing assuming you don39t draw take notes or photovideo edit what is it good for A computer and a phone are more general purpose so you39ll likely find something to use them for I love how when discussing doing work on a device literally all youtubers talk about video and photo editing as if that is what we all work on 😂 Right That39s what I was thinking lol that39s because that39s the workflow they39re most familiar with The only thing I’ll do is use discord play Roblox and watch YouTube jaydenleckpa8381 iPad 10 be like Exactly 💯 Youtubers think the pro use case is photo and video editing mostly Agreed They even run benchmarks on how quickly a bit of kit will export videoa use case for a tiny minority of users Because it showcases the over all speed of the device Its because this is specifically targeted to people who review these devices They do edit videos so they will appreciate it and hype about it Very sneaky marketing Well to be honest that is really the best application for it Wow they are talking about what the device is made for thats bad I never do video editing on my ipad i never do photoshop images on my ipad i never use office tools on my ipad… i just browse the web look through my email watch youtube and a bit of facebook For me this ipad is utterly nonsensical For other tasks i can not use the ipad programming arduino writing some silly pc programs So no certainly at this price point a big no for me So this the thing big and small YouTubers discuss this because this it what they use it there content creator they CREATE CONTENT so it makes sense be honest do you really need to know how fast Netflix app opens or how smooth the safari runs if so go to smaller channel that uses it the way you would use it you wouldn’t go to karate class and expect to learn yoga I hate to tell you but most not all do want to know how fast can a project render how smooth is creating graphics design or sound design manojgailThe iPad Pro was designed for artists editors and application developers It has MANY other LITTLE perks that other people may enjoy but they are minuscule If you are not a creator and you are purchasing the iPad Pro instead of purchasing the iPad then you mid as well set your money on fire The capabilities that these creators are going over are the biggest changes between the last version and this version it is extremely important for many of us to know what we are purchasing before we do so because we don’t want to get a machine that won’t work with our type of art style If you are interested in this because of how thin it is again the normal iPad is the same thickness buy that and save your money I mean those are very demanding activities for a computer and even more for a tabletbrbrThe majority of people who work on laptops use super light stuff like Excel or programs made for pentium 2brbrThe most demanding right now are 3d modellinganimation something that this tablet most likely can39t do but is also something that very few do professionally That is sooooo true i was gonna mention this Like for what i do for my business using an ipad and a full blown pc is more useful for me I39m an IT major so basically everything I do requires windows or Linux I just enjoy his vids I don’t think they even use iPads for video editing except for review purposes Video editing workflow with computer is way better Well gee golly garsh how dare these YouTubers not learn how to use every app Off with their heads neilbenson7346it is one of the most hardwareintensive tasks you could ask of it i know right as if they are the only ones that exist in the world Same thought A simple Java IDE is a crap in iPad Atleast its bit better in Android Tab Nothing can beat Laptop WargodFilmsagain do you think that video editing is the only work people do on a device like that WargodFilms“Hate to tell you…“ but you loved it 😂 I’m also glad you did it because I was about to write the same WanRa28 exactly it’s much better to test it with things that are demanding I would be lost without my iPad in the tattoo industry Making stencils designing images it’s hard to believe there was a time when we did it all by hand People tend to want “pro” just because it’s the best specs even though they don’t need it brI get people who just watch YouTube and scroll Facebook that want the 15 pro max even though they can save a lot with the 15 brI’ll ask them “What makes you want the Max or the Plus”brThey have no idea brThey don’t do research brEven after selling tech for almost 15 years I’m still shocked how many people do ZERO research on products before buying cagelaveyright I do illustrations and Procreate has helped immensely I can’t imagine going back and doing it all by hand Editing is soooo much easier  lol because all of the lineup is already excelproof you can do those on any tablet so it39s not exciting to talk about it in a review but when it comes to artsy things those numbers matter also these things are made for artsy thingsbrbrit39s like Jeeps offroad monsters but they never leave asphalt but when u watch a review its mostly about offroad capabilities majority of the jeep users dont even need that car but they still buy itbrbrbut i agree tho reviewers should talk about those topics too like quotif ur a common user u needdon39t need thisquot etc My workflow consists of opening spreadsheets making small edits then emailing it to other people 😅 pretty sure I can do that on a potato because that’s about the same as the computer I use Yes neilbenson7346sort of is the target audience for Apple products though I mean that’s a huge work use case Designers and media pros are a massive workforce francisverhelst9375 Right And that39s exactly why this review isn39t for you An IPad pro shouldn39t even be considered But for those who would consider it video editing talk is likely very relevant to them I record my band mix the songs and edit the videos on an M1 iPad PierreDybman sure but you’re most likely not using 4K log footage with more than 2 tracks because I have an M1 iPad and it does not handle that well Because those are some of the only things that could remotely justify a 4000 tablet Deifiable i did video editing on a 3 monitor system i stopped this hobby now I can not even imagine doing this on Ipad 😂😂😂 😂😂😂 I’d like to see how it runs Android Studio more than anything Exactly Every work that has to do with programming data science  analytics or anything IT related in general could not be carried out on this extremely expensive media consumption device GoofyPilled  you do know the iPad can do much more than video editing like creating music editing photos an architect designing a building or a house in 3d or designing your own product in 3d and then printing to with an 3d printer yes you can do all of this on an iPad and much more What else are they supposed to talk about🙄 When 2 do this… For my life  It dose nothing my phone wont do for me     PASS I got the iPad 2 new in 2011 Forgot my password sometime in 2019 but it worked perfect for everything I wanted 1 YouTube 2 music 3 temple run  4 Reddit 5 facebook 6 screenshotting everything 7 taking TERRIBLE photos brI still have it and if I guess the wrong password another 3 times it’ll be locked again for like 2 straight years Ridiculous brI could have sworn it was 6465🤣 leeseth the content should still be relatable to your audience There39s probably more people who mobile game on an iPad vs video editing Video editing for most users gets done on a computer not an iPad so there39s no point in diving into the topic Glaze over it for a sec but just a sec Because apple sucks for everything else Exactly To be fair… this video isn’t you should by an iPad or an iPad review it’s why he is spending 3600 on one neilbenson7346that because it’s so hardware intensive it’s on of the best ways to check raw power EXACTLY Until the Ipad can do serious programming I won39t be looking at an ipad for anything other than mobile games \\u200bWanRa28it39s not only about things that are demanding Like I have problems with office for Mac let alone the version for ipadOS Swift playground that is currently some kind of replacement for xcode is just a joke I can only imagine that people use that for publishing apps only not developing them There are so many other use cases that almost everybody prefers to do them on a pc not because these devices are weak but because the OS is not what they need I am doing video editing coding casual music production and graphics design But all of those aren39t my job yet What I know is that Excel on iPad is unusable because it doesn39t support pivot tables I also know that the Office suite on iPad sucks Coding on iPad sucks but video editing is fine still inferior to a laptop Music production on iPad is fine again less functionality Same for graphics design which I can utilize the Apple Pencil but the desktop app is still better brThe conclusion is that the iPad is useful for me when using my laptop is difficult It is more portable as long as you don39t get a keyboard case for it I am always using my iPad with a thing folio and Apple Pencil I tried the Magic Keyboard but it just turns my iPad into a dumb laptop I39d rather it be quotthe best tabletquot instead of being quotthe worst laptopquot video editors don39t have time to comment On pointI basically use my phone now for all the things I used to do on my Mac bookfrom downloading movies music streaming music to a sound system such as a Bosestreaming movies to the TV from an App on the phonethe list is endless and rarely do I edit videos and photosthough I enjoy taking photosyou can basically do almost anything on your smartphone these days  arielspalter7425Most companies and some schools would run analytics and statistical modelling through Databricks  which is sufficient for most Data Science projects… Well it39s because that39s the only thing that can tell how capable the device and compare it to others For average users that only use social media can be done in 100 phone you can go ahead and buy that \\u200bleeseththats fine but isnt most of the point of the review to reccommend whether a general consumer shouldshouldnt buy it 🤔 N9TT9G0AB7FQRANC9 to be fair when it39s an ipad pro \\u200bleeseth ever ipad could do this btw Ali6r but the iPad 10 is the best option for this leeseth nah ipad 10 is too much for roblox Ipad 7 does the job Ali6r well true It39s sheer ignorance For real This device would be great for artists musicians and typing up documents as well Video and photo editing are processor intensive tasks so mentioning how well it does that means its capable of everything equal and less ie Gaming or lots of multitasking Well they are youtubers It’s their reference base Yeah the new iPad slots right into your workflow mainly because you39re into jotting things down with a pen you39re more into mobile games than the big ones and you enjoy catching Netflix and YouTube while you39re out and about But when it comes down to serious work and playing PC games on the go I still reckon the laptop plus phone combo takes the cake Dislike this video Well this black and white one caught my attention It aroused my curiosity Being as thin as paper is not a selling point Give me a device with a reasonable thickness If it39s that thin I39m in a constant fear of snapping it I will never understand why we have to go thinner My phone is 10mm thick that39s perfect don39t make it slimmer Yes it39s impressive but also stupid No matter what it’s still an iPad capped by iPadOS  Insanely expensive I bought my pro 1Tb 3300 Canadian crazy 1 week later “Why the iPad cannot replace the MacBook”… and yes it is iPadOS  Stick MacOS on it already and take my money lol Anyone noticed that the sun was setting in the background 😅 Compare the iPad pro with the Tab s9 ultra a

dad to my tablet hell nah i dont even buy laptops because they are way slower than desktops plus its still an extremely overpriced apple product incompatible with most of the things i do Welcome to another episode of gadget we can39t buy Personally I couldn39t trade my computer for an Ipad I would miss the mouse and the ability to connect multiple screens at the same time I prefer to work on 3 screens at the same time Even if it did everything you need business practises matter  Opting for a walled garden is asking to be abused by both the hardware vendor and the software publishers  Ain39t that right Sony Try it out and see for yourself Arun You’ll have an amazing experience as long as you use it the way Apple intended for it to be used Start trying to do more or even have some windows open in different sizes and you’ll notice all the issues with it brbrThere’s just so much friction to do simple things and don’t even get me started on how files are handled on ipad os or ios brbrApple would never allow for this ipad to shine with all its limitations just so this doesn’t cut into macbook sales Apple also does not want the ipad to a replacement for a mac book Thus ipad OS will always intentionally be hobbled Even if the insides are identical to the macbook It really depends on who you are and what you need For media consumptioncreation it will probably be enough For a tech guy that occasionally needs to plug ethernet to configure a network that codes test and creates programs that have 3 monitors and actually use everyone of them that use his laptop to flash isos and format drives to use with other machines well the ipad it39s just a portable monitor you will always need a basic windows or mac laptop around bro u just need smart toilet Its still a PC heavy world where using a phonetablet instead is still being looked down as casual user only behaviorThe only features where phonetablets are better is entertainment due to being able to use them in your bed to watch somethingPortability too i guess but laptops still exist Title “why I bought it”brbrBecause you’re a tech reviewer and this’ll give you a lot of clicks Do it man no one’s blaming you We finally got a tablet vaguely worth using over your phone and laptop It only costs like what most people39s entire 5 year tech budget Pennies on the dollar I39m sure Wonder when I39ll be able to afford this🥹 Wonder when I39ll be able to afford this🥹 Zack is gonna have a field day with this one 😅 Hi Samsung tablet are way way way way better for taking notes at university especially if you have a Samsung phone you dont need to spend so much for it yo you was going mad deep with that thoothbrush a hrefUCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV11UJgLsMfY8P6GyckNAPjoWA8AIa Im happy i cant afford an ipad As ill only use it for youtube netflix and facebook Did Arun just make a video before buying the iPad and thus took him the whole day to film as why look at the background light throughout the video  respect to him What It39s 2024 and basically any productivity laptop over 1000€ has LTE5G from the factory or optional I have ipad air 4 with magic keyboard ipad pro 129 2017 edi  and Fold 5  These super inflated prices are like what potato PC39s use to be back when they first started to roll out in to peoples homes THIS is why i dont get angry at people who just like apple because of its features and ecosystem i get it man i really do but there are people that praise apple for everything it does ever and look really stupid when apple continues to do garbage business practices and they just ignore it or dont acknowledge it as if they know that doing so will make them look less credible or who obsess over it and argue with other people who dont like apple because of said business practices i hate apple because theyre unfathomably greedy and extremely stinky when it comes to how they handle their consumers but i can recognize the pros of using apple devices in specific use cases i myself may or may not eventually wind up buying an older iphone just so i can use the face tracking on it for 3d avatars but thats literally it So spend some 3500eur on iPad then some 700eur on keyboard and pen and you are set for next 12 months There is only one use case that might justify this thing and that is if you are an artist and you want to design with the pen and I am still not sure if you can39t do that in something cheaper like iPad air Any other ads showing doctors or engineers holding the thing is just flexing Real work is done in real production machines desktops or powerful laptops For starters after so many years of developing this thing they should have been able to put a proper OS to even consider it as a serious candidate Wow That39s just incredible 🤩 Will it bend easily cause even if we dont bend it its so thin it might bend with time and usage Pls someone answer Arun im an 8 terabyte guybrbrMe with 256gig ssd on my laptop Personally I prefer my Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 plus I get a tablet for media consumption and reading the S9 screen aspect ratio gives you a better experience not to mention the better multitasking 4x speakers that sound great more precise Spen with finer pen tipbrMost importantly I love the Samsung casing which the back cover and the front covers are magnetically attached If I need a keyboard I will remove the normal front cover and attach a keyboard cover If I want to watch a movie play games or even reading I can just detach the front cover it39s so QOLbrI love the way S9 stores the spen as well with the case built for it the pen just feel really together with the tablet unlike apple pencil which still feels like 2 different items separately The new Google Circle to Search feature is godsentbrbrFor those who need productivity yeah Ipad will have better apps and speed for it Android and Apple have both became so similar and efficient that it39s not Apple and Orange comparison anymore like that it used to bebrAnyway great to see more innovations coming in be it Apple or Android Just makes the world better Except the increasing price tag Haha It seems like MrWhosetheboss is falling into the quotiPad will replace my Macbookquot trap from which he will find out that they block so many features from the iPad for this exact reason to not lower the sales of Macbooks that using it as a replacement is impossible Exactly Apple watch to iPhone iPad to Macbook combo Wrong 🎉 I was hoping to see a video about the new Ipad if the M4 chip but instead I just got a video about tablet M4 The time flyes

insanely stupid Not a practical Super Apple D riding Fans When They See A Tablet That Is Just Thin And Has 13inch screen  costing equivalent to a super elite level pc or just anything you39ve yearned for years  Just To  Watch YT   😲😲😨😨😱😱🤯🤯🤗🤗💰💳 as a teacherdigital artist my pcworth 1000 is more than good nough I paired that pc with an M1 ipad pro for when I39m on the go and I39m all good The only problem is the  OS environment its hardmaybe its just me though to transfer my work from PC to Ipad pro or vice versa I need to use other prgrams to do thatThe new Ipad pro looks awesome but for this year I will actually choose MS Surface pro It39s crazy how apple doesn39t even put their computers in chronological order Like 1st the M3 Max then the normal M3 and then the M4 I think you got a winner here The combination of less weight then a laptop  laptop performance  apps is the future Can39t wait to hear your experience 15 percent weight drop is pretty great for the 13 inch model only the old 13 inch was too heavy for me I wonder if this solves my problem Thank you Mrwhosetheboss 👍👍👍👍😊😊 Mrwhoestheboss Just an Apple shill these days I can39t wait for Jerry Rig with this one This

excellent hardware but the software on the iPad has limited it to being just slightly more functional than a phone in most cases Sure digital art Design Yes it39s excellent But you go to do anything else and it39s almost always compromised They have the hardware they should back it up with capable software Can I have ur laptop then 1234 You need that high fidelity for those cocomelons and roblox

you don39t need unless you are a influencer For the first i have seen ArunbrFeeling difficult to get energy and explain it in his way Please Apple give us a new iPad mini No tablet is worth that much money It tells a lot about innovation that the company with the best products also has the most inhuman planned obsolescence policy Is the screen on the iPad manufactured by Samsung  No to do real work outside youtuber video editing you can39t replace a laptop or desktop with a tablet biggest apple shill on youtube hypes the next obsolete gadget he will never use but praise to heavens Nah Aren is just justifying why he bought one when he actually doesnt even need oneIts a pointless purchase imo Coming from MKBHD  As a fan I must say Iam disappointed in your opinion because as Marques said the Ipad Pro m1 can basically do all these things and its almost 3 years old A Big price tag for such small margins quotI would be cutting the size of my tech by about 5 timesquot i would be cutting by the size by 27 houses if this replaces my 2017 gaming laptop You watched the Apple event What is your current daily driver that toothbrush use 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 This video is so good which camera did you use

iPadOS you bought it because you39re rich I m surprised by a low quality review This 2024 I Pad Pro 11 and 13 inch lineup has 1 less speakers does not have a 5 G MM waive length So it does less for more money Prior I Pad Pro has those features Your review normally are pretty decent but this one is very subpar You just bought it bcz you can afford it 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I expect this man to use the ipad for the rest of his youtube career as his main rig 😭 Is like 6000 usd in my country 😢 This man took a whole day compressing the video to 16 mins to 🐐 on Apple No Arun i like you Bro but you know very well that the spec bump means nothing until they gave us the MacOS on an iPad brbrCome on Bro you are better than this Phone processors are more than enough for a tablet that runs a phone software and does the same thingsbrbrIt is a tablet fit with a computer processor that makes no sensebrbrI am pretty sure this M4 is basically the same as M3 but with some tweaks or overclocking but they want to differentiate their laptops processors from now on For that money yall can liyerally make a really OP gaming pc Love how the sun goes down outside I know a few tech YouTubers who would have waited until it’s dark before recording to have a consistent background Like if you think Apple should make a real GAMING computer and get into gaming I don39t know who tf sees a modern iPad Pro and thinks quothmm if only this was thinnerquot Well who else is watching this on an iPhone X or I’m the only one😅💔 Everyone knows it’s a good time when a new Apple product is getting released Did you use older M series iPads with their accessories Just wait for the Galaxy Tab ultra with new snapdragon  laptop chip  It39s oled just as thin and most importantly a 145inch screen The 16 x10 is also better for content consumption They need to increase the size of the I pad to be your all in one Everything else you said is true My business work will involve more travelling soon and I want a device that can run my editing software Da Vinci Resolve but I don39t want anything heavy or with a battery life that falls far too short I recently learned the Mseries iPads can get Da Vinci Resolve which is perfect and just what I need Next year I will jump from Android to iOS for the first time since 2015 so I can film on an iPhone and air drop to iPad than filming on my Pixel 8 Pro and having to upload to Google Photos and then download to my PC I have very slow internet The fact 95 of people who buy this will just watch vids and buy things online 😂 Dear Arun please make a video review about other Android tablet as well  🙏💯 what is that song at the beginning a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4000a  a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt20020a  that is very familiar Microsoft surface 2017 anyone  Please someone buy me one And I39ll work 4 u for 1 month As for it being light I really do think this is an argument that most of us geeks need more exercise tablets are a strange one there an in between of a phone and a laptop But at the moment locked to using ipadOS android would be interesting to see dual boot Apple would never do it because they39d rather sell you both but windows is already making a push for ARM support so maybe down the line we will see tablets that run windows Hey Arun bro this is was a really good video about the iPad use cases But can you make a comparison video with the tab s9 ultra or other tabs to see if the extra price really matters  Just get the 2020 one Ipad 10 th generation price cutbrGuys what do you think why not just show the history of drawing on paper You forgot to write Paid Promotion You can use your iPad to add it in Nice This iPad Pro will for sure give people the iPhone 6 flashbacks💀 i feel in this video you39re trying very hard to justify ipad as macbookbri agree it 39feels39 like laptop but thats the catch it only FEELS like laptop not works like one I mean with apples track record of locking hardware and software I can39t ever image buying one for 3 grand would love to learn about how you39re going about planning your smart home Another option for extra storage is a NAS LTT done a lot of videos and helped a lot youtubers set those up It39s your own private cloud that you don39t have to pay montly subscription for There are off the shelf plugandplay options from the likes of synology and there is the DIY route DIY is no harder than building a PC and installing an OS on it for the most part just Lego it together and write a bootable USB stick with something like TrueNAS plug it in go through the installer and off you go The hardest part of the DIY route is probably making it accessible over the internet for someone who never done it it39s gonna be a learning experience unless TrueNAS has some built in features and proxies for that I don39t know but other than that it can be done in under an hour And then you own the hardware you own the software no subscriptions or anything like that Maybe some small fee for a proxy server andor domain name to make access to your NAS easier 51 mm thin 🤔 someone bring out JerryRigg everything 😂 Welcome to the inner dialogue that every man has trying to justify his upcomming techbuy that he really doesn39t need 😅😅 An ipad cannot replace a computer keep having slide up and switch apps and pages less app flexibility and external device limitation Arun do you not remember bendgate 2018 ipads have been here before i hope they made improvements the rigidity in comparison to last time It’s a tax write off Quit yapping bs Worst video you have released Massively underplayed how limited the software IPadOS is compared with a desktop OS Also failed to criticise them for the massive 200 price hike and still no DEX eperience So much power in a great piece of hardware but I can be so much more productive with DEX on Samsung Saved me a lot of time over the years Jerry ain39t liking this one Compare both Samsung galaxy tab ultra and iPad

with the crappy music trust your voice iOSiPadOS is really limiting compare to MacOS I dunno who would use a tablet over a laptop Are you really doing it Or is it just quotreplacingquot for a week or twobrbrLots of people make decisions based on what YouTubers say in their videos and that would very hypocritical from you to say you will buy an iPad so you won39t need the laptop anymore and not really doing it brbrYou have tons of money and you can buy dozens of Apple products anytime Most of people who watch your videos don39t Think about it when you say things you don39t really intend doing Most of times i was wondering what Rohit sharma is doing in apple ipad review video 🤣🤣 Arun is a look alike of Rohit sharma I’m using an Ipad Pro M1 now I want to upgrade but will just wait until there will be more 2nd hand units in the market I find it too expensive to buy it brand new This was such a waste of your time that you did it in the comfort of your hotel room Bet it took less then an hour to make this “goofy iPad” review video Greed at its finest Yayaya another expensive shit I can39t afford It39s sad when even apple fan boys can39t fully justify this being a good product to buy now “Small cars worth” my mercedes benz 380sec cost £3015 Too much too little too late Bew i pad is like having a lion in a cage cause pratically its not good to use m4 on a tab Thank you for a great and informative video You give us insight before we take the plunge I must say that I am still on the fence in terms of pricing But overall it seems to be a great product brBTW I don39t know if you are aware that you are now so close to beating Apple Just 400000 or so to go Here comes the phone you promised to make 👍 If Apple is not careful they might be in the position where Sony Xperia was back in 2014 with the Xperia Z1 It was so thin that it came with a manufacturing defect where the screen would brake perceived as a thin line almost like a hair on the screen due to the phone being so thin and due to the phones heat it would cause this issue Will see what happens It does always feel like the different apple products are all competing against each other almost as if they’re seperate businesses entirely I love Apple \\uf8ff The greatest tech YouTuber that ever lived ❤❤❤brLove from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩 £2800you dont need it X Elite Surface Pro 10 Anyone Sucker A cheap Chinese brand

ipadOS on other models Is the ipad considered an ipad anymore tax rightoff So now that you won39t be needing the MacBook I will forward you my address to ship it 😂 apple vision pro so advance then apple went backwards with these😂 Hopefully one day we can run Xcode on an iPad Can39t wait to sell my second fliter bean All this power and yet limited by IOS Not sure if I39m the only one— But I kinda like the quotclankyquot feel of using a PC especially one running Windows To me it feels like part of the whole user experience which I like so much and that39s also why I find it hard or quotweirdquot to switch to Apple because everything is so quotroundquot and quotsmoothquot very uncomfortably so Yes I will never deny how efficient and overall better their products are but those same products remove this clanky feel I love so much also by clanky I don39t mean slow Adding onto that I absolutely hate the icons in both ios and Mac The issue with iPadOS is that your Apps working is predicated upon Apple not kicking it off the Appstore The most impressive part it39s that the new 13quot Pro it39s almost identical to the previous model A bit more power weight reduction and a marginally better screen but none of the ports sustained power versatility or outstanding battery life of the Macbook Pro39s It39s unbelievable how much the marketing it39s messing with our brains and seeing people fall for it and thinking this improvement makes it able to do way more than beforebrbrNever buy an Apple product thinking it will help you replace 2 products or you will end up having 3 devices more than the apple vision pro💀 lol  how greedy apple is and how fool people are  a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt219339a nither agree nor deny😂😂 Bro39s really just made a samsung

questions for users not tied to one particular review format  The way you look at every aspect of the advantages and disadvantages compared to the iPhone and Macbook is very interesting and it39s all presented so neatly and easily understood  Extraordinary The ipad insta app and other apps that can scale will forever infuriate me Scared of what39s gonna happen when Zack jerryrigeverything gets his hands on it I have m2 iPad Pro and see no reason why this one is any more worth the extra price  after some years we will be getting mac lvl performance on a apple watch XD Apple keep cooking the same

moral of the video tablets are useless and must be less expensive to buy  and yaa that old greedy apple less innovation more price About the storage problem of the ipad and the smart home I as an IT Homelabing Professional recommend you to build or buy a server there you can make a NAS network attached storage so you can access you data from anywhere I mean look at Linus Tech Tips Whonnock Its propostorous Its 25 PETABYTES in space Anything good or bad can be justified Still thicker than my Honor Magic V2 Bruh your a multimillionaire your hovering over the buy button over 3600 I love your YouTube channel don39t forget that you can also use your iPad Pro as a 39second39 monitor on your Macbook at any time I find this especially useful when editing photos on my Macbook Or buy a 4k

the old Samsung note 8s and what not The last one was the remarkable paper tablet and only recently just started looking for a tablet to be able to work on digital art while on the sofa But for those prices Apple just will not be a choice even though it has one of the better drawing software available for it the iPad is Apple39s Cayman and the MacBook is Apple39s 911 The Cayman will always be artificially limited to not overtake the 911 Could you do a video of the best affordable laptop for work that39s yet good for gaming brI need one that39s not labeled as a gaming laptop but has a good amount of storage for games like genshin and MC and illustrator multiple pdfs and filesbrIf there39s already a video about that could anyone give me the link please brThank you I am actually surprised that no one talks about how a pro machine is thinner than the iPad Air I mean that’s the  point of an air machine to be thinner lighter and easy to use and handle I don’t get why a pro machine is thinner than the iPad Air Remember when they pulled this same shit stunt back in 2016 with those thinner MacBook Pro that took away those ports and brought about dongle life Yes people that is what Apple has decided to do with the iPad Pro They are still missing the point after all this years that no one’s wants a thinner pro iPad that will take away all the functionality of a pro machine to fit its new form factor No one buys a pro machine for it being thin rather than getting the air iPad They buy it for the performance functionality and grade improvements over the air Bro started in the

add to any tablet yet  as long as it is not supported by the right OS and apps So I’ve had an iPad 2 iPad Mini 6 and now iPad Air 5 and each time I try to use it as a laptop alternative I always end up using my phone and MacBook combo cos iPadOS just never cuts it The iPad will always be just an iPad so long as it’s restricted to iPadOS Apple pencil 2nd generation does not work on the new ipad wtf This is literally the newest Apple Pencil until yesterday and it doesn’t work Just put McOs on the ipad and i Will buy it but for now there is no real reason to upgrade or buy the new shiny one When you have to give so much justification for a device that means you dont need it I often draw up concepts for a product 😂 never lose touch Never lose that Theres only 2 main uses I see for IPads brFor young kids not old enough for a smartphone during long boring stretches outside the home to entertain them and for professional users such as yourself or artistsbrI cant see myself needing a tablet in my home so its just something I39d use on the gobrIf im carrying a tablet it needs a bag of some sort so might as well just carry a laptop if I need it for the powerproductivitybrPlenty are thin light and battery efficient enoughbrIf I want to game on the go well just get a steamdeck or switch  I doubt the Ipad really has any substantial games that arent on phones and tbh looks like a nightmare to even try to game on if it had a full librarybrThe pencil is cool but that is quite niche I think id rather buy a notebook and pen or just get a galaxy with one if i really needed thatbrAnd for what you paid I can get a decent 2 in 1 laptop oled steamdeck and a new last gen galaxy fold and penbrNah Just nah Spoiler alert you won39t have any semblance of a usable file system at all Can39t wait to bend it like iPhone 6 Plus I switched fully to iPad Pro in 2017 and sold my Mac The most “Pro” thing I do is music production I recently bought an M3 Pro MacBook Pro and after a few days I returned it and decided to wait for the next iPad Pro There is something that feels very 2010 going back to Mac once you’ve used iPads as your main machine for so long App experiences are way better than browser experiences in most cases and I just can’t go back to the Mac Why you even bother to explain At that price the people who can afford it only need one reason to buy it because they want it brbrThe rest are just people with poor financial decision i can39t take your reviews seriously anymore Now that you and MKBHD have gone gaga  on the hypepads will wait for the Jerry Rig show  That will help me decide if I should buy this as a weapon or as a clipboard Buying a 3600 tablet is not quotsmartquot Switchin39 from a Mac to an iPad won39t cut it unless iPadOS gets a proper

Pro that I bought second hand for £500 and the last gen pencil With an off brand keyboard and track pad case it basically does the same thing in terms of laptopish functionality I still think it’s heavily nerfed by iPad OS though Not having a conventional file system is kinda rubbish for “pro” work and you still end up duplicating files within apps own storage area Until they change that better off going one step further and getting a MBP unless of course you need the pen Still no calculator Does it have something like DEX  Or is it just another high powered  tablet with no place to go dont know about this one but the previous versions allways felt like a muscle car with lots of power  but is crap on the track because it has crap handling in the curves Just finding the button to report it  I sell ipads but am not interested in using one make sure you let us know your long term thoughts on the matte screen and if you have any build quality issues with the thinness the ultimate baby shark watching machine I’m genuinely afraid I’ll bend this iPad if I were to carry it in my bag I can’t imagine anyone asked for the iPad Pro to become even thinner They should leave that to the Air It’s in the damn name Because you have disposable income and can’t help to brag I miss the outro music… All the perks of a laptop  That39s quite the reach just the basic perks which almost any tablet can do email keyboard etc One of the key things it still lacks the ability to code  It would be so cool if it could run xcode on it  Simple\\xa0brbrYou bought the new iPad so you can post about it on YouTube and generate ad revenue for those that don’t use adblockers brbrI like adblockers Ngl Xiaomi pencil is better That thick bezel though Someone once asked me quotare you that dumb to be needing that many smart things in your lifequot and honestly there39s really no good reason to be relying on smart things to live your daily life except as an excuse to not remember stuff or taking good care of yourself by needing gadgets to do it for you I pad make sense if you are into digital art Apple have been slowly balance the use case for iPad iPhone and Mac for years improve one over the other for sometimes only 6 months just to makes every category still sells They could easily only sell Macs or only improve iPads to a point to stop selling Macs but need that balance to sell both and make the most money Arun now you are doing it wrong brother … I hope u understand In this vid you are almost pushing people  forcefully to switch to an ipad which is soo wrong Remember one thing an ipad is an ipad no matter how powerful it is but a mac is a mac You cannot  try to influence people to opt for a iPad instead 😷 this is soo worng amp yeah btw this is your worst video ever this video deserves a dislike  👎 as if  apple paid you to make this video This video is soo uncomfortable to watch amp understanding that the amount of reach youve got amp  how people may subconsciously oopt  for an iPad after watching this video mrwhoistheboss Too thin and doesn39t look durable brThin isnt s thing when you put it in a case  Where39s the Mini Don39t do it its an insane price Couldn39t they have just shifted the Apple Pencil magnets to the bottom of the tablet Imagine someone with the whole ecosystem of the keyboard the pencil and the iPad who wanted to upgrade If you want something as a replacement for a laptop it is stupid to buy an iPad because the iPadOS cannot run the apps which run on MacOS Why dont you instead buy something like a Galaxy Book 4 360 It is a laptop with Windows and when you flip it around it becomes a tablet with the support of an SPen What39s that writting tablet Can you please do a review on it I think with this price I can get a RTX 4070 with i9 13th gen PC with 16 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD 😌 For it39s price it39s trash I really appreciate your hard work and the entertainment that you bring us with your videos Thank you so much ❤ how reflective is the screen because normal oled tvs are like mirrors and using oled tvs in the dark is a great way to destroy your eyes so i wonder how apple fixed this for their ipad pro when using this in the daylight My pc costs more than that I know you are a hype man everything tech is hype but this ipad will break that streak It is an amazing piece of technology Except it is 100 useless The software holds it back It cannot do anything properly all features are the worst possible solution to make sure not to step on macos territory Unless apple updates ipados there is no point in upgrading  buying this

using please  Link  Wedding invite movie Drisha climbing that wall publish here please You can have cellular on iPad without having a plug in modem Wow the price increase is almost 50 since iPad pro M1 Long time ipad user here also I am a developer I love my ipad I use it everyday but 70 of the time to take notes by writing 25 of the time to watch something 3 as a second screen to my mac when I am traveling and 2 random apps chrome etc  Other than that it is nowhere near to replace a laptop This is by design I hate Apple for this They are not allowing us to utilize the hardware You can39t even code on it properly My sister who is aillustrator love it of course She utilizes the hardware way more than me But my point is it39s not even close to replace a laptop I only recommend it if you can afford it or expense it You can buy an 39A39 grade  M2 11quot ipad pro 2TB cellular from cex for £1150 I was originally thinking of getting the new air 11quot 1TB cellular but that would be £1249

guilty for wanting the new fancy tech  you’ve earned it bro ☺️ I hate Samsung so much Using your views to pay for ridiculous priced iPad 28k nice trick  BTW I have an M1 iPad pro and see no reason to change Ugh You completely brushed over how absolutely obscenely overpriced and limited this is and just hyped it start to finish is just 106 fanboy Probably the most unbalanced review I’ve seen in ages Jerry is getting ready to zigzag that screen and back Carter  give mommy back her iPad This seems to be  a huge upgrade for the ipads and the the company itself Well If you can find what to do with it Then awesome But in my opinion If you think the iPad would replace your Mac Considering the limitation of apps for iPad OS Then I don39t see any reason you can39t use Samsung39s best tablet It39s also as thin and powerful for tablet use cases Plus you get more games all while being cheaper brbrHonestly man I know you don39t mind the expense but if you really feel you can replace your work setup with the iPad You would be completely fine with Samsung brbrI honestly don39t like the fact that we encourage these companies to price their products ridiculously brWhy not sell the whole gadget together brbrWhy would a pro user buy the iPad without the pencil and folio if they Apple claim they want it to replace the Mac brbrIt39s just like selling the Mac without the trackpad and keyboard Just ridiculous We by we those who just rush and buy apple products without thinking it through properly are the reason they keep charging ungodly fees just as MKBHD put it for their really not so innovative tech It sucks Because you want to review it 😂 I used to have an ipad mini 4 but after i bought the iphone 14 pro max i havent used it All that money just to watch Netflix on  With portable devices you sacrifice quite a bit for the portability often the price and the power apple found the secret which is to charge a lot of money for everything lol For me it39s definitely very tempting for all the same reasons Can39t wait for the nanoultrascreen to find its way to Macbooks You can39t run adblock on iPad OS mouse support is pathetic You39re better off on a MacBook Air You probably never heard of Adguard It works on Macs as well as on the iPhoneiPadAndroid Let39s not go down this route again The iPad might seem like it would be good as a laptop replacement but the reality is that you will encounter situations where you can39t do what you want to do and would have been able to do it on a Mac I39m typing this on my 14quot M1 Pro MacBook Pro and still loving it Zero desire to upgrade Maybe the M5 Pro but even then my M1 Pro doesn39t hold me back so I39ll probably just save my money when I started watching this video I got an advert for the new ipad Bro im watching somebody who doesnt like tablets by a 3600 dollar tablet while im watching on a old ipad air 😭 I use my ipad pros as my main computer when I39m out and about M1 is plenty fast for any music editing recording composing Definitely more useful than a laptop for my use case Do you connect an Audio Interface to your iPad RabianskiT I39m a pianist so my 39recording39 work is done via midi controller keyboard so no Got an interface at home plugged into my pc for any vocals etc it isn’t a replacement it can’t do nearly as much as a computer Worst Apple ad ever No rick roll this video shocking How much did you charged apple for justifying such a ridiculous price 😂😂 You say samsung tablet still use mobile chips 😂😂 while also admitting that ipads are powerful but can do much less work than macs due to software Extremely powerful social media machines😂 I have an m1 iPad Air and I use it all day at home I’d say it was worth it for me considering how much I use it but there’s zero reason to upgrade it How powerful of a chip do I need for the limited ipad OS I think stage manager is the best iPad OS feature since it makes the iPad more laptop like with the multiple windows but I’ll be damned if apple think I’m ever upgrading to a more powerful social media machine for £2000 I get they don’t want to take away from MacBook sales but that really shows how money hungry they are Ipad is overrated brDon’t know why but every tech youtuber promotes ipad guys if u are broke its ur problem STOP with the THIN give us battery and features Forget about the power and price some of apps like Instagram doesn’t have an Ipad optimised app they have iphone’s layout It feels such a waste of screen area when you open it I can39t wait so I can check emails and watch youtube on it bro

I am just waiting for quottech purchases I retreatquot video Pretty sure there will be an Ipad I dont need to watch this video as soon as in the apple presentation the guy says quotthere is no such a device in the worldquot when speaking of a fucking tablet I know its just a marketing brain wash thats all Some cheap chinese tablet which is 10x cheaper will do exactly what this over priced piece of shit will As an apple fanboy I’m spending the more or less on a gaming pc Apple needs to get a grip Quality of their products is declining and prices climbing that toothbrush clip was diabolical You have 18 million subs you can afford an M4 iPad Ipad Air 13inch is 😍😍😍 Another clickbait thumbnail hum You don’t have the device man… think mkbhd39s impressions were a lot more grounded than yours

most of the time i think Pin me bro I reckon he will go back to his macbook during a week Iphone 15 pro was kinda the same choice for me in terms of AI I like to know what my device will be able to do before buying it the fact you still don39t know the battery capacity is wild especially with a super thin device Apple defo hiding the battery life from people and thinking they can fix it with an update This isn39t the 15 pro so lets hope they can pull it off again I did visibly notice the Ipad they had on display in Westfields battery was draining whilst plugged in running the video editing app forgot the name of it but that39s kinda concerning hopefully it was just a dodgey charger Arun is tempting more than the apple event I am watching this video and I only thought the product already exists that lenovo laptop which has 2 chips and 2 os Which is windows and android whichever you want to use We all love watching products we can’t afford That thing is gonna bend so easy don39t do it man get an iPad Mini and keep your laptop it will cover the needs you metion in the video US 3600 for a tablet Wow the price you pay to surf the net while lying on your bed 3600 that39s a lot of cash

OUTRO BACK They made a surface pro but for 10x the price Funny timing of this ipad release since arun just made a video about the costs of having apple products repairedbrbrThose thin ipad pros are definitely going to be expensive to have repaired well Using word and microsoft paint isnt something that39s new to tablets imagine spending nearly 3k on something that can be stolen or broken in seconds just because its light But I guess its pretty smart to review whilst purchasing it quotlet me make a video of me buying the Ipad and that will pay for itquot My 2 year old son will love watching Bluey on this Nice tablet Just a shame it is made by Apple Very interesting video Since stage manager I use my iPad Pro M1 more than my Mac for the reasons you stated Side note you can just link your android phone directly to your iPad Pro and import photos I took my pixel 4XL on holiday for using as a spare camera unlimited uploads free and then just linked it to my iPad Pro and copied all the photos across in the photo application No AirDrop no problem I also swap to S24 Ultra and I use the app Blip to substitute AirDrop is brilliant Bro doing everything to convince himself to buy

will say this again quotLaptops are gonna be obsolete one day replaced by tablets whether you like itbelieve it or notquot Feels like this video has been made by someone after every single iPad release When it won’t even replace the Remarkable in the end Apple needs to do something similar to Samsung dex for the ipad So allow Mac os to run on it They39d sell like hot cakes with a more desktop experience I’ve ordered one I’ve had the 2021 iPad Pro for a while now and the blooming has been a constantly noticeable thing More than anything I’m really excited for the switch to OLED I love tablets But this is overkill Great computer so how to run localhost server browser inspect element terminal xcode android studio or vs code Oh wait Definitely concerned about a future that is primarily on apps You lose a  lot of functionality in terms of being able to compare prices and have power over your own web experience You become locked into their ecosystem and their ads I feel like

lot I wouldn39t buy a tablet from Apple because they have too many shortcomings  It would be better if you bought a tablet from Samsung I bought the M1 iPad Pro when it came out thinking it could replace most of what I do with my laptop Turns out iPad OS just really sucks It constantly reminds you that it’s not a real OS A really simple example  compare the print menu on iPad to a Mac Might not sound like a huge deal… until you need to print something and you can’t rotate enlarge print twosided etc Tons of small things like that you don’t even think about on a Mac but are really

being away from home meeting some colleagues and some apple guy has sold you the story of why you need an iPad brDude stop acting “sheeply” and spend more time with the misses instead of hyping an

not going to hoard 100 apps for 100 shops day night different Did you see the sunset how long did it take him to take the video That39s a lot of money for a tablet It would be cool if they could integrate MacOS into the iPad Pro like a surface book He needs to stop talking about his wedding to Yoko Ono No one carers if he’s gay Really dislike how there39s 4 different pencils now and they only work with specific ipads brbrMad You know why benchmark apps are faster on iOS Because they are optimized for that specific platform Android phones are so varied in CPU and RAM configuration that it39s not possible to optimise for it in a general way So when you see single core performance being higher on an apple device it39s because the software used to make that benchmark is optimised with that architecture in mind Does it have lidar I NEED TO KNOW 👹👹👹👹👺👺👺🤡👺👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹 does it have a calculator tho No one optimizes apps for ipad a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt364604a wow

quotWhy I switched from my iPad to my macquot but seriously why get an iPad even if it have every app you need the Mac will still run those apps better  the mac is cheaper and the iPad isn39t that smaller it39s 13 inch the way I see it is that it39s an overpriced touch screen MacBook air  I would still say the Tab S9 and the Tab S9 Ultra with Samsung Dex capability is just way superior compared to the iPad with a very average user experience with iPad OS The Galaxy tabs are also equally thinner and the Tab S9 ultra is an absolute beauty The only quottabletquot that makes sense is something that works as a full laptop but then you use the screen to more comfortably watch stuff or handwrite Surface Pro style The biggest issue of the iPad is iPad OS It needs MacOS iPadOS is crap Wtf higher than vision pro  Is it  Oyyu Congrats and best wishes on the upcoming nuptialsbrLove your work for yearsbrThanks for all the hard work ipad kid I strongly disagree on the app versus web thing 910 apps

MacBook with touchscreen and compatible with Pencil ProbrBye bye iPad 👋 at that price id rather get an apple vision pro People talking about how ipad could completely replace a laptop for years now it have a quotlaptop chipquot since 2021 with the M1 the issue is not how strong or capable the iPad itself is but rather Apple that intensionally limits it in the software and this won39t change this year I already ordered it at the keynotethen cancelled it I reconsidered the following I will buy it if the iPad finally is quotgetting loosequot as Apple promised If I can fully replace my MacBook I will buy the most expensive iPad and sell my MacBook Probut maybe Apple doesn39t want me to do that So it all depends on next month39s WWDC iPad 10 gen is the best due to its prices and performance rather than these iPads they cost almost as much as a flipping pc 😅 Stick with the MacBook Pro use the iPad by using something like Jump Desktop to connect remotely to the MacBook Pro where required That solution works for me For the love of God stop saying quotApple made the best screenquot when it39s a Samsung and LG panel Apple does not make displays These are Samsung39s panels People somehow still don39t realize a lot of Apple components are made by Samsung like their memory their screens and several other components Wow kinda early TIM COOK Let39s see you fix this new iPad of oursbrLOUIE ROSSMAN Repairing a malfunctioned Mac is one thing but a broken iPad is another issue this new iPad gets me asking why apple insists on keeping a notch their laptops I’m good with base model 1299 😇 If this comment gets 1000 likes I will buy the iPad Pro M4 quotOh god I39m going to consooooooooomquot Then give it to me so that i can start practicing animate Can I have one Who cares what you gonna buy bro most powerful tab but can it run calculator app Boss vs markus Why so expensive 😅 a wow that39s just incredible I should be able to plug it in my car and get self driving features Is it even worth to upgrade from the m1 ipad pro tho for someone who just plays Call of Duty Mobile 😂 Does Samsung have a patent on every practical aspect of a stylus Apple seems to make a balls of the execution every time But the tab 9 ultra… iPad os is pretty useless No it’s not somedayand that day might comethe iPad will kill the MacBooks…in terms of sales n specs performance Cheddar cheese 🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀 Unnecessary A normal human people you see walking on the street most people writing comments here will never need something like this or be able to purchase it Ok can I have the ipad after though Broke student over here 😂 for a normal use yah go for it  But for intense use like rendering  serious photoshop or stuff like that  i highly doubt if an ipad is a good way to do it Remember it still runs iPad OS lol at the tech reviewers responses to thisbrMkbhd who asked for thisbrDave2d we’ll see maybebrMrwhosetheboss I’ve already ordered one and plan to make it the center of my life This is a revolution in personal computing Love how you can see it getting darker and darker though the video The millionth tech YouTuber saying he will replace his laptop but never ends up doing it because the lack of a cooling fan in the iPad means it runs much slower than the macbook for prolonged work like video editing It39s not about the fan which either MacBook Air has it More about the software side these quotpro appsquot they keep calling is the quotkiddiequot version of the actual pro apps they have on WindowsMac It’s because it can do a lot but it’s still technically more inefficient and time consuming to do things on it since it’s limited by the iPad OS People really want to be able to replace their computer with it because it’s everything in one but the software just makes it not an amazing experience The mac doesn39t have a cooling fan WDYM macbook air m1 m2 and m3 has no cooling fan After few months he and everyone else will make a video why the new apple iPad pro was not what they expected or titles like 3600 waste bec not upto markbrIt39s the same cycle for all of them Macs dont have a cooling fan lol Apple Sillicon chips are based on mobile chips therefore they dont need extra cooling That39s the reason why you dont hear any kind of noise in a mac I assure you my ipad pro m1 does not heat up nor does it lag on the apps it handles even 100mb autodesk files where my s21 ultra chokes Its not really about the ipad not having enough cooling but the ipados itself is the problem The file system the restrictiveness of ipados compared to the mac and the software support is laughable considering you have an M4 inside even the M1 is still an overkill \\u200bbintangg6506the airs dont have cooling fans the pros do namrehtv2746they have better passive cooling though bintangg6506 MBPs have fans 70 of people could probably easily replace their laptops with tablets because most people are not really using high demanding software that has a lot of workload Not everyone is editing videos using rendering software or coding You are right the iPad Pro with MSeries SOCs lack active cooling and unlike the Macbook Airs they have limited ability to dissipate heat via the chassis Remember while a laptop may sit on your lap and get a bit toasty though your trousersjeansskirt etc the iPad is held in your hands and so has to run cooler It throttles very quickly when used intensively Kiwiaviatornz My Mac Studio does a bloody big one so did my M1 Mac Mini bintangg6506 A lot of Macs with Apple silicon do have a cooling fan Mac Mini Macbook Pro mac Studio Mac Pro The iPad Pro gets hot and throttles quickly as its a device held in your hands and if it got too hot it could cause injury and lawsuits As the OP said when used for quotpro longed tasksquot and he39s correct I use one daily micksmithson6724 laptop TheMrkalkbrenner Even if you use File Browser Pro Highly recommended btw file management generally takes longer  I work overseas and travel a lot so often use my iPad Pro as a daily driver and you are right for most people its overkill they would be better off with a Chromebook But the clue is its called the iPad quotProquot so it should be professional quality and sadly it isnt As much as I kind work around most issues you still run into boundaries \\u200bnamrehtv2746 nope the airs don39t have a fan No cooling fans since the M chips… except he literally said that he is going to try it out to see IF an iPad could replace his Macbook You didn39t get the point Bro THE IPAD HAS THE BEST CHIP EVEN BETTER THEN THE LAPTOPS IT IS SO MUCH BETTER USING THE IPAD PRO bintangg6506  ALL M series processor macbooks and most Mac39s have active cooling except for macbook air denisbusuioc1885 the macbook has a similar powerful chip also STOP YELLING BRO This is just to show that an ipad can do this but in real life no one uses an ipad to edit videos even drawing on it is awkwardbrPeople spend thousands of dollars just to look rich and the ipad pro with m4 is a good example of that It is not about the fan the issue is with keyboard cover it is much heavier than macbook air but no softwaressuitable os It just makes no sense azizaja8255 the software I use which is the affinity suite and clip studio paint is 11 the same on iPad as it is on pc or Mac It depends on what software you use Right they might as well just say it39s a paid sponsor 😂😂 denisbusuioc1885 Only if comparing to the Airs MacBook Pros are still leagues ahead of iPad for now Love the people saying macs don39t have fans lol All the airs that don39t have fans actually need one because apple sends the SoC on them to around 100C and then sheds the heat onto the RAM and storage because they share the same heat spreader Doubt he bought it to keep Bought it to do the review then sends it back for a refund \\u200bbintangg6506pros do have a fan right \\u200bbintangg6506yep Macs don39t have fans but they have heat sinks which reduces throttling Gawd this tech dude is reviewing or should I say finally discovering iPads with the mind of a Windows and Android user \\u200bnamrehtv2746 the pro line up has fans Arun uses the pro macbooks Kiwiaviatornz the pros do airs do not bintangg6506 yes they do azizaja8255Davinci Resolve hollywood standard has their full desktop version running on iPad  so is Lightroom  How misinformed you are and how well paid I am

The ipad is the ONE apple product that I would like to ownbrbrObviously I39m not gonna spend over 3k on a tablet but I would ilovei to have it lol Especially good for artists I have an M1 iPad and I would never buy another one As much powerful and sleek this device is the OS is just so bad for tiniest of task Very limited and restricted Unless you are a creator or student DO NOT BUY I am regretting my decision why I didn’t buy an Android tablet Useless Love ur vids ❤ I’ve predicted in the past that iPads will end up having a containerised MacOS instance that you can use alongside iPadOS surely the technology is here now The pro would actually be fitting of its name thenbrbrI also hope that will be the future for smartphones where Android phones can plug in and have a full speed Windows OS available For artists what photo editing app is that The multicam final cut for ipad plus final cam up to 4 iPhones at once is a great addition If it can run Football Manager full game is all that matters Only 13k likes in 1 hour Bro fell off Most powerful  machine for playing  ludo and watching  youtube netflix and anime I haven39t used a tablet in almost a decade and the fact that thing is so thin concerns me I39m not a gently person with my electronics so I39ll need a cover that rend the whole quotthin and lightquot irrelevant Plus I do love a big screen Is there a 15 or 17 in version Although the thinness sounds really good for weight reduction I feel like it would make the iPad too fragile I would worry about putting it in a backpack especially after watching

JerryRigEverything to bend that thing Codm finna go crazy It39s funny how Apple controls the tech space😅 Me sitting here watching this on my iPad 5 mini 😂 I think this video is just a long

on every device If you want good apps on every device you have to pay for a lot of developmentbrbrWebsites gt apps I’m still on an m1 iPad Pro prior to which was a 5th gen pro always 129 I see no reason to upgrade for what I use it for I do have it 5G enabled with a basic sim deal from EE I pay about  £10 and family share my data from my mobile phone contract  You raised a good point about the battery life we’ll wait and see Nah i ll rather get a pc bruhh Its almost time to build the world39s largest iPhone all the perks of ipad you mentioned are for youtubers maybe new ipad is useful to you to make youtube videos There isn39t any feature for the general public who watches your videos brbrWhole video is about what quotyouquot can do with the new ipad It39s crazy how these YouTuber are able to accept apple simple mistakes but would complain the entire video if Samsung had had those mistakes Hallelujah I39m the favorite 60000 every week Now I can afford anything and also support the work of God and the church For me it was always iPad  right from the start I bought the OG iPad because watching movies on something so cool and portable was amazing  compared to our bulky laptops back then From there it gradually increased to tasks like online shopping reading ebooks bit of gaming  and now I edit all my YouTube videos  thumbnails and shortform videos on it For me the most important gadget in my home besides my iPhone is my iPad So much so that if it breaks I will run to the store and get one right away Still feel a samsung tab would be better Apple devices are seriously well made and I can completely understand why people buy into them but holy crap do they price their stuff ridiculously high £3500 is an obscene amount for something that will likely be made redundant quickly Don39t get too existed Arun I got all of them MacbooPro iPad Pro iPhone Pro Max Apple Watch Airpod Pro However the most useless device is the iPad Pro because It39s not a phone and it39s not a MacBook Probrgt Many of the MacOS Apps are not compatible to iPadOS and it39s making it useless until that changesbrbrEditbrFor example br Virtual Machines Parallel desktop isn39t working where I can use Windows I want on the machine not a remote onebr Office 365 on Mobile is still very limited especially Excel for a professionalbr Adobe Photoshop is still not the full version on itbr Many of my programming software are still not compatible with iPadOS So the fact that it is still a Mobile OS is instead a disadvantage than an advantage And looking at the price I39d rather use a Macbook Pro with an old iPad than a new iPad without a Macbook pro a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt575935a Bruh not all of us are youtubers editors and artists We are still in the PC first world nothing will beat actual PCs rn well not in the form of a tablet anyway Yea yea there may be some people who will replace their laptop or PC with a tablet but that will be a very small amount of people Don39t get me wrong I have an iPad too the 129 m1 pro one which I use as a media device for example to watch movies in airplanes or when I39m too lazy to get to my laptop but it will never replace my laptop which is my primary work non apple software engineering and gaming device So expensive for à machine Apple launches new product tech suckers buy itbrbr3 months later you won39t be using it still it39s an IPAD it has no use case except for flexing it in public and slowly realising nobody cares if you39ve got an iPad or a MacBook its easy to compare it to a laptop when you talk about performance but can we all just keep in mind that this thing has only 1 port Having an M1 iPad Pro 1139  and a M2 MacBook Air 1539 myself the ONLY difference I feel in performance is in the OS All I want is a better way for file management and the freedom to download anythingeverything like you already can through any browser on Mac and I would never buy a Mac or any other PC ever again Every other service I personally needed a machine or gaming console for is already on some sort of cloud streaming service already  I believe they39re waiting for Mac sales to be utterly garbage worse than to already is at least before pulling the trigger to unleash iPad39s full potential Will never consider getting Apple products Android user and want to switch to any Android device but still watch because I like tech and Mrwhostheboss So I got the Note 20 phone watch 6 and the Tab s9 and I am so happy with how they work together especially the earbuds switching between the active device and that the tab and phone comes with a pen plus multi tasking Same I have to admit that those new iPad Pros are rocking really cool hardware but at their current absurd price they39re simply out of the question Not to mention that iPadOS is so locked down in terms of functionality that it would be like driving a Ferrari to go to work I love my Tab S9 and can39t find a single reason to upgrade anytime soon kiwisorbet Exactly some nice features but not something to compromise for like the dynamic island thing I liked but it is still an iphone and the Samaung has the light up edge with notification pop up Wait until while Jerry will bend it like a paper 😂😂😂 I am so used to being marketed to that I expected a discount code to his wedding at the end of the video Even though a wedding isn39t a paid event Arent you married already  no matter what I still don39t get the idea of using iPads with keyboards if you39re intended to use it like a laptop then buy a mac I bought iPad 34 years ago because of pencil and this is how they can still going with ipads  If there wasn39t apple pen there is nothing rest unique on ipad Some NBA players use a ipad as a phone bc it has cellular and their hands are so big😂 then theres us talking about it like a laptop It is only 3 am bro is time traveling 🤯 Does it have 120Hz Looks really smooth Literally useless without macOS Does it come with a calculator that39s my biggest question As a Google user from the beginning  I had to admit Ipad Pro was the best choice for my hobbies Bought my first 2020 changed to m1 and now definitely going to buy this new Using external storage is easy nowadays also MS OneDrive integration is working fine no need iCloud I forgot where my Windows laptop is Using the tablet for reading and watching  gaming is much easier and better Also heaving logic keyboard and mouse which connects to the tablet using my HP docking station for having an external screen and more ports feels like a proper laptop would get one but you can39t really code on the ipad as you cant access the terminal to my knowledge  I don39t think an iPad is better to be used as a Mac The use of the power on the iPad isn39t gonna be maximized like it would on the Mac Not to mention features and compatibility For the things you use an ipad for you would be fine on an older ipad M1 or lower You do nothing on there that requires any power tbh I doubt you39re using iMovie to make your youtube videos Idk man I gave up laptop life in 2016 for a purely mobile experience between my iPhone and iPad Here I am today with an iPhone 14 Pro Max and a 129quot M1 iPad Pro and I wish I had bought a laptop instead I39ve tried using this thing a ton of different ways but more often than not I39m just way more able to accomplish tasks efficiently on a Windows computer than I am an iPad and I39ve been using Apple products for most of my lifebrbrUntil they put iOS on an iPad it39ll just be a super expensive entertainment device iOS is on the iPad I hate how everything is going to apps Everything is becoming a download requiring an account being locked down and largely unmodifiable Websites can be good but everyone poured money into the apps instead of making sure their site worked better Also generally sick of iPad being ALMOST great But until they just allow me to use both iOS and MacOS on hardware that absolutely can let me do that or until they include the full suite of phone benefits like the full range of cameras and sensors it39s useless to me I don39t want to buy three interconnected devices I just want the one and until that happens I don39t feel the need to overspend on overhyped locked down hardware stuck in its own little bubble away from my entire current PC and Android based ecosystem Samsung S9 ultra is still better and cheaper until i use an ipad like my macbook pro this is over specced i have thousands of songs in itunes and use it to sync with phone and ipads can39t do that with an ipad as the core database Until developer tools become available I will give it a wide berth Just unlock the device to allow a power user to use the full features of iOS a

close to Macbooks in performance the price is getting up there too if you include memory and the keyboard thingy At the same time it doesn39t actually have feature parity and while we do actually pay more for MBPs at work because the price is in our eyes worth it I would hesitate to splurge what is pretty much a pretty good gaming PC on what at the end of the day is still a tablet Cant wait until jerryrig everything get their hands on this The new wallpaper actually spells “pro” a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6111011a Nice catch Bro edits faster than me dad left me That ipad no shit cost more than my house dear all or some your complain we have already in Samsung Tab S9 😅 Was that a Motorola Xoom Great video but if you swap your  laptop for an iPad I recommend you keep the remarkable tablet as the e ink screen is less harmful for eyes and sleep So like a Surface Pro then Trouble is when you want to jot down notessketches while reading or working You need two devices then and then you are back to laptoptablet Apple doesn39t want you to buy just an ipadbrThey want you to buy apple Note to self All you do is watch YouTube Rumble or read a newspaper DO NOT BUY May of my classmates in university used an iPad with a keyboardcover instead of a MacBook The iPad did everything the MacBook did and paired with their iPhone seamlesslybrOne problem I saw with their iPads was they weren39t as durable as the MacBook Many of their iPads screens were broken when they dropped them or had them in their school backpacks and got them crushed from books or pointy hard objects inside that cracked their screens uner pressure on the device insidebrLooking forward to seeing how you use it and share it with your audience on your platform For that amount i would go for the best laptop within that price But honestly until Tablets can have the EXACT or more power as a full flagship laptop then tablets will always be obsolete  But the form factor is better if tech can get there you can buy a top end laptop or pc for that price That spec and performance seems unreal with stunning picture quality actually looking forward to seeing you get your hands on it and doing a full review It39s either a sarcastic comment or a bad take I’ll take your macbook if you don’t need it please thanks wait is the apple pencil now more thicker than the IPad Just give the users the option to use IDEs on iPads like Xcode or vscode natively and you’ll see a lot of new users getting iPads instead of computers Damn Arun  it39s your first time reviewing an ipad Apple are literally laughing all the way to the bank People are so misguided now they39re paying 3k for a flipping tablet Very few people are You can get an iPad for 349 FYI So we don39t need to buy a MacBook I can39t wait for the launch of the new Macbooks and then hear what all the YouTubers have to say about them compared to iPads 😂 Again another Awesome vid from Mrwhosetheboss The content is always amazing always getting better and better can39t wait to see you overpass Apple in subcribers bs Give me MacOS and i might consider buying it I39m still using ipad mini 6 It39s good enoughbrN my s24 There39s rarely a bad take here but when there is it kills lol I really need the new iPad it’s awesome but I can’t afford it 😂 Hey man I watch your videos a lot and I like them very much because of the pace colors and themes and something just disappeared in this video most of those things actually brI mean the music was nice in the dark background is pretty cool but it39s not your style it feels scripted from Apple😅brbrBut nothing too much just an insight form me to one of my favorite YouTuber brGood luck with designing your new place 👍 Apple devices and whatever chip they make are not worth it if u wanna game Apple products only work great with apple made apps which u dont get with the product and gotta buy it separately These rigged up things by apple nowadays make me hate this company more and more Those blacks are so deep 💀 I actually tried using the previous iPad Pro as a laptop replacement for 2 months at the end of last year and my conclusion is that it is not ready for that and probably never will be Here’s my list of issuesbr1 Stage manager is still fiddly and managing apps when you have a lot of them open is both quite restricted and a lot of effort eg having more than one instance of the same appbr2 A lot of apps are simply not designed for using a mousekeyboard meaning you have to lift your hands and touch the screen for sometimes basic actions including in the OS itselfbr3 using an external monitor is not very good because i it sometimes crashes and all open apps move to the iPad screen meaning you have to click the 3 dots on top and move them to external monitor ii issues 1 and 2 get magnified iii personally I hate how the OS manages workspacesvirtual desktops independently in each screen which means you have to click way more often than what I am used to on other OSbr4 you always depend on apps to do everything which can get expensive but also makes working on it as a programmer not very good due to lack of a basic console and other features of more open OSbr5 lack of ports… it has 1 USBC which means you NEED a dongle or a dock at all times if you need to plug in 2 things or more or 1 thing  chargebr6 Pencil is good but if you want to use it intermittently for typing  drawing then be prepared to fiddle around until the OS recognizes that you don’t want to use the pencil anymore This is worse when not having a keyboard connectedbr7 I wholeheartedly disagree with your assertion that programs are developed with apps as a focus This might be true for entertainment but if you actually want to do work on iPad OS you will find that these apps have countless limitations lack of features and annoyances and are generally much slower than their laptopdesktop counterpartbrbrHopefully this stuff gets better with time but I realized that this is unlikely Apple doesn’t want the iPad to be a competitor to the MacBooks and viceversa they don’t want the iPad to become the “MacBook with touch” They want you to buy both and an iPhone I think you will find that big phone  laptop is a much better and flexible combination that achieves 95 of what’s needed making the iPad almost redundant Any other combination of 2 of these products satisfies a lower  of what you need The bonlyb exception being that if you need the Pencil to make money then you should get the iPad Otherwise spare the 2k Mobile apps but bigger 😂😂brAlso why send photos to iPad to edit if you already have a MacBook brAlso an ipad for 3600 dollar is just overrated My girlfriend got me into apple from android as a pilot and a truck driver I find the apps better for flying and driving and it’s more secure than android Bro buys and makes a video about a new product before I even know that there39s a new product Love that Arun is branching out from just reviewing phones From a ipad mac windows user There are just some inconveniences using ipad as a laptop replacement Mainly due to ipados I tried But it just doesnt I bought a Dell 2 in 1 for 600 and put Linux mint on it The UI is acceptable for touch and the writing apps are absolutely amazing It has a many core amd and I just used to do my thesis in Matlab and Vivado this thin thing is a beastbrbrThis was 3 years ago and still use it daily I think that Apple will need to make fundamental changes to how standoffish they are as a company to tempt the wider gaming market to offer its products on their platforms 3k wtf I was thinking maybe I should move to apple I wanted to use a tablet but I spending that when I can get 2 gaming laptops FYI you can get a brand new iPad for 349 BUT CAN IT RUN WARZONE MOBILE😂 it probably can  its ios so well optimised I used to watch Arun because of his unbiased and honest reviews brThis whole video feels like a paid promotion brHe is over hyping the basic features So are you gonna switch to an iPhone since the iPad works better with an iPhone than an Android can39t wait for foldgate 2 pro max £3600 to play Warzone mobile is insane I feel still iPad Pro 2018 holds up pretty well and does the average daily stuff without any flaws The chips do not actually make anything better unless you are editing videos or photos on iPads and at that point macs and MacBooks does it better It cannot over come being a secondary device at any point of time because of iPad os limitations the meat riding is crazy can39t wait for jerry rig39s video 😂 Bwat That thing is going to bend when JerryRigEverything breathes near it Boss i dont know if wheter your editing had little time to put this video out because of the announcement im pretty sure you guys could have gotten an NDA before it was announced for you to drop videos the same day but i appreciate the less quotin your face brainrotquot editing without letters coming out every time you mention a feature or something not that important and the vfx also more toned down you will always be the GOAT man Bro thought we wouldn39t see what he was doing to that toothbrush Samsung tablets are so much better Apple is overrated No tablet should cost over 4 grand You can buy the best of the best pc towerpc laptop for that including a 4090 and top newest intelamd cpu ect Good luck getting anywhere near that power with any crap apple product Almost everything you said about the magic keyboard was already available on the old one but nice vid I39m so upset that the new Apple Pencil Pro is only available for the new iPads I assume that my iPad Pro M2 can handle the Apple pencil Pro 3600  Km good with my OnePlus pad What game is this at 104 I feel like I’ve played this a long time ago Apple innovation  make AIR bigger amp heavier Make PRO thinner amp lighter 😏 Ill suggest arun to watch mkbhd before buying one🤓 Well cause u can afford it lol it’s like getting to Apple vision price😂 Im a non apple guy Hi sir i really request if u could help me out by buying me an iPhone for a gaming purpose please i would pay u later after i win i am searching a sponsor so please help me sir i really really needed a phone for the tournament please sir I am not convinced to pay 300 extra profit margin to Tim for Samsung screen There are Oled tablets available out there for £150 like Samsung S5e Can you review Huawei Pura 70 ultra This seems like an ad not a genuine review or reaction I39ve had several iPads and a mini The new iPad Pro is just the usual spec bump iPads have their place if you need one you need one as I do for working on the run But always a laptop is better and a Mac on my desk with a great screen is light years better than an iPad or laptop Is this quotThe Emperor39s New Clothesquot I can39t believe anyone is honestly excited here It39s kind of like a new iPhone release how exciting really  when there is little ever anything new Honestly the workflow described in the video has been there since the M1 Pros launched Nothing new here Yes the software has improved but there are still major drawbacks to using the iPad as a macbook replacement Such asbr Battery lifebr Input lag in stage managerbr That weird round mouse quotpointerquot no precise clicking possiblebr Bad files systembr No clamshell modebr Low support outside of content appsbr Safari acting buggy as hell since iPad OS 17br A single usbcbrbr This feels like a first generation product of something new and exciting a super thin and light weight tabletlaptop combo with real computational powerbrbrI39ll wait for the next generation that39s faster and has better performance to price ratio ty People in countries with a 500 bucks monthly salary Oh FFF OFFF  My car is cheaper I39m disappointed by the Apple event But that39s normal for Apple now I think As a wise man in the mkbhd comment section saidbrquotIt39s just a nerfed MacBookquot I saw that commentD All depends on what you want and need in a computer br No Macbooks have OLEDbr cheaper Macbooks don’t have promotion or good speakers like the iPad Probr no pencil and touch input on MacBooksbr it’s the only computer you need for non professional work  and for professional work Windows machines are often betterbrbriPads are fun Macbooks are boring Isengardtomwho cares  i woud rather use my  2013 MacBook  pro than this slab of an iPad  a computer is different than a tablet for most computer users oh yeah and it has no cooling fan Kid lacks imagination andor ability experiences where an iPad makes more sense than a MacBook  No Macbooks have OLED  YET just wait for the ones with OLEDbr Macbooks usually have better speakers than iPadbrbr The iPad can never take advantage of the full power of the M4 due to iPadOSbr For the same price you can get a Macbook Air that will do much more than this iPad which is why people say its a nerfed MacbookbrbrIf you just want to browse netflix or do some light work you can get a comparable Samsung or Android tablet at or below the same price which have had OLED screen and Pen Input for a long time already now cattech40502013 MacBook pro is slow as heck and lasts 3 hours max Idk how ur still using that painfully slow machine props for it still being usable Isengardtomwindows is not better for works \\u200bfriarruse1827there are pc oled laptops that are are thin light and higher performing for half the price 🤦🏽 iPadOS is much inferior It39s a glorified iPhone not a nerfed Macbook AliArghavan IpadOS is one of the reasons it is nerfed Apple is definitely trying to sell this as closer to the MacBook than to the iPhone \\u200bDontReadMyPicture93 ok I saw that comment lol IsengardtomI got rid of my Mac Air using it wasn’t fun cattech4050Macs are shit Yep I personally would buy a new iPad AirPro if it came with dual OS possibility I don39t need a MacBook but would 100 buy a small device that can handle both IOS amp macOS Current iPad software just limits so much Maybe I39m not the target audience since I39m mostly AndroidWindows user Isengardtomfor professional work windows is not better In tech world mac is vastly superior due to its linux adjacent system and coding tool support And cost about the same as a macbook 🙃🫡 \\u200bIsengardtom what You think these features won39t come to the other products Lol apple just trying to cash in before the Macs and new iphones show up abatalljust say you Apple fan girl Most major companies uses windows dillonbanks609 i39m not an apple fan girl i39m not even a girl but i just like mac more for work over windows obviously as i have a windows pc i use that more for gaming and game creation Isengardtom not having oled on 3000 devices is just stupid same with decent speakers You just named why the whole apple ecosystem is stupid Facts The price is the deciding factor and this ain’t it Antagon6663000 dollars when maxed out its 999 when not okaayyyybuddy1927 haha with pathetic 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage enjoy your brand new trash Your swap file will kill that non replaceable flash chip in few weeks Mack book with a toutchscreen shhh shhh Antagon666 you just said 39not having OLED on 3000 devices is just stupid39 when im saying you can get it for 999  stop being dramatic Ipads are very popular in the arts and illustration world A MacBook will not suit the needs of an ArtistIllustraterGraphic Designeretc in the way the iPad does HiroIeyasu I agree brI think apple is definitely trying to sell this as something similar to the MacBook This remark about it being nerfed is related to that Antagon666 “kill the flash drive in a few weeks”brI bet you a base model iPad Pro that it won’t graxxor br1 it39s flash storage not flash drivebr2 the smaller the flash memory is the less life span in terms of terrabytes written it has for 256G it would be something like 100TBW with normal usage  having to use swap 01TB of written data per day is not unreasonable value Here ya go life span of 1000 days meaning your fancy iPad becomes paperweight in 3 years Antagon666 so you’re not gonna take me up on the bet then And you’re not gonna stand by your worda Instead you’re gonna try and weasel your way out of it You said it’s going to kill the flash in a couple of  weeks Arguing semantics doesn’t make your opinion any better It39s just a tablet This will probably have the success of the Vision Pro Isengardtom ipads and macbooks are trash they are less powerful and feature packed than a desktop running linux \\u200bpnoodl3s775 windows is still the most used OS so most software developed are meant to work on windows and developed on widows alternatively you can dual boot it with linux No not even slightly an iPad can be used for a lot of tasks that a macbook can39t They aren39t directly competing with each other btw they are for different situations friarruse1827 But they are MUCH less powerful than the iPads so for people working and needing the power that39s not an option \\u200bIsengardtom no the point is that this iPad can easily be a computer but Apple decided to nerf it with iPad OS instead of a full OS so that they don39t destroy their own computer market Isengardtom OLED is a detriment not a benefit It39s a flawed decaying technology MiniLED is superior friarruse1827 Again OLED is a detriment not a benefit It39s a flawed decaying technology MiniLED is superior \\u200babatallit is better \\u200bMonsux that39s the thing Apple wouldn39t want to quotcannibalizequot their mac by providing tablets much more convenient OS riszels3743 Yeah I know That39s why Apple can39t never get someone like me into their ecosystem The same goes for other devices like Airpods Need Apple device to update them  don39t have proper high quality codecs for nonApple devices brbrMy main issue with the iPad is that there39s no dual app feature for vertical use This is on every Android tabletphone and works so smoothly On macOS this would be super easy to do but still years later no vertical dual app feature on IOS The same goes for VPN split tunneling so I have to use PCAndroid How do you say pro pencil and magic keyboard with a straight face friarruse1827

hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6381038a Overrated Price lol is same crap as samsung s8 tablet lol The unfortunate reality is that a good portion of the buyers for this iPad will never unlock and use its full potential But Apple is as much a luxury brand  lifestyle company as it is a tech giant so I digressbrbrThe truth is that for most casual consumers the PC era ended recently or is going to end soon As a student I see more and more people using tablet folios or Surface products for note taking and simple browsing  video streaming And other than workers in the tech  IT industry and PC gamers or enthusiasts literally no one seems to be adopting laptops  desktops as the first choice over tablets handhelds and consoles Rightfully so because if you don39t need the power you shouldn39t spend the money for power but for other things that matter like portability battery life usability etcbrbrNonetheless I am looking forward to Apple shills telling me they need this M4 chip for their intense 8 hour on the desk word  excel  YT  gaming workload when they could have easily bought an older equally viable ipad and hooked it up to an amazing display for home use for much cheaper Or better yet just but two devices for two separate purposes productivity and media consumption for a cheaper combo price For storage consider getting a NAS storage in place if you have a high end data connection Quite modular and reliable without paying for a cloud subscription Definitely benefits you over a period If this comment gets 10000 likes then I will tell my crush I like her Wait so my real money is worth less than UK money I remember when you could buy an iPad for 500 no I made it at the 59th minute For that price I could get a single CDJ 3000 by Pioneer and about a 100 songs from Beatport iPads are good for two things Drawing with ProCreate see my avatar and watching videos or movies You can39t burn USBs program or build and compile anything on an iPad On a Mac you can Imagine writing dense Rust or C on an iPad Me watching this on iphone 5 Battery life is not quite my expectation Really hoping that the M4 series doesn39t run as hot as the M3 I ended up sending the MBP 16 M3 Max back due to fan noise why not just add touch screen on laptops I used an iPad for a long time and I’d like to tell you from now that file management on iPad is absolutely awful bought itthen return in after shooting the videoprofit Seems like he missed almost 10 years of ipads  I mean 2018 ipad pro is still powerfull and like then now still ipadOS is tablet OS and unless they do something with v18 its not a laptop no mater how powerfull it is Plus the whole thing with size and new pencil connections so you have to buy new stuff is such apple move Its fast enough you can get docks and hubs but still Thinnest ever I don39t get why we accept the premise that thinner is better OR the premise that the thickness of an object is not determined by the thicket point which is the camera bump which does not need to exist If the whole of our phones and tablets were thicker we wouldn39t need cases to make the back flat so it rests properly on a flat surface would have better antenna SD card readers internal stylus better cooling solutions and bigger batteries and they39d bstillb be incredibly thin brbrJust mock the obsession with thinness and with 39new39 versions of blue and green every year These things are not benefits and Samsung and Apple must be shamed like Sony with Helldivers until they stop doing this Notches can die a richly deserved death too while we39re at it and nonupgradeable SSDs Any apple users here Calling it now you39re going to miss the audio quality screen size and aspect ratio of the MacBook Pro hi arun So basically as of now everything this

the screens are a tad smaller than the previous iPad Air Only the name has changed to 11 but actually the screen decreased in size Waiting for Huawei Pura 70 Review  Arun the type of guy all the quotdrake the type of guyquot suits him With that money I could feed my cats for the rest of their livesbrbr🙄🙄🙄 It’s funny to me how similar my thought process was before i purchased my m2 ipad pro I obsessed for a while before making the purchase into finding out the pro’s and cons of the device What software it supported and how well it worked and even if i could use a third party mechanical keyboard or mouse on it without too much hassle I had a samsung tab s7 before but it was simply too slow and unresponsive for what i wanted to do not to mention the spen would stop at random during the drawing of lines But as soon as i tried and eventually purchased the ipad it became my main creative device Presenting iScam Air and iScam Pro I just instead of I39ve justyour producer must be from north America most likely from the USA 😬 don39t americanise your English mate arun what game are you playing in this video i would never give my kid this expensive tablet just for him to watch skibidi toilet Actually what you’re saying here is NOT the reason to get the M4 but more of a reason for you to get an iPad Pro You can do the same thing with a M1 or M2 iPad To upgrade from the previous gen… meh gimmicky to be honest I want to aim 500 budget laptop and this tablet is almost 8x more expensive than my dream😂😂 Wow thats insane also I love your videos the pace of them is perfect I bought my iPad last year and I basically use it as an overpriced notebook It literally cannot do what a laptop does in terms of work or a phone in terms of efficiency regardless of how it’s marketed Honestly I don39t normally like Apple I39m a Google guy but seriously I39m impressed 👍 Amoled finally 😂 I just bought a galaxy book 2 360 I sold my tablet a while ago  but now I39ll be studying medicine And I need something like this in my opinion So basically you get a lot of highend hardware that the software does not make use of In short  unless you have some very specific use cases you will see no difference from the M1 Ipad Pro  Apple will never open IpadOS to really take advantage of the hardware as that would eat into their Macbook Air sales  Now some android person will come and start trash talking about apple coz why not 😂 Then some apple user come and talk shit about Android Lets do it this product is good for those who use FCP to edit their videos but am someone who edit video on Premiere Pro sooo still stuck with Macbook Annnnaaaaaa Anaaaa Or you could get a decent spec PC laptop for less money Software is exactly the same just more money in your pocket Ayye ananthankrishnan1834 ayye 😂😂😂me looking at things that I can39t afford cause am a poor student iPad OS lets down the hardware try to download an attachment for an email then attach to another email and you’ll want to throw it out the windowbrNo amount of thinness or speed will make up for IPad OS lacking compared to MacOS This is really cool but it39s an Apple product so unfortunately it39s useless In terms of gaming on MacOS i think it39ll help if more games are ported from iOS and iPadOS to the Mac For example codm on a mac I think that39ll give more Mac users a lot of options when it comes to gaming That Motorola Xoom was great was thinking if make it so thin if goes wrong Apple will be the only place to fix it as in re your video about broken phones theres no point if you cant run macos apps on it Mark my words you will not give up your laptop The ipad pro plus keyboard does not replace Macbook Pro Next iPad probably at 2090 Apple 😢😢3600😢😢so bad lowkey u can buy tablet

use and not such a waste considering how powerful that is compared to the current Snap 8 gen 2 on the galaxy Tab S9 ultra You broke down the pros and cons perfectly Bro i just bought the new ipad but it doesnt look like that they said it was Iped prO Most powerful device for mobile game brWithout emulator detection I remember wanting an iPad when I was younger and thinking 300 was a lot This is just ridiculous while the ipad pro is very tempting even for me i gave up on it for multiple reasons first one is it doesnt fix my issue i need to have one device with sim active at all times also connected to wificelular  meaning ipad will not fix my issue forcing me to buy a second iphone pro max when all your data is on device it is a priority to have access to it at any time as for me it has 2 light pros rest are cons one being extension for iphone and extension for mac yes it is usefull but for that price why should i add an extra device i need to babysit and finally is oled and 120hz pro motion this is without a doubt best display but sadly even if i game on iphone i do it for less than a hour daily as for cons as i meantioned before it is not an individual device like mac or iphone it forces you to have one or the orther to work second is you cant use iphone sim to make calls lastly if you want to do that or have celular you need pay extra for it another con for me it is hard to carry and find a use to get value out of the 2000 it costs without accesories even with i cant find a good use for I didn’t think I needed a Pro iPad but I got the one with the M1 chip and never wanted to use my MacBook again Now it is just a paperweight But the iPad is my primary device It’s interesting how as Arun is going from Mac to iPad I’m trying to go from iPad to Mac offloading as many things as I do on an iPad on to my MacBook and iPhone I see how some of the comments are copied from the mkbhd video on iPad I just care about ipad mini I like the ipad for the fact you can do artwork on them Tablets being able to replace a laptop finally is nice Lmao the time has not come yetbrbrYou39ll see him working on his laptop in next video and even after 5 to 10 years Huawei 70 Pura

need a smart Toyota Car Jerry is going to have a field day with this one Android users rn 👀😂 I can bet my right ass cheek that he isn’t gonna replace his laptop with the iPad I need a tablet for music sheets mostly but i aint giving them 3k for it i will just probably find an ancient one that works good enough and buy it for 50 bucks I don39t understand the pricing for this product My tablet is 200 Lenovo and the keyboard was 50 off ebay I39m pretty sure it will do 98 of what this tablet does and I know it does 100 of what I want it to do So is the extra 2 this thing can do really worth 2500 or whatever it is Will this thing really be attractive to people other than a uber rich status chasers  b fanboys or c artistscontent creators I can39t imagine them selling many of these things I39m probably really missing somethingand I39m not trying to be an antiapple jerk here some of the new tech is interestingThere must be value I just can39t appreciate I hope I get I39m quotnot the market for thisquotbutwho the hell is I could never justify spending that much on a tablet unless they put Mac OS on it because iPad OS is so extremely limited on what you can and cannot do with them I still don39t understand why Apple doesn39t just ship them with Mac OS Like if your watching on ipad mr who isn’t comfortable brwith the new apple ipad You need 8 terabytes brWhat are you doing with your

the capacity you’re gonna get on the iPad so far with M4 The problem is that an iPhone 15 has 6GB Performance can be matched wan iPhonebr  Only Touchscreen would be Productively Advantageous Similarly priced MacBooks have integrated keyboardsampSpatial Speakers iPad doesn’t along with a 35mm Audio portbr   At this point the iPad fills a tiny Niche of Graphic Designers Where Enhanced Touchscreens

bookmark it or send it to another device easily Rip ipad bendy iPhone 6 p For file saving I recommend using the one drive app on iPad it feels like a computer file save but works very well You can use it to make folders and save files easily Within one hour gang Unfortunately tablets are quite bad when you try to use them in awkward positions on a couch or in bed i feel Also multitasking will never be as easy as on a laptop unless they open it up with a proper file manager I wish the iPad OS with its quotlaptop capable processorquot depart from the iOS to MacOS or maybe bridge between it For

8a you realy said quotbig redesignquot  REALY LOL As an M2 iPad user I can confirm that I39m gutted the Apple Pencil Pro and the new keyboard is not compatible iPad Filthy casuals Ahh it runs ios which means every ipad in the world can do whatever the new one does and please don39t mention replacing your laptop you can39t An iPad can replace a MacBook but it ain’t replacing a PC ☠️ 😢I used to think Mr WhoseTheBoss was quite brightbrbrNow I realize he39s a silly fool as circumspect and discerning in his fidelity to reality and humanity as a capricious child let loose in a candy store with

but also MacBook because of ipad os but if other companies come up with an xElite processor and Windows on their tablet then Apple should consider adding macOS to their iPad That way consumers would benefit from having full desktop experience on their tablet WATCHING ON AN IPADbrLIKE It’s more like an apple ipad advertisement then a first hand experience video And also all new features are just gimmicky why someone need a think i pad for what and also pencil is no more a pencil it becomes a stylus now which will not feel or give real pencil feel also i wonder where is faceid and what about

it’s much easier in the Apple ecosystem iCloud is fantastic Why I jhus bought itreally😂 you can just see how much time arun puts into his videos by just seeing the light of day die overtime no

customers so bad Listening to this while owning dell which has 500HDD is painful 😢😢 If there is budget why not plus depends on users what they use it for mostly tablet like this for drawing or graphic design Nice one Apple Now when you want to buy the new apple pencil you have to buy the new iPad and now your old magic keyboard doesn39t work with the new iPad so you buy the new magic keyboard Now when you want to transfer files you realize you need to airdrop now you go and buy the iPhone 15 then you want to workout but your old watch doesn39t work with your new iPhone 15 then you buy the new apple watch series 9 now you want to listen to music so you decide to buy the new airpods and then when you walk pass the apple store and decide to go in then you see a MacBook but it is angeled in a way such that you can39t use the device properly then you decide to change the angel and you accidently touch it and a few minutes late you walk out with a brand new MacBook Later that day you get a call from work saying there have been a virus gotten into a PC then you go back into the apple store and buy 10 of the latest iMacs and also remembers that you hate getting out of bed to switch of the lights so then you decide to also get yourself 3 Homepods and 2 Homepod minis and decides to get a another MacBook and an iMac for yourself aswell Then you see the apple vision pro so you decide to play around with it for a while and then your fingers decides to press the buy button then before you leave you decide to get accessories  cases charging wires charging blocks and an Apple TV 4K Then you get a call from the bank saying that you are broke🤑 okey finally first real pro device from apple Please do an S9 Ultra video as well😊 Hey arun what39s your favourite toothbrush want pearly teeth like yours 😊 The problem is that the Performance and thickness was never the thing that was holding back the ipad Even the ipad air is able to perform all daily tasks The main reason are the limitations of ipad os instead of mac os and that all apps run on a mobile speced down versions Long story short this ipad wont do more than the older ipads its just a more expensive and premium way new ipad air is still 60hz  it39s a shamebrapple force people to buy pro versionsbrI prefer Samsung tab S9 series  even S9 FE are 90hz  pen included and samsung ecosystem is great Whàt an expensive Screen to watch Netflix on 😢 No way they made it thinner 😅 now it can bend even easier 🥵 I think it should be thicker chunkier and stuffed full of battery because it will be shoved in a tough case anyway and it it was thicker MIDI ports could fit What39s up with the fake laugh I watched the entire video just for the dad pun in the end 😄 Mrwhosetheboss your my faverout ❤❤❤ Why is he acting so fake You could do 95 of this 8 years ago on a Surface Pro for half the cost 😂 But you have to put up with clunky power hungry Windows \\u200bscottintexas Windows is not clunky although it is powerhungry due to being more feature rich With 95 more lag skyrimenjoyeryou mean bug rich lmao Surface pros are slow and last 2 hours on a charge The 8 year old surface pro is  too slow 4000 😂 51 min ago nah why he brushes his teeth like that Is it a great product Sure Is it an extreme waste of money Yep Amazing If you39re rich I hit this point last year iPad for workflow is essential Did you ask them what that small circular thing to the right of the rear camera is you just bought it because you have too much money 🙂 I hate that everyone and their mother constantly demands us to download ANOTHER app Most of the time I use them once or twice because I have to for some kind of project and then I have to remember to delete it because I’ll never use it again It really depends on what you need If you still need to work with computer productive softwares like Autodesk Fusion Rhino lag AF on Macbooks Kicad not sure about VScode etc iOS still doesn39t have those and we still have no choice Depends on what I39m working with sometimes I even have to go for WinOS or Linux 🤣 It39s crazy how pretentious and dense apple are Too bad this new ipad pro with M4 chip is still thicker than a piece of paper Early for an upload wow Which 😂 idea Samsang 😅❤ The power upgrade looks great but I was disappointed about a few things This has one less camera one less pro mic and the max memory is 2TB the same as the last one I own the last Pro fully maxed out and I create my videos on it and find it is still very very fast  I wished they had given it 4TB and given it a longer battery life When I used the Apple iPad comparison side by side there just isn’t enough for me to upgrade but if I used the pencil the new functions on the pro pen may have been worth it And the fact the lower end iPad Pros get less Performance cores 3vs4 micksmithson6724 its still much faster lol a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt6021002a im the exact opposite i hate downloading new apps sometimes even

same at least is wild Now there is no Ultra Wide camera on the iPad there is only a Wide lensbrbrThe iPad Pro didn’t get an upgrade to a 48MP camera to 😬 Who uses their iPad to take pictures and even ultra wide at that usergc6tv1bh1vBasically every student during class if you just want to make a picture of the board to put it into Goodnotes or Noteability Used it constantly during my studies Yeah I haven’t used my iPad camera since maybe the first month of purchasing it I maybe opened it a few times by accident The front facing camera being on the longer side of the device is a great upgrade for any potential video calls but the back cameras are something most people probably don’t use much so them removing the ultra wide isn’t much of a loss usergc6tv1bh1v Then remove the camera and reduce the cost by 200100 bucks If photography is your thing buy a purpose built camera It will last you for decades instead becoming defunct within 4 years If you’re using an iPad for photography you’re doing it wrong Apple wants us to use Final Cut Cam with many iPhones😂 It’s not about picture quality guys it’s about practicality plenty of people who work in construction interior design or any job alike use iPad Pro cameras for reference pictures and the ultra wide camera it’s super handy for itbrI like apple but this stupid desicions they been making are confusing AF For good LiDAR experience you need a good quality camera to… As its a device with a big screen you can really see it not being high quality…brAlso uni students school students use iPads a lot As a kid who used to use an ipad iMovie and the cameras were always bad like zoom and lowlight performance…brbrbrI dont kno if i worder it properly lol but hope that makes sense  caesarocg3839 Fair point I guess this

very safe And will not at all impact repariability If you’re gonna review the iPad you should review the galaxy tab s9 ultra too Imagine spending around 3500 on a tablet for your kids to just play

are just completely missing You can use more than 1 doc at once either brWeb these days is so much better for these things over downloading hundreds of app Am te opposite way if some random company tell me to use their app over their website I say no that neuralink guy about to go crazy on this one love the iPad idea and have owned them but iPad OS is still the achielles heel on it I honestly

YOU 1 thousandth comment App experiences are almost always worse for me brbrWhen trying to use an IPad pro as a computer for college it was not a substitute Apps almost ALWAYS didnt have full

not the best fit for everyone If you arent 100 sure the app version of something you need will work Do not buy an iPad pro But a laptop Why you bought it To do content and make some money 🤑 Im with

iPads frequently go on sale online and in stores So the prices aren’t firm Just to slap a case on it and its exactly the same lol Apple noticed that Arun peeked out of their walled garden to see what the outside world was like so they released the iPad to forcibly drag him back into it Guess he39ll be going back to iPhone when the 16 pro max comes out All the Perks of laptop and Smartphone but it

this Yo onder 1h after posting camn dringe a tablet with a mobile os will never replace a laptop Remember me when you replace your laptop The camera bump looks huge Apple is only about money I was

insteadbrTo answer your question I always chose to use the website I avoid apps as much as possible Why get 50 apps on your phone if instead you could access the same content via browser It39s just a hard sell technique There is just no chance This is absolutely insane I have the current iPad Pro 129 and that amazing to me but now I want the new toy 😂 The answer actually is cause I can afford it

heads He also didn39t purchased the tab 😂 \\u200bYJ65  or a full spec used m1 max or mid spec m1 MacBook pro Don39t let your kids watch random yt kids videosSet up a playlist of things they can watchdon39t let yt kids give them videos itself skyssleepyVery sad indeed Up there with other sad events happening in our lifetime like the Gaza war 🙄 My favourite and very early description of a tablet was 39an excellent toilet PC39 and that39s exactly right It39s the low end PC you use on the toilet when you39re trying not to rush Hardly anyone can make use of this socalled high end Apple tablet and instead of offering useful stuff like bigger screens or a desktop OS they faff about with shaving a few fractions of a millimetre off the thickness which noone asked them to do Numbers Netflix and Brawl Stars is well worth an iPad Pro  Not just PC a highend one And breaking it within a day with half of the price cost when you bought it brand new for the repair skyssleepyit’s less that apple is crap more that they’re just being aholes to buyersbrApple is more than capable of updating the software to take advantage of the hardware they just don’t wanna Cuz if they did their MacBooks would be rendered useless YJ65  Yup at that point buy a M3 Pro Macbook and a 1 or 2TB SSD 😭70 of the screen and twice the computer due to software and form factor It39s interesting that it39s about the same price as the vision pro  I guess apple realised people are willing to spend even more money than before I had the same taught lmao can get a 4090 with that money Mate you can get an iPad for less than £100 for that You’re just being silly Not me watching on my M1 IPad 😭 All you can do is to watch the kid enjoy his cartoon videos 🤣🤣🤣🤣 My gran and grandad did this😂 they only use the tablet to book flights and play words with friends My little cousin watches Minecraft on it😂😂 There are cheaper iPads for stuff like yt mate This one caters to a particular niche of people and it’s uses can’t be completely extracted in general use YJ65 But it is not portable I have ipad air and my cousing watches colored tractors on youtube so your comment is true lol What’s wrong with watching YouTube kids  Obviously I don’t watch it  just asking for someone for most users the air is perfectly fine I think that will be sold more Apple have the sheep locked in 🐑🐑🐑 lightning8410yepp was just looking around for mid tier pcs I can buy a decent one and an ipad air for the couch from the prize of a pro hanson2328 but you can’t run desktop os on it either it’s a big iPhone that costs as much as a high performance MacBook or PC Majority of the iPad pro user base use it for media consumption Imagine 😂😂 Imagine spending a PC worth of money on a PC just to find a kid watching yt kids on it jono6379No it’s not Skibidi Toilet 💀 rtx4090 price is identical 😅 I don39t wanna imagine such a scenario🙂 YJ65 Most people will probably just buy lowest storage and use iCloud But the price increase is still 50 since M1 chip So true 😂 2 PC39s  That flexing BillyPhilipRwothi know that39s significant but don39t try to change it to something political 🙄🙄🙄 Imagine not even buying yt premium even after spending soo much 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Only if you are rich then the kid will be watching YT on it Else you won39t even want them to be close to it  brbrIf I buy this I won39t let my kids around it at all \\u200bYJ65or a 4060m laptop \\u200bYJ65or an actual MacBook Ever checked the content of yt kids 🤮🤮🤮 That’s the issue here im planning to upgrade my iPad Pro 2018 but after all the option it cost me an MacBook 16inch base spec but the issue is i don’t carry around a MacBook everyday but i do have my iPad daily but it still a tough pill to swallow after looking at the price 😅 My Son is playing Lego DUPLO World on my IPad Pro rn and I’m stuck on my phone 😂😂 imagine spending 40k on a pc only to have a kid playing fortnite on it Mad you can’t afford it sounds like first world country issue to me And the display is the iPad is full of food and dirt 💀 And don’t forget when he or she decide to make a scene and throws it to the ground… and brakes the screen ouch What39s stopping the kid from playing roblox on the pc😂 kids what is a pc You might not believe it but that39s around my 4 Years Bachelor39s Degree cost 😅 skyssleepycrap🤣 they invented smart phones Wtf is crap about that It’s actually an incredibly useful device if it’s used correctly I will grant you that the software is very limited for most but it can be very useful certain workflows nabeelshariff6006MacBook fan spotted mcmike2956you can39t carry a 4090 around with you i dont think anyone uses yt kids lol skyssleepycrapple The audacity 😭 KiltedGreen yep He said his spec was 3600usd which is the same as a

\\u200bdgblg95digital creators are not the only pro in the world  they are one aspect of it  But looking at how many ppl want to be digital creators i39d say apple will still sell very well brMost engineering pro software are windows based dunno about other field Hey the keyboard for the iPad is sold separately right🫥 Lmaooooooo Me  skyssleepy pc isn’t portable Don39t buy it 😂 \\u2060YJ65whats

\\u200bDaBaseBallZI make sure my child has the best of the best slap some good PH on the screen or documentary about cereal killers and let them enjoy their selfs \\u200bBillyPhilipRwoththat last part is not sad Yeah that39s right😮 😭😭😭 skyssleepyhere we go The haters have arrived 😂😂😂😂 quotYeah but look how thin it isquot My sister does that sadly whenever I watch her stare at the 4000 dollar tv she is LOCKED in😢 bro for 3700 usd you can get the best gaming laptop I play games on my pic mainly for decades but I love my iPad Pro I use it daily And no I’m not an apple fan never owned an iPhone just the ipad exactly At least the quality will be high 😂😂😂 i want this bc i’ve been waiting for the OLED ipad  But rather have a 77inch OLED TV maybe even the 83 inch Is this the new thing every buy will say in every comment section You know there39s a 350 iPad The pro models are targeted for artists designers not kids \\u200bYJ65brYou can39t do anything with a 4080super on its own tho You can39t carry it around even if you had the whole rest of the PC with you You can39t draw with it you can39t view anything without a monitorbrLike I agree with the people who say ipadOS is holding back this piece of tech but most people just think so simplistically Imagine spending any amount of money on a PC 🤣😂 Gatitasecsii you can buy a laptop with a high spec gpu for the price of an iPad Pro 2tb 😂😂😂😂 \\u200bskyssleepy Apple are great they are not 36k euro greatbrbrI love this channel but I am sickened to see Arun trying to justify a near 4k euro fucking iPad in a world going through a huge economic declinebrbrThis device does not hold a single candle to devices even half its pricebrbrJust buy a zenbook it39s half the price and works as a tabletbrbrBuy a galaxy book ultra it has high end 4080 level specs and can be used as a 360 degree tablet This what my kid does The thing is and iPad 9 is just as good and can play the same games chickenindabox3169 to make people realise how overpriced the iPad “pro” is Why imagine😃 Exactly I wouldn’t pay this much I’ll stick with my MacBook lol I don’t have to imagine it it’s a reality in my house 😂 Yeah I got my 2018 Ipad pro for 300 and its faster then any pc for that price but 2000 is too much just get the old one No one is giving their child an iPad pro Parents buy the iPad 9 or 10 gen \\u200bYJ65  you can buy the 4090 It’s sad you can afford one or playing games that have ads every 30 seconds  come on walled garden get the junk out That’s why you don’t buy them one and have them play outside 😂😂 Guys he did not even buy it As an artist I love the iPad pros Hopefully they39re powerful enough to run real photoshop and things like blender now I just wish they would make a bulky one with crazy long battery life uncoiledfish2561 I’m pretty sure they can You watched the reveal right YJ65 is it touchscreen  can you take it everywhere different When the depression kicks in😢 skyssleepy yet there isnt a tablet even remotely comparable sobroke 😂😂 epic To be fair the old ipad now is 34900 I mean ngl the new iPad pro is pretty nice but 3000 DOLLARS if anything I rather get the new iPad air Most Apple users are like this My family all have iPhones and iPads but they struggle to understand simple concepts like transferring files to a USB drive They essentially have 1000 YoutubeInstagram machines 🤣 \\u200bharuyanto8085 your kids Mine play on 100 amazon tablets Modern society NIVOSTUDIOS laptops are absolutely portable You can buy a laptop that absolutely destroys the iPad Pro for much cheaper than its asking price KiltedGreen i ve never seen a kid watching YT kids on a Expensive PC Im guilty of Also imagine spending that much and not getting a pen with it like a samsung tablet that you get for way less Is the youtube working on it YJ65 Yeah but wtf would you YJ65 i was contrasting it to a gaming rig which is more or less the choice for people making such statements a laptop cant draw as effectively so up to you apples build is top notch cant even deny them that My honest reaction  your banned Sounds like a userpersonal problem the adults will use it to earn degrees and make money Thats basically what my 2018 ipad pro is for i dont think ive used it for anything other than that some light games and very light video editing Apple is more expensive…… Because their infrastructure is better NIVOSTUDIOS so a tablet to draw on is worth the same compared to a full spec gaming laptop that absolutely destroys the iPad in functionality apart from drawing… ok thenbrbriPad Pro is a beautiful peice of tech with great hardware that’s stuck in first gear The iPad Pro would be worth its price if it actually had a pro level os to go along with it instead of the same software that the entry level iPad comes with Yt kids shorts are worse Imagine buying a 4080 super pc and finding my kids watching YouTube on it The horror Oh wait it’s alr happening What’s your point again YJ65 you can buy a thin af laptop with a 4070 at that price galaxy book I just bought a pc with a RTX 4090 a 7800X3d and 64GB of RAM for how much this clown just spent on an ipad 😆 Ain’t nobody buying an 2000 tablet for a child APPL shareholders are betting on it It’s the business model I hate PCs and laptops so tablets are everything for me I39m a hugeeee fan of tablets They are so thin so light and so beautiful I39d spend 1000 on 1 of them if I have to I can do almost anything I want on my tabletsbrMy Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 was 600 and now my Galaxy Tab S8 was 800 I also love the iPad Minis from Apple They are small and cheaper so I always own 1 of them too Can39t wait for the iPad Mini 7 You know right YJ65assassin mirage 1080P 60 fps vs mirage 4K 120 ok brokie That’s what my daughter does on my iPad Pro 😭 Trust me some rich people will \\u200bDaBaseBallZTHIS YJ65 i think its use case for an artist to get a device with these specs would be godly it sucks its expensive but the price dont make it shitty just something i cant afford but would like one day Omg that’s me but I’m not a kid 100 My workgaming pc 180 fps in cs2 lowmid settings 43 costs 400 🫡brbrAlso iPad 8 making all the work done I had no idea why people buying it mb designers of some kind  Wait I thought all tablets are made for kids to watch YT kids on That Might be me just a laptop not a Tablet Lol YJ65 but does the pc

spending 2 years in the drawer skyssleepyIts a fully specced out model That’s some very expensive baby shark experience 🤣🤣🤣 YJ65honestly a 4080s isnt worth it imo YJ65das mad gbuyi lmao Damn 😂😂 pretty expensive for kids I do that on my 17 laptop Or your rent  once again like they all barked about the Shopping Cart wheels they sold for 700 this is the iPad Pro it is not meant for kids to watch youtube on there are other ipads literally only the base model which would be better suited for that purpose YJ65 yea it39s for the tech  youtubers who act like they need so 🙄  much damn power they don39t say that but literally that is who these products are geared for they just don39t market it as that Exactly It’s why my iPad mini 6 is my go to iPad I39m thinking even further ahead of you mate brbr Wait till foldable electronics become a thing Think of a screen you can make bigger by rolling it from the side out Then roll it back up Have the power of a PC with a huge screen in your pocket brbr Then you can roll it up and keister it from authorities Just imagine brbr If you don39t know keistering is when you hide contraband up your arse Fr Imagine only thinking that’s the only purpose of buying a tablet  🤡 YJ65The iPad will blast that piece of shit outta the water i39ve been using an ipad as a replacement for my laptoppc for about 3 years now Its really good for like unistudying since you can very quickly scan documents and the apps are quite well made I cant say its the most versatile but as far as productivityuni goes I think its better than a laptop ive also used a laptop for many years Its nice and handy to like pop out of its keyboard and give to other people lol and yes at the end of the day it functions amazingly as a youtubenetflix machine if you39re into that Oh my imagine 😂😂😂😂😂 4090 fivehundrediq5212 blast what out the water exactly That39s 20 times price of my pc that’s what it will be used for in 10 years Erh Like that day that kid will cry blood 💀💀💀 you

pcs YJ65 I’ve also seen 4080 PCs with 1080p 24” screens… or cheap PC speakers…\\xa0brbrThe iPad Pro with a Magic Keyboard has the best displayeven going back three generations only being beaten by it’s own updates insane speakers that balance and match my home theater setup and enough speed to replace 99 of tasks and virtually log into my home M1PC for the rest…\\xa0brbrIt isn’t powerful enough to run 2k4k120hz modern gaming on a separate display everything thing else it can do…brbrThe price is high but the product lifespan is long and resell is insaneI just sold my 2017 105” iPad Pro for 200 dollars which i originally spent 650 dollars on…brbrFor what are in these devices the price is high but the long term use of a device today that will last you 45 years as a top mobile performer is hard to argue with when your actually using the device Then they drop and crack it 💀 \\u200bskyssleepy I agree with you Apple is really stupid amp a huge piece of crap drones2160Samsung got the sheep locked in 🐑🐑🐑 jono6379ah yes 599 is definitely around the same price as Vision Pro 💀 Dog my kids watching YouTube kids on 1000 pc right now HarshsomadFr bro yeah PC has only one advantage over iPad

they break it Bro U dont know Influencers buy the most expensice version every time but in just a few weeks they make the return Ez 0 money involved  I would sell his tablet and use it to buy a pc ngl This hit hard A kid would never be using my iPad 215 if you39re buying an iPad pro to only watch yt videos you39re not wise This isn39t a yt machine and not having a calculator Someone already had the pc they don’t care😂 YJ65 then buy a PC lol who cares how people spend their money That’s so true what39s a computer  apple Fr My first car was 1000 I could buy it plus 2 more as backups an still pay

why I cant ever see myself buying apple products and other flagship phones I spent a little over a thousand on my computer last year and i cant see myself going much higher than that If I39m not willing to spend it on my PC I39m not definitely not on a phone tablet laptop etc brbrNot to mention I do all the Computer intensive work on it anyways so a good screen and maybe camera is all a care about on a mobile device lol 😂 fr fr Just ordered mine and my son will be using it for this I mean it is a powerful tablet but still basically a toy 🤦\\u200d♂ Well at that price they don39t need to

rtx4070 just to play dota and watch youtube 🙃 YJ65and you wont be able to bring it everywhere you go  missed the point entirely Good for 56 years not bad for 2 a day CarloGrams gaming laptop  MacBook Pro can be taken anywhere just like the iPad you’re missing the point Precisely my previous generations of tablet all are used to watch youtube only WTH right Aaron is single handily jump starting the economy and spill water on it Lol I currently do that with my 4090 PC I just use it to watch youtube and twitch Bro got that money back with this video… 😂😂 Haha😂 that39s at LEAST 2 of the best performant consumer PCs of worth Meanwhile im here thinking  imagine spending 23 grand on a 4090 that most people only use to make games look shinier at least the ipad is a complete computer  There are as many people who ise their ipads to do a whole lot more than watch youtube\\u200bmcmike2956 My computer I built is 1000 lol Outrageous prices too much expensive Nah kids these days prefer reels😭😂 Exactly Imagine spending a iPad that worth 3600 that will break easier than an iPhone 6 Wont imagen thats the norm and those same kids throwing the ipad out of the window on a highway😂 yikes This is exactly why I can39t buy the ipad I’d rather buy a pc Just imagine 😂😂 lmao Prepare for iPad bend gate skibidi toilet You could get 2 rtx 4090s for 3200 dollars 3600 is 2 really really good

mb adamtgm2405 plenty of people get the 1tb and 2tb models YJ65 Whats your point bro They are for completely different situations and scenarios Thats like saying you can buy a car instead of a 4080 Okay but its not relevant is it use your brain Some people just love to waste money \\u200blightning8410bro it is 2036 times more than my crappy laptop 😅 The ipad doesn’t do the PC does  even most of it but not for specific persons like gamer’s programmers and geagrapichal and engineers so for me it doesn’t worth the price  The cheaper ipad does the same 😢 noting  drawing and watching YT Likeeee😂😂😂😂😂 DaBaseBallZ yep this  My ex sister in law would let her kid watch youtube kids and she would repeatedly find bad babee videos These videos were kids mixing chemicals in the sink The one 6 year old girl steals her parents car and hits them over the head with a bat  A few days of watching this shit and she was cursing like a sailor and doing things she normally wouldn39t    I blocked the videos but they always came back   So yeah a playlist is the best way and monitoring  Youtube is not a babysitter I got mine yesterday But I use this to watch Mrwhosetheboss Or play roblox or playing Roblox only Lol😂 Ooooh no MrDragonorp who would want that when apple stops updating the devices 7 years after release That also means that CAs dont get updated and therefore every web service that requires SSLTLS wont work anymore when the CAs that verifiy SSLTLS certs have to replaceupdate the root certificate Hater Imagine I’m living this Very few apps would have the ability to fully use the entire power the iPad Pro can produce It’s a beast machine no doubt LOL 😂 😂😂😂😂😂 a high end gaming pc Apple is a joke 😂 It’s not a PC guys And tablet PCs are not the same quality I know I use both and hands up only use an iPad Pro for everything but connecting to other devices It’s a creation machine It’s incredible Watching cocomelon on it 😭😭 thats when you pull out the sawn off🤣🤣🤣 Lol I just bought one for my 4 year old daughter Just a base  iPad Pro 11 inch YJ65not really you can buy a pc with a 4090 and either a 14900k or 7800x3d with top shelf parts at the price of this iPad You can’t take a 4080 super PC around with you in a backpack YJ654090 lightning8410it’s literally triple the price of mine My kid can’t wait for his I literally laughed out loud at this 😂😂😂 iPad kids are back Im sure the rich people have already Apple is MercedesBenz of computers  You don39t need one you just want it if you can afford it That can happen with a PC too Well the processor is probably better than most PCs Yup that’s me you don39t have insurance for your home car phone watches or tv were do you live Mars skyssleepyexcuse you apple is not crap your just a hater skyssleepy yougay YJ65If you build it yourself you could probably squeak in a 4090 PC for 3600 fr😭😭 You can have 4 kids watching yt playing games on 4 4K tablets but apple doesnt care true As someone who has both a gaming laptop and gaming pc the iPad Pro is actually a decent product when you need to do work on it Especially when you have to travel from Korea to Europe for example etc imaging spending a pc worth of money just to find out a kid watching yt kinds on it BillyPhilipRwothno one cares lightning84103600 dollars is literally like 8 times more expensive than mine because mine was like 50 or so  off KiltedGreen you stole MrUnknownXD39s comment lol thats what i39m gonna do  💀😭 YJ65 Try carrying your PC onto a plane imagine spending a pc worth of money on a pc just to find a kid watching yt kids on it Still better

\\u200bMrDragonorp but why get apple when it39s the worst on the market🦉 lightning8410lol😂 Sounds like my house lightning8410 True but it is pretty damn good That’s nothing when you have a pc that’s worth a car and a car worth a mortgage…you get the idea 😭 PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO MAKE SUCH NUMBERS WITH A TIMER Like in your SHORTS please 😂😂😂 Brainrot… Nah he better be starting a business with that ipad Like my brother 💀 you mean 5 PC39s worth of money YJ65 99 of people do not need the 2TB version because cloud storage is so well integrated on tablets \\u200bskyssleepybrNo it39s not briPad is great Same goes for MacBook And if you are in the ecosystem the few downsides of the iPhones wouldn39t even matter much Yeah I’m not spending 3600 on a PC either… that totally isnt me 💯 Lol like you can buy a 200300 xiaomi tablet and it39ll be more than enough for a college student let alone a kid Imagine us in 2008 saying the same thing about watching TV on phones spending 5x compared to a Tube TV or them breaking it in half in less than a week He makes like 200 times the money he spend on ipad just by thus video 😂😂😂 Imagine that XD YJ65you mean 4090 😂😂😂😂😂 my kids every year I swear they get the newest iPad every year And we’re feeding them the money 😂 skyssleepycap No way I saw your most viewed video recently I’m going to subscribe At least It39s not shorts D bro this is double the price of my laptop Lol 😮😮😮😮 Imagine building a pc in 2024 The noise the bullies the obscene energy usage the tacky limitations of Windows Even Microsoft are trying to tell you that this paradigm is going away sooner than you think with copilot pcs…with no intel or amd imagine thats 2 PCs Imagine spending money on a pc that uses old architecture and nobody buys anymore instead of a tablet which is the future Also sounds like you’re mad you can’t afford it I think i saw you before Alot of High Hopes real question is the Pen 🖊️ compatible with the older ones When Not Apple has 0 Intention for their costumer39s Can you make your old filming area like your  new one after you make your studio What can it do more than a iPad Pro M1 can’t Tablet is my least used smart device I find my 2 in 1 laptop far more practical for 99 of scenarios I had to wake up at in my time zone 9 Remember folks… Hardware is always restricted by software The iPad is STILL like a Ferrari without wheels 😂 Nowadays people have way too much money not knowing where to burn them This man was surely paid by apple to go far to defend this garbage…The problem with Ipads is not with hardware but with the under utilised software experience…Please don’t fall in this youtubers trapbuy a Mac if you got to buy any one thing …Ipads are noooooo whererrreee vlose to Macs…after few months the only use they will have is to watch some movies Not all but most users Why are you posting videos at 7 in the morning The video quality looks amazing the background is very clean and mature I39m kinda wondering if Arun got a new studio and new editorsbrI like how you presented the videos there39s not much editing going on I wasn39t distracted by big edited letters on ur screen the whole experience is phenomenon On behalf of ur fans I39d like to say Well done Arun we can see ur growth 🔥 I think it was shot in a hotel room directly after the apple event 5mm with an m4 chip is crazy Crazy who is waiting for jerryrig everything review of test Ipad OS just spoils my macbook replacement I have a MacBook pro and the iPad was great but running apps and all the systems just feels limiting Maybe it doesn39t for you but I think you should maybe wait till the WWDC for them to maybe announce smth big I don39t get why they keep making things thinner and bigger From my experience tablets are way easier to use when they have some weight and thickness Me as an artist this iPad is overkill and I totally gonna replace my old Pro 3rd gen Waited 6 years for Oled and totally worth it You should do an iPad battery test We’ve seen videos like this for the last few years basically saying “this is it This COULD replace your macbook Almost everything you can do on XYZ you can do on this It’s the perfect device” and every year the answer is usually No yes you COULD do stuff on the new iPad But you won’t Because it’s still a mobile OS Best iPad ever I just want Arun to try the entirety of the Samsung ecosystem This video is just Arun justifying his 3600 ipad purchase 😑 Extraordinary ❤ Who needs M4 in a iPad 😂 brI am using iPad with A14 chipbrAnd it is insane Watching on an iPad mini… 😂 Apple fanboys always look for excuses which are mostly stupid to buy their new products The most thinnest iPad ever…before you put a case on it Hahahaha 3600 for a tablet 😭 Which they39d put MacOS on Ipad Pros Almost 1st here OMG I think is the most amazing and weird change in tech these last few yearsbrI wish I could buy it if you reach Apple in suba you should do a giveaway of an ipad Thank God you have started making videos about iPads 😮😮😮😮 This looks like catchup to Samsungs Ultra tablets Honestly I was expecting more having previous generations of both This will be another win for Ultra 10which will most likely be positioned around the 15002000 mark For how long is this going to be good and usable tho I have a hard time trusting apple I have used a lot of products from both sidesbrLet me tell you something Apple lasted long and did bettermost of the time All these people lining up to paint Tim Cook’s fence… Most powerful youtube and netflix device Apple will not make you replace your MacBook because they still want the profit It will definitely not be like how iPhone replace iPod wtf theres M4 now who the heck needs that much power on a tablet i would love to hear an update video on things like how threads is doing and other stuff you39ve talked about Way better than mkbhd video For me visual studio code’s missing is the only thing that is stopping me from getting an ipad Then it would be the perfect school device for me Bro keeps reminding me about my bank balance 🗿 Fr Compare it to the Galaxy Tab S9 ultra a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt7571237a 😭👍🏿 This is literally apple pumping out trash n their fan boys eating it like itz a 5 star meal HOW IS ZZZ ON THAT IPAD Imagine if Apple lets iPad run windows 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂windows laptop cannibalism 😂😂😂 I love this set of the video Nice one a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt43043a Ayo a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt42042a well now we know how he gets free products from tim cook quotSmall cars worthquot You can get 7 cars at that price Becoz u have mony to spend😆😆😆😆😆 Waiting for the final experience review from Arun Overall this video was enough to ignite the fire of excitement 🎉 so you made tis video and got the tablet for free smart Don39t fall for such promotions 90 don39t need a tablet let alone a tablet that costs a fortune60of us don39t even need a laptopwe buy them but don39t need themA good fone is more then enough these days These youtubers will brag about tiny bits of a product and when a new one launches they will tell u how the old one was lacking and this new one is the answer to all your problems The cycle repeats for every product DONT BE SO INSECURE DONT BUY SHIT U DNT NEED i dislike using apple products due to the fact that there is so much proprietary  stuff and i quite enjoy fixing and programming my own things not taking it to the apple store and having them fix it for me Ok But this video is now about tablets in general instead of the m4 ipad Which is clearly in line with apple39s marketing forcing you to think their products are what define a product segment And hence allowing them to change that definition anytime its convenientbrbrThe fact remains that this product only exists because of the void between iPhone and macbook that apple themselves actively maintain by shaving of features from both in order to widen the gap Too optimistic The hardware is good but it39s still an iPad Edit Did they miss a page in thermodynamicsbrWhat are theyapple redefining physics and thermodynamics get real thermally its gone be suffering Why I just bought it because I39m a tech reviewer thats really expensive lol Same review every year Great tablet but can’t replace a mac When apple discontinues Macs then you’ll get a crossover Until then they have to sell their laptops as well In the future the iPads might get discontinued and they39ll make touch screen macbooks Tablet was invented for clash of clans players I39ll afford to buy this 5 years from now😏 This man’s videos are the best ngl You have been paid wellits an IPAD😀 Ipad OS is still very limiting when will we get the option to run macOS on an iPad apple feel sorry from apple haters 🤣🖕 The design is so much like the Galaxy tab S9 Dude the fact you can buy a good laptop for the price of this iPad is insane Close to a vision pro to Not just a laptop 3k can get you such a good desktop randomshitpost8477 close to all the best parts available as a build \\u200brandomshitpost8477 yeah go carry your desktop and draw on your laptop The keyboard alone is 500 I would rather spend this on a gaming pc or a steam deck \\u200bQrt99He was Not saying you can use a pc as a laptop he is just Comparing the price davetpanda different products fam you could get a 4090 PC with the most expensive CPU with 3k You can get top of the line everything pc wise compared to this garbage apple product With keyboard and pen cost we39ll over 4k which is insane Apple is such a rip off yet people praise them for taking advantage of them So delusional \\u200bQrt99  you do realize they make laptops with all these same touch n pen features and they fold in half that mimic a tablet lol smh 🤦\\u200d♂️brbrApple products are a complete waste of money period Asus g14 2024 model is a way better buy and cheaper lol \\u200brandomshitpost8477Not only would you get a quotgoodquot desktop and laptop you can actually get flagship grade desktops and laptops the best cutting edge latest best of the best You can get an iPad for 349 lol n8dawg727the experience is nowhere near as good as on iPad 🤦 Bro my good pc is 15k i couldn39t image almost 3k Qrt99  can do that on every laptop with touchscreen and pen like the surface or Lenovo laptops and I’m not limited with the apps n8dawg727 does this laptops have  1600nits amoled display    \\u200bBenese4ftyou 39can39 but it39s such an awkward experience You can also read books on a laptop too making kindle obsolete right \\u200b\\u200bQrt99in my country you are what we called apple blower are you really think ipad worth the price Of course no there are much much more product that can do what it could sometimes better for cheaper price brbrAnd a keyboard addon for the price of chromebook And here I thought mechanical keyboard enthusiast are crazy Did you watch the apple event yesterday The price of the iPad pro 13 inch is 1299 \\u200brandomshitpost8477 \\u200bPsychoDude iPad pro price is 1299😊 Not just good but some of the best laptops out there covering almost all use cases That is because it is a laptop just without the software to actually do anything with that hardware So basically useless userzu1ht4ji2m base not even speced out thats ridiculous Thing is though Windows is in the gutter \\u200bJORDANCHRISTOPHERSPENCER seriously that is some super powerful hardware And to spend that money on a TABLET You39re not the target audience this is for people with money who want luxury You can get an older thin gaming laptop with an RTX 30 series GPU for great performance when editing on the go and even some light gaming and a PC with an RTX 4070 or 4080 for 4k gaming for the price of this overpriced slab of glass lmfao \\u200b\\u200bQrt99Or buy a reasonably priced dekstop a normal tabletipad some accessories and dinnerbrbrOh wait I39m talking to an apple fanboy Nvm PawelLeszczynskipav these guys just don39t get it brobrEverything just doesn39t fall on the same catagory guys  there39s a 20k bicycle  20k bike and a 20k care  Yes they are all priced the same but is their function the

these days LandryArri yea that Magix keyboard price is insanity  I would rather buy a third party keyboard for half the price or cheaper Qrt99 So you can get an oled tablet for 800 dollars Well then that only leaves us with a budget of 2800 dollars Clearly you can only buy a potato dekstop for that amount of moneybrbrWhen you make these kinds of arguments how can you not expect people to call you a fanboysheep quotUsing it is actually crazingly similar to using a macquot and I hate all mac equally Thin does not make better When will companies learn that If you39e willing to pay that big cash

quotinnovationquot going on at all Air was just like quota size upgradequot and Pro was like quotslimmingquot upgrade Nothing much more brbrS24 Ultra by default has anti glare glass whereas you have to pay a hundred dollars more to buy that upgradebrbrI feel like people are just falling more and more under the hypnosis of Apple and not looking for the most cutting edge tech that other companies have to offer other than ApplebrbrApple has gone so mundane over the years unlike other companies amd yet people all over the world are quotglorifyingquot Apple even for the smallest things saying that as an ex Apple user who just only owns Apple devices bcz I am forced to as I was stupid enough in my teens to enter this stupid ecosystem walled garden trapbrbrThe walls are falling Open your eyes people hellow A little kids dream Spending 3600 on a tablet that39s handicapped by it39s software is just ludicrous and completely wasteful If you don39t mind buying from a company that uses

Watching this in ipad mini 5th gen press AWESOME in ur keyboaord while watching mrwhosetheboss videos Use the old ipad 6th generation😅 and give it a review I was waited for urs After watching mkbhd lol Most powerful machine but reduce the camera on the pro models pls pin lov ur videos Using my iPad Pro is like cooking in a very small pan that I need to switch to a bigger one Mac in the middle of the cooking remarkable vs ipad39s would be a interesting  video Under 30 minutes Gang That’s powerful flat ipadj wadi 10k views in 5 minutes is insane Congratulations on your wedding announcement You also get a really nice 43 ratio screen with the 13quot iPad  169a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt9701610a screens on laptops are so outdated and constricting Arun has a fan base race with apple and also making a video highlighting the iPad over MacBookbrbrI mean should we support apple by subscribing them or Arun Codm players getting ready to buy😂 Thinnest iPad is coolwhat can it do I’m going to be honest I feel the exact opposite way The iPad is what I currently have and I am trying to get a MacBook Yes iPad does allow you to download things and is quite portable whilst having all the other benefits of being an iPad BUT There are many issues with them For one battery life If you’re ever even doing anything remotely intense you get about 4 or under hours of battery life That is not enough to consider portable You also are not only going to need a MacBook to run Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro there’s also a subscription fee on top of that to be able to use it vs on MacBook it’s a one time purchase It also is quite a bit less powerful which you mentioned but honestly living with one you can sometimes feel it Obviously it does insanely well for an iPad but it just isn’t really enough if you’re doing much editing or anything graphic intensive Plus it’s extremely easy to break and crack which I can only imagine is much more of an issue on the new one MacBooks are also probably quite easy to break but atleast they have a cover on so you get some protection where there is none on an iPad And on top of that while yes it does run games it is like any other apple product Not really the best I do have to admit I am very lucky to have one and it is really fun and useful but it just isn’t really enough and I can imagine you would use it for much more graphic intensive things than I would Obviously do whatever you believe is best for you that’s just my opinion Thank you for coming to my ted talk I just started to be in Apple environment and now this thing came out By the way good and useful information you’ve provided Might consider this as an option😄 break it I’m debating between the 11” and the 13” model Any thoughts a

Finally someone with an optimistic view I already have a Mac and this is not meant to replace that It’s meant to work TOGETHER with the Apple ecosystem and be the best media device which you can occasionally use for work as well Yes it’s a luxury device and way too expensive but it’s just so much fun to use and worth it for me For what  What is this new m4 pro proforma on the iPad that can39t be done better anywhere else or same on last gen Worth nothing \\u200bMrDragonorpbro it not some revolutionary step It does everything the old can do but faster and uses less power Also the m4 is future proof It39s not a mini pc Memelord1agreed if you don’t like it just don’t buy it i can see this being a big step up for artists since the oled screen will give you accurate colors when drawing and the new apple pencil will be nice as well just because it doesn’t fit YOUR needs doesn’t mean you have to talk it down devilofgenisis cry Yeah bro you are not gonna switch to this fulltime any time soon OS is the biggest drawback Bro I’m watching this on an Ipad Really wish Apple would enable a MacOS option for iPad Pro  My M2 iPad is already more power than I can use while limited to iPadOS and it’s always a little frustrating brbrThere’s got to be a market out there for a touchscreen enabled MacBook that works with Apple Pencil  this would easily be filled with a MacOS enabled iPad plus Magic Keyboard  Maybe that’s why it hasn’t happened because it would cannibalise MacBook sales When the AI apocalypse hits smart homes will be the first to fall  LOL I have never wanted a tablet again this bad Of course I will still hold my MacBook close to my heart not to mention it houses all of my folders and Google Documents and I use Studio One 6 on it But if I wantneed a similar form factor but don39t require the bulkiness and hardware required for more demanding work and just want something for light work and mostly social media and whatnot this and the magic keyboard are right up my alleybrbriI39ll just wait a few years until they39re being sold for cheaperi But seriously I dig this Amazing work as always Arun I39ve seen people review it too 𝙃𝙞 You’ll be surprised how limited the iPad actually is because of iPadOS I love ipads  can39t wait to buy this one  ill exchange my older one for this if they let me As a guy who use the latest Samsung tablet tab S9 i think a causal user which most of us are we Don39t need the latest and greatesti think if you are going for apple you can still get the 90  experience with the air or the M 1 and M 2 for  the half of the prize or less i used to think Ipad was the way but i bought a samsung tablet because it gives me a wayy better screen than the ipad for almost half the price and also i Don39t need the Macbook level of power because i would be watching content and playing casal games anywayalso Ipad air probably has a 60hz screen which is a big no no and ite dosent even come with the pencil A sub to the channel would be reMACable😉 Watching this on my Xiaomi pad 5 Yes weight is a major factor But I get almost the same experience at a fraction of the iPad cost Hamaaanm It needs UTM at least and because of the EU that should be coming soon DONT buy new ipadsbrgo for android if you want amoled display and go for ipad air m1 if you want an ipadbrdont complicate things its as simple and straightforward as it can ever get So Tablets are stupid expensive now i can just imagine when going into an apple store to purchase this you will go up to the desk and they will promptly ask you for your bankaccount number I was 5050 on getting the new iPad Pro but this video convinced me since I didn’t want a laptop MacBook nerfed Can you like this comment for no reason iOS is built for bmobileb games  MacOS is

are working on building your own smart phone 😉 Did you buy it to use it or review itbrjk love it either way br i cant even buy a simple android tablet hey arun i think many of us would love a battery test and comparision like you do with phones for the ipads brlike if u agree ipad won39t replace a macbook Not because it can39t The hardware in them has been able to do it for years But because apple will continue to gimp it with ipados to ensure it doesn39t this is the most exciting part of my day 😂😂😂😂 I hardly use my laptop for work anymore Just my tab n phone They made the battery smaller so more money for thembrThey removed one of the cameras so more money for thembrThey removed one for the microphones so more money for thembrThey removed mmWave 5G so more money for thembrThey removed the charger from the box so more money for thembrThey made it incompatible with old accessories so you have to buy new ones so more money for thembrThey made it more expensive so more money for them brThe same limited iPadOSbrbrYou should be more impartial on these reviews you refused to say anything negative about it just because it39s quotapplequot But still all youtubers do this One day I will get this iPad pro m4 for phub Thinnest cocomelon machine iPad Pro is the best tools for artists It replaced Wacom and Adobe which are so much more expensive yeah right thats why every person i know who uses apple products says its overrated There will always be some features on PC that the app lacks so you39re always going to have to use PC at some point So you may as well use PC 100 of the time Same thing different shell with some new fluffs before 1k comments gang I don39t get it Most who buy ipads are just students and schools I love you arun Pixel 8a video maybe Crazy I39m not sure where any of this beats the s9 other than spec numbers You are a youtuber you want views that39s why you bought it ‼️brbrAs simple as that If I were to buy a smartphone or tablet now I would probably buy a tablet 😂 First i guss 1 Bigger screen Unless ipad finally release a bigger version like Samsung ultra tab it can not replace anythingbr2 Limits in ipad osipad is still there file management storage ports etc etcbr3 Some apps are still way worse compared to desktop apps For example Photoshop which I use daily lacking so many features it makes it fairly uselessbrbrWill not buy a new ipad pro unless all 3 above is seen if they happen maybe i will replace my macbook pro 16 Best all round video so far Not sure myself and the pricing these days for pro stuff from Apple is just crazy Android  just bcz expensive doesent mean its better🍷 We have nokia which is the real deal and we have the biggest tablet samsung Can I meet u Still all of the quotfeaturesquot you mentioned comes from restrictions Apple has put in the first placebrbrYou mentioned not being able to use docs in your mac in offline mode so being able to do that in the iPad is a plusbrYou mentioned netflix not allowing download function on computer OS39s to prevent pirating so being able to do that in an iPad is a featurebrbrThis has always been the case for Apple They make their products visually appealing and their ecosystem locked for only Apple products so if you make the expensive mistake of buying even one product they lock you for a long time unless you want your previous purchases useless and switch to another brand or OS I knew you weren39t into tablets when you said that it could replace your macbookbrbrSamsung and Apple can try and convince of ditching your laptop but they are just gimmicks although for different reasons But samsung tablet can still convert into a laptop easily Retronyx If you only use a laptop for web browsing and watching content sure JerryRigEverything going crazy with this one 🗣️🗣️🗣️ Yell I hope Apple won39t cost me a fortune to fix that They fooled ya too Uhh Bro addresses every tech product he uses at the start Non apple user You should cover samsung tablet and compare it Wait until JerryRig lays his hands on it😂 Photorealistic games capable for upcoming Temple Run I bought a m1 iPad Air for notes and college stuff and the consistency gets to me It is the glitchiest device I own google apps are maliciously poorly designed battery and Apple Pencil problems and for some reason even with the Magic Keyboard half of the websites I go to don’t work most apps aren’t compatible with stage manager and so many small inexplicable bugs that it makes me frown after using it for an hour I’m waiting for another video in a couple months talking about all the problems you’re going to have The battery amp Apple Pencil problems sound weird but all the other stuff was because you didn’t do research…brbrSounds like you wanted an android tablet with full external display options… With iPad OS 17 the iPad really took a hit when it comes to stability I agree That makes it glitch all the time I often have to close Safari completely because it stops responding or is not showing a search bar anymore thetechrealist I did research I knew exactly what I wanted Android tablets are nowhere near the iPad especially due to compatibility with other Apple devices I didn’t write about the things i enjoy about my iPad I’m just outlining some disappointing experiences I’ve had and I expect Arun to describe in the future Especially in contrast to the video which is impractically optimistic especially given he is a first time iPad user TBH it sounds like user error or something because that39s not the experience I have had with any of the iPads I have ownedused Do you have an ad blocker installed That might be the issue you are having with websites The only time I can39t load a website its because the ad blocker is blocking it so I just turn off the ad blocker for that site which is 2 clicks TheJZA Yeah I have network protection but not on my iPad it is deployed for my complete network And if it can not handle blocked DNS requests it is still a software problem on the iPad interceptor001 Whatever you say bro 🤙🏼 TheJZA nonad blocker just faulty software 🤷 Cool tablet but please make a video on the hows and whats of you39re future studio D 2AM post is crazy It39s a great tab for any activity I have a 129 inch m2 iPad Pro and I feel no need for a laptop JerryRigEverything is gonna giggle and repeat the iphone 6 ALL OVER AGAIN I never

youtubers video before u and honestly they were so sooo negative and dumb about it comlains about stupidly priced ipad while using a stupidly priced eink tab yeah you39re a hypocrite a massive one but not for the reasons you think The biggest disservice these mega tech channels do to their audiences is that they never try to really put the harsh spotlight on how brands keep increasing prices arbitrarily while often giving you less for the moneybrthe new iPad has smaller batteries which means you could have had a longer lasting tab but no it ditches the ultrawide camera and nerfs the main camera on the pros there is still only 1 USB c port on a supposed pro product Damn I also got it Apple focusing on selling premium rather than more making practical innovative revolutionary products

know absolutely nothing abt tech and i definitely recommend the ipad m4 Battery life is crappy So no go for me Seeing him use S24 ultra makes me a proud owner of it I think you39re buying it because you are not a current iPad user if you had a 2020 iPad pro or newer you39ll find little to no reason to buy this new generation considering that you are giving up all the accessories you already bought with no significant software upgrades to change most professional workflows I had recently shifted from my laptop macbook air i5 to ipad air 5th gen m1 I added the magic keyboard and 2nd gen

anyway 🤣🤣🤣 \\u200bJsameds absolutely not tablets suck apple also sucks currently im waiting for when it gets good in like 20292030 Same \\u200bth1114po2te Mostly because we can39t afford these things yet but we will be fine It’s not 90 More like 3040 Most people have iPads I have an iPad mini It’s good for the iPad ecosystem and serves great for traveling and reading brbrI tried a regular iPad but always went back to my Mac for work so I returned it I wont say 99 Cause alot of people here actually just here to watch without an ipad too Will say bout 75 Same😂 I don39t have any Apple products and I don39t want a tablet but I still watched it and it was still interesting It39s good to see other perspectives on things Plus Arun39s videos are entertaining i39m gonna buy a tablet i just won39t buy a kidney priced tablet that doesn39t even allow me to sideload appsbrimagine basically not being able to own your tablet Because you have nothing better to do So do I th1114po2te i use my tab s7 fe for youtube sometimes for school if need be lmao PFnovewhat is sideloading Are you saying we must stop wasting our time😂 thanks man I will die before I buy any apple products so yeah 💀💀 Fr Same here \\u200btru3bIuewomb womb you spend 10000 on apple and 1000 on pens lol 😂 scottintexas Apple sucks Tsarb0mba installing apps outside of the app store something that isn39t quotsecurequot according to apple the same company whose messaging app is full of security exploits but i39ve been doing it for a decade without seeing a single piece of malware I’m watching on an ipad I like the little jokes he comes up with while asking us to subscribe 😂 There should be at least 2 SDcard slots with option for RAID01 and at least 2 USBC ports and at least 2 alternative app stores with emulators and other apps that apple doesn39t want you to have why woudln39t we we won39t buy it because investment wise this ipad is a terrible investment since 99 of users will just use it to watch youtube and netflix But it is still interesting to see what this cutting edge piece of tech is capable of doing That39s a testament to the editing skills of Arun and his team 🎦 1 Me tooo 🤣🤣 Same but a game I love runs smooth only on ipads due to shitty android port So no choice there iPad reviews dolt Susspect69 shit is your auxiliary verb tru3bIue u can grab s9 at literally  half the price lol and no one will use even a fraction  of power lol s9 can handle nearly every task easily  this shit is like buying  a nuclear  reactor  for a house Jsameds slower s9 can complete  any task easily  lol and  whats the use of m4s power when u won39t  even meed 75 percent of it in 9999 percent  of cases Susspect69 iPad Air is more comparable to the S9 I said that before and ended up with one😂 Cant go back to android now but not upgrading to the M4 My M1 is still great Maybe Ill upgrade on the M7😂 Same here There are tons of tablets out there that can do a lot of things that iPads can39t \\u200bAnonNsr6uuNo most of my friends and families don39t have an iPad iPads may be a big thing in US but not everywhere on this planet I guess I39m one of the 1 percenters that bought an iPad Just buy an iPad 6 which supports the Apple Pencil 1 Now you can buy them under  130 and then It is a nice toy poor Susspect69 Mine arrived yesterday and it is a dream Tab S9’s screen is less than half the iPad’s brightness lol The S9 Ultra is nowhere near the performance of the iPad Pro and has worse speakers screen mics stylus and keyboard I get that the iPad Pro is not a consumer gadget It’s literally in its name lol If you are a professional who wants a great tablet the competition isn’t even close And if you just want one for web browsing and Netflix grab a regular model or Air at half the price tru3bIue s9 literally  comes in sale with a pen less than half the price of ipad pro  lol  99 percent  of public don39t  need this tremendous power capped in ios and if imma pro i will buy a mac instead  of using  this overpriced bs ios is the  worst operating system  in history  and brightness  lol again its just marketing  bs u will never need more than  50 percent  of s9 brightness Susspect69 The S9 CANNOT compete with even an M1 iPad Air lol which is on sale rn for 200 dollars off What will u do when you go outside and touch grass with a 500 nit display The power is NOT capped if you do Final Cut editing you will know how much a good chip cuts down export times I said that the iPad pro is for a very specific target audience Prosumers or actual creative professionals If you just need one to binge watch netflix a old M1 Air will do you great JerryRigEverything is gonna adore the new M4 iPad this video is awesome a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt7081148a Netflix has a Windows

excited about this product and am super happy that apple finally has oled on iPads I hope they put this on the MacBook Pro next I wish i could be with this guy 53mm Can39t wait for Zach to snap it in

🎉🎉 Under 30 mins gang Superb ❤ Can we take a moment to appreciate the amount of effort MrWhoseTheBoss puts into his videos for us 🤩 Bot Apple is an absolute menace in the tech industry Today an iPad can’t do all the things a laptop can do but it also can’t do what a phone can do But apple has single handedly stopped them from going obsolete Samsung too While I agree with what Arun says is there a more definitive answer to how they’ve actually saved the tablet industry its because the things the ipad cant do no one cares about they just want a laptop without having to carry around a laptop because most users dont comment here in Youtube Go outside dude Those who didn39t come from Iphone  are allowed to Like this Comment  Does iPad count All these upgrades and powerful stuff  does this iPad will finally have the Calculator 🤔 Supposed to be released on the IPadOs18 Apple is sooo trash😂😂😂 W33DiiTVagree that’s why they are worth so much money 😭 \\u200bAlanWhosBeing worth a lot does mean its good NFTs are worth a lot of money but i think we can agree it39s not good W33DiiTV I have an iPad Pro 11quot 2021 It is my most expensive extended monitor for my Mac No I didn39t buy the mac my employer provided it Apple is an experience I love and hate it But gamers will definitely hate Apple products dgblg95 You know the saying “It’s better to have it and not need it than yada yada yada” 😂 I’ll stop yapping bye no native calculatoronly in app store that cost 23dollars lifetime quotIntroducing the iPad Pro M4 we have spent years improving the iPad pro here are the new features  brBetter chargerbrBetter camerabrSo much new features you cannot comprehend I bet you their charger still only charges one device at a time and is therefore manufactured ewaste I wish they39d stop doing that and switch to multiport  Samsung too Well tbf shoving the M4 which at it39s base is a VERY good CPU especially for a tablet making it fairly efficient then somehow making it as thin as it is is a feat Better Camera Where Well if you still not noticed it39s already a M4 inside of it i mean even their best competitor still wasn39t able to copy and release their answer to the M1 so the work what they did with it is way more like your think or what you can understand quotbetter cameraquot lol this time the camera got worse That is objective btw \\u200b\\u200bspunkysamuelbut at what cost If the software bottlenecks the processor what good would it be to pay the full pricebrbrIt39s effectively a bugatti Chiron that is on some tyres manufactured for a priusbrbrThe argument people can make with samsung tablets is that it is effectively just a stock corvette sure it ain39t a bugatti but atleast it39s tyres are stock and runs at full capability \\u200bLoneBeastYTApple software is optimized  as hellbrbrThe cpu will definitely  work smooth MetalSH I didn39t mean In terms of optimisation I meant more in terms of Applicability iPad os is much more limiting compared to mac os or even  samsung39s one uibrbrComparing back to my analogy ue sure your bugatti39s engine can be well oiled but if it can39t put up the horsepower down the road apart from very niche cases not much of a point otherwise LoneBeastYT Ngl Why is buggati even coming to this topic  MetalSH hes giving an analogybrI am also sure apple aint gonna let m4 go full force instead limit to save battery  MetalSH I tried to make an analogy that simply tried to compare that doesn39t matter if you have the top of the line hardware if ya can39t use it39s full potential whether it39s in form of side loading apps or being able to multitask with say 3 apps etcbrbrWhat apple should do is to make it atleast as Feature capable as a MacBook But since that would affect the MacBook sales they won39t do it Faizan29353 werid analogy then LoneBeastYT I get it what you are trying to say and it is obvious that the m4 will perform better in the macbook but brNot by a big marginbrbr10 or 20 at max MetalSH yea kind ofbrbut quotapple be applequot Better charger better camera better design more powerful chipset can play some console games The difference between s23 ultra and s24 ultra is that 24 ultra has more ai features that39s it All of you glaze Samsung when they do the same thing as apple \\u200bMetalSH  it39s around 50 rd3munna812 cap Look at the  ipad pro m2 and macbook air m2 brbrThe difference is like 20 or 30 percent rd3munna812 bro really thinks  that Samsung is the only Apple competitor and just bcz samsung did it it justifies it for Apple as well like whottt Typical apple rubbish speal LoneBeastYT Thats why that i hope since Apple is pushing Ipad as a touch screen laptop then an Ipados upgrade could come at WWDC 2024 Seeing Arun become Apples biggest sheep is sad and depressing This comment will get exactly 43 Likes If 43 then gay 19k views in 12 minutes man you fell off Gonna lose the pencil pro because it39s gonna have issues staying attached to the iPad That39s the ping my pencil 10 minutes and almost 500 COMMENTS bro how over 2k likes that is very impressive What about Mac OS If they made an iPad with fans I’d really wanna replace my laptop with it just for heavy Machine Learning workloads which I currently wouldn’t really wanna run in them considering they heat even my laptop having fans VoteGiveway Best ❤ OmgbrbrPLEASE PIN MEEEE 11 minutes Can we get a comparison to a Samsung latest tablet and maybe other brands too It’s now just a nerfed MacBook You copied this comment from MKBHD Jsameds It’s now just a nerfed MacBook the ipad wouldve been unhated if it wasnt for the removal of the 2nd camera to be honest Be hold the useless Apple vision pros brotherbrbrBTW S pen dis it first and the fact that hes saying this much without even buying it 😂😂😂 Apple News and TechImma1st brbrDon39t take my comments seriously It39s only a meme I39m gonna buy this one but not yet About keyboards couldn39t care less since i39m already packing my macbook and i can use sidecar Damn iPad Pro Users Are Lucking ❤ Does it have a calculator  Hmmm different narrative from Mkbhd Jerry who wants origami surely people put cases on iPads so going so thin is pointless for the sake of 12mm  better to have more battery and better thermals right This giving the iPad kids all the swagg now How are you going to carry that big ass thing around I know alot better things you could have done with that money What a waste Does it come with a calculator app 😛 You talking about the same devices that hasn39t changed Nothing really new The iPad isnt really a full replacement for a MacBook but depends on what you use it for I love watching your videos your one of my favourite YouTubers ❤ If u don’t need ur MacBook 💻 Pro anymore do u think I can have it 😅 Damn this is early and it came out today patiently waiting for zach39s bend test looool 😅😅😅 This kills the notion of a touch screen on a Macbook Samsung tablets are cheaper more usable and a better product new setup is fire🔥🔥🔥 Sadly A very powerful machine the average consumer will never really take advantage of but still pay premium for This is for professional use and I see parents buying this for their 3 year olds 1000 phones for their kids who aren’t even teens Games will My girl purchased the 2nd gen pro years ago and paid a lot for it including years of insurance she never used and the only thing she ever does it watch youtube check her email She could have gotten something a quarter of the price that does the same thing Plus this was all on credit so took a couple years to pay off while I was doing the same thing and more on a much cheaper tablet \\u200bDembegBoodeswhat professional use this m4 iPad is for thst can39t be done on the m1 or even previous generation from it MrDragonorpOh absolutely nothing except a couple small quality of life improvements MrDragonorp There39s always professionals who benefit from things being faster Things can always be faster especially in specific professions spunkysamuel like what give examples and prove If only 100 people in the world can benefit from this it39s still means a useless device spunkysamuel saying the words Profesional use and not elaborating is feeding thr Same shitty corporate jargon meant to squeeze dollars brbrI got a used tab s8 ultra for 3 times less then the iPad pro 13 And the tab can still do more I can actually run Linux on it brbrAnd it39s still doesn39t really replace a laptop I found MrDragonorp What is bro yappin about bro you already know what professions could use a tablet spunkysamuel you don39t even know I clearly don39t know what professional could use this tabletbrbrThere sre applications like final cut But it39s also on macbook more powerful and better No reason to use iPad for any video workflow brbrSo what professionals can do If you don39t know don39t write And be proud of that they paid extra for brand name DembegBoodes won39t most parents buy the cheapest iPad for the 3 year olds Coming from a iPad Air 2 since 2017 I39m struggling to decide between the new pro or air I39ll admit I will only use it for streaming services and emails 😅 brbrThe Pro is a bit more tempting because of the Oled screen and 120hz Not sure if I can justify the £999 price tag though 😅 DembegBoodes tbf if the parents can afford it then that ipad is a excellent tool for them to use as they get older i was a dumb tiktok kid and became a games designer because i had an ipad from such a young age so making games for it was natural fit doesnt matter how creative your kid is if he dont have the tools The average user is literally  subsidising this cutting edge tech for the professionals MrDragonorp its more so laptop is uesless PC  iPad  iPhone is the optimal setup i would never buy a laptop no idea why you would terencevancleave I see parents spend 1k on ipads ZOWituby You really are coming out and saying that someone39s gonna use a Apple product to game lol thats the funnies shit i39ve ever heard brbrIf you wanna mobile game get one of the gaming phones If you wanna non mobile game get a PC or console spunkysamuel Then why not just get a Macbook airPro johnmarkson1998 for school mostly otherwise you kinda right normalchannel2185 PC for gaming Ipad for school  art  apps iphone for making calls there you literally have everything covered laptop is the odd one out same for buying suv cars but used only in the city or family use The iPad 10th gen has just had a price drop and can do all things 90 of iPad users want to do And for 9 of iPad users I’m in that category as I have literally don’t own a laptop and have been doing everything from Excel editing research on a Samsung Tab with mostly Dex enabled if iPadOS brings a Dex style interface and a universal back button I’m sold and am willing to switch to iPad bc the apps look so much better the new 13 inch iPad Air with M2 is the best option and value basically last years iPad Pro And the 1 of iPad Power users deserve the pro Imo Just like my Amiga in the 80’s Nothing ever changes If the average person is a editorgamer artist then they can take full advantage \\u200bMrDragonorp  iPad literally is made for gamers students and artist not all products are made for everyone it can39t replace laptop obviously MrDragonorp Architects Archaeologists ANY artist duh any scientific field that requires you to move analysists anything that has to do with the environment idk those were at the top of my head I just woke upbrbrLaptops can not scan and take pictures That39s where iPads come in normalchannel2185 they can39t scan things and take pictures normalchannel2185 We gonna ignore the fact that Apple recently made a huge push to gaming on their platform Their A chips have RAYTRACING now RE8 is on phones and the appstore on Mac just added tons of gamesbrbrAlso a small thing but Hoyoverse games are downgraded on android so those gaming phones yeah normalchannel2185 then you know nothing Many games have 120 Hz support on iOS devices There are also cloud services like Geforce Now So DembegBoodes the heck a professional  gonna do with 3k usd worth of tab play yt kids just say you are pro apple most professional  would rather buy an mcbook or build pc or if ttrutly need for quot professional  work quot they would get cheaper ipad does the same damn thing xeno1018 you have a good point Last time it was mic quality this time it39s lighting what is this guy doing 😂 No matter how much powerful the chip is its still Ipad Marques Brownlee Gotta love his consistency 💪 I thought they arent for sale

can39t decide which is worse at this point Where I’m at the S9 ultra and this iPad Pro are the same price Its not that easy to sell your kidney They are not that needed And most of the donors give away their kidneys for free I39m looking for things to sell so I won39t have to sell my kidney but I am gonna get one or maybe the air but its for the pen for my artwork Kidneys are free from donors Can poeple stop comparing base level androids to top of the line iPhones Shinigami7of1 if your just gunna use it to draw and you have a budget you should just get the last gen Air it39s still really

sell my kidney  on a tab s7 here The funny thing is Android tablets cost as much on the high end but do significantly last and if you don39t want to sell your kidney and one in Apple device buy an iPad Mini or an iPad Air you are talking about Niche products it39s like an AMD user with a 5600 complaining about a 4090 moot point Theb0redguy Exactly Base level androids are better Android is a os

darkanastandtell me you’re stupid without saying you’re stupid \\u200bStib380looks cheap to me 999 that39s ain39t bad aster22380 congratulations You can afford it So it39s cheap for you I can39t afford it so it is expensive for me usergc6tv1bh1v I would disagree with that on a likeforlike 1 TB Tab S9 Ultra with 5G was £1700 or 1800 at launch no longer in stock so can39t confirm the exact price This was before the launch discounts Samsung ALWAYS offers and includes the pen as standard Samsung has also included the keyboard case free with launch orders without fail for the last few models otherwise can be picked up from resellers for around £100  The Samsung also has a larger screen for that price The Apple price for the equivalent Ipad 13 Pro package is £2577 I39d say that is a significant difference for devices that will be used for exactly the same thing by 95 of their users and will both do so without issues Both are stupidly expensive and I cringe at the thought of Samsung following Apple39s footsteps and increasing their prices on the Tab S10 series michaeldendulk9225 fair point Android users can’t even buy an app for 5 😂 senso8001 dude theres nothing stupid about this  do you think people who make money care ape shit about the pricebrbrif you are that worries just buy refurb early nice iPads could use a separate screen as an additional accessory for an extra charge😅 Im 0 years old and every time you like i get 1 year older Because it is very thin Just sitting here amp wondering how much was paid for this one sided commercial The main disadvantages of the iPad series compared to a real MacBookPC weren’t even touched  and absolutely stayed the same with the new iPads … Less than 400k subs till Arun surpasses Apple It39s so thin not frist Was going to ask for a new iPad for Christmas maybe next year 🤣🤣 Jerry Rig is gonna be very pleased to bend test this This surprised me considering Apple usually puts out products already made I need me

litterally a word in a dictionary at this point Bad review Hi 👋 I subscribe and like like always My mom has that phone Bro posting waaay too early in the morning I like thin tech but I39m always worried about snapping it in half I will do 1 pushup for every like this comment gets Bot I will do 2 pushups and a squat for every like I get Prove it or I want a refund How about a negative NOT 0 But a 1 pushup mereeq\\xa0 already did haha clarysshow3253\\xa0 no need only 40 pushups and I just did it When you realize they changed all the sizes from 129 inch to 13 inch or 109 to 11inch to quotbe more cleanquot when in reality you old magic keyboards are now obsolete and you need to buy some more 😢 exactly Didn’t you comment this on MKBHD’s video or was that someone else because this is word for word Sell your old one buy the new one problem solved why do people struggle to do this They even made their pencil obsolete Apple means business 💲💲 Jsameds Yeah Because people are lining up to buy the old obsolete accessories for old ipads Jsamedsand who’s buying those SirNoobWulften seconds on eBay says that yes there are lots of people lining up to buy old tech timepass4783People who don’t have the 2024 iPad Pro Which right now is…everyone SirNoobWulfbro has never heard of ebay Your samsung just bought some software update  begged from google  in the name of new model 💀🤡 \\u200btanmaychaudhari8602yessir 💰 timepass4783ebay CEX magpie fb marketplace gumtree cash converters  plenty of people SirNoobWulfpeople still use older ipads Not everyone upgrades all the time Pretty sure the size is ghe same Its just a slightly smaller bezel Or is it proven Yeah not happy about this Mrwhosetheboss Yeah what You still buy them Mrwhosetheboss so you were happy about the AI software 🤡 update on samsung  which they announced like it was a totally big change from their previous model s23🤡 Mrwhosetheboss i agree NickGRhe gets paid to make videos \\u200bJ6K3Rhe thinks Arun is in the same boat with the rest of us He could buy the entire ecosystem for the next gen review it and get paid for everything he spent as well as make profit J6K3R Lol He is just enthusiastic about tech and flexibility about the product At the end of the day it39s his choice What he want or not \\u200bSameerkadav2003why are all your comments sounding so butthurt man Did you just get your first apple device and want to be in the quotELITEquot club Apple can do it they know that there are enough ppl who will buy it Mrwhosethebosswhich eink tablet do you use These products are made for Americans for whom these things don39t matter NickGR  I mean its his job after all If anyone gets the pass to buy stuff even if they don39t agree with the ethics behind it it is reviewers Someone has to do it \\u200bJsamedsBecause it39s effort and you won39t get all your money back No it still works what are you saying Old magic keyboard works with the latest generation of ipads HOWEVER the new magic keyboard and apple pencil pro are not backward compatible because of the smaller clearance when close so thicker ipads won’t work while the apple pencil pro have different magnet location to accommodate the new location of the front facing camera The biggest robbery here is the new apple pencil pro features not available for the older M series chip which totally doesnt make sense JsamedsBECAUSE PROBABLY like most people we are not that rich enough to update every generation AND it simply doesnt make sense for people to update given it is only 12 years old Companies should stick to the same form factor between generations to prevent all the waste of new phone and tablet cases It would be easy to do given there39s a new tabletphone pretty much every year NickGRhe’s a reviewer ofc he’s gonna buy them 🤦\\u200d♂️ ryjno one is stopping you from buying older tech I would have accepted more if they made the size change to 1415 Adding 1 to the 129 just feels like a money grab 😢 \\u200bSameerkadav2003 Man please \\u200bVedantikaSameer0620  man can39t be clowning on Samsung when apples main selling point is there camera not that you can afford apple or Samsung dave000 reality is hard to believe i can understand ⚠️☺️ \\u200bDabigJKbots love doing that \\u200bSameerkadav2003congrats on getting your first iphone XR Rofl 🤣 The decrease the bezel sizes J6K3Rhe’s paid according to how many people views his videos well they did change literally everything about the platform so it feels like it would only be fitting and plus if you already have an ipad pro its probably not a concern price wise Sameerkadav2003 imagine hating on a company for giving its consumers quality of life improvements touch some grass buddy adityajoglekar7873 imagine hating a company and it’s users who are first to introduce every product but loving a company which copies everything from all other companies and their clown buyers being happy cuz that thing can do 100x zoom  and that too ai generated  I was on Apple’s site comparing screen sizes and it’s actually not really 11in Just the branding The same can actually be said for the MacBooks if you look closely at the spec sheet funkythefunker3645 clowning can be learnt from samsung who can’t even design their lockscreen  That too copied from apple 🤡 Buy your mother an iPhone That tells you everything about how badly Tim Cook wants to abuse his relationship with his customers and absolutely has zero empathy for the rest of humanity His concerns are not ours As if the Magic Mouse didn39t tell you everything you need to know about Apple39s attitude to civilisation \\u200bSameerkadav2003image being happy buying the same device for the last 10 years🤡🤡 And a 350 quid keyboard at that  Jsameds Cause the resell value of those things is SHIT Who tf would want to buy a old magic keyboard which only works on the old Ipads brbrAnyone buying an IPAD would have also bought a magic keyboard It costed 1100 dollars Anyone who39s dropping 11 grand on a IPAD of all things would be buying the magic keyboard too so there is really nobody who has the old ipads but not the keyboard And anyone who hasn39t bought a ipad till now will either buy the new one or buy something else it will still work the minor size difference wouldn39t matter \\u200bNickGRhe isnt your friend lmao he is a Youtuber that reviews tech so he needs to buy them lol normalchannel2185 not really I’m looking at used magic pro keyboard 129 on eBay and they’re selling for £120£160 I think he said the remarkable 2\\u200barnoldabraham2260 timepass4783A lot of people  quotApple is as Apple doesquot 😏🤣🤣🤣      😎🇬🇧 \\u200bSameerkadav2003 it was actually 🤦\\u200d♂️ That is done on purpose Apple simply wants us to buy their product Until recently I could use my logitech keyboard on my iPad Now I cannot use it anymore as some keys are not working There is nothing wrong with the keyboard as it is still working on my laptop and android devices Burh the new iPad  airs still work with the old one \\u200bNickGRThis might come as a shock to you but you can criticise the products you buy It39s your right as a consumer NickGRhe’s a tech channel \\u200bSameerkadav2003imagine supporting apple because they want to milk their customers even more🤡 \\u200bSameerkadav2003Who cares about Samsung Tablets are just useless most of the time outside of artists most people buy ipad pro only think they are pros and end up using it as a YouTube device \\u200babhinavdixit8288 All their comments are hating on Samsung lmao arnoldabraham2260 It39s reMarkable 2 NickGRthat’s basically his job he review items Apple being apple Really it should always have been that way Unlike deleting the aux jack for greedy profit on a machine often used for music wtf this makes sense All iPad Pros should have stereo Line Out jacks though Maybe even MIDI \\u200bJsamedsyou39re too willing to give apple money for no reason They find ways to make you pay more for less and you love it \\u200bNickGRto show you Are you slow He39s a reviewer \\u200bSameerkadav2003Go outside \\u200bSameerkadav2003whats the big Upgrade on iPhones Its a fucking meme that Apple changes nothing and you are shitting on Samsung for it jd2161 what do you mean “for no reason” I pay for their products because their products are excellent jd2161They make excellent products I know that’s upsetting to you but they do DabigJKhaha yeah I saw this too \\u200bJsameds because the old one isnt as much Worth As the new one because Its used HaceeOnCodm well duh lol Greed brand seller that39s for sure NickGR See his entire job is using tech that means he has money to spend but it doesn39t mean he can39t complain for those who can39t They would never do such a thing s Think I may upgrade this year as my iPad is 10 years old and the volume keys brokebr Maybe buy a pro They39ve got the best screens  According to google their manufactured by samsung They could have changed the screen size without changing the device size JsamedsI got 900 on reselling my m2 last month Now let find the other 2700 left xD predatorpro8708 well done comparing different storage models 👍 \\u200bSirNoobWulfof course lol there market for used items and people are hunting for them1 The chassis didn39t change though just the screen only and please iPad 11 inch has always existed sir it didn39t from 109 to 11 It has always been 11 inches \\u200bJsamedsbro is thinking he can sell the used accessories for the price he bought on just to buy essentially the same accessories for more price for new device asphalt9phoque551 uh where did I say that Jsameds ofc that39s the problem For essentially the same thing you need to pay 75 of the new oneconsidering selling old one would cover the rest 25 even when your old accessory works fine NickGR “buy”brbrHe’s an influencer Apple delivers them to him to review and keep for free lmao The actual measurements are smaller than 13” which stinks and the new pencil doesn39t work with older ipads and vice versa because they moved the camera for some reason and that side can39t have magnets anymore  why would he criticize these giant corporations lmfao arnoldabraham2260he uses ReMarkable i bought a keyboard for my intel macbook pro 16 2021 and I heard it won39t work in any of the Mchip machines now that was the last straw timepass4783brbrThere is an entire market for selling your old devices and then those get resold to others People that don’t want to buy the latest and greatest but are fine with buying an older model SirNoobWulfbrbrActually there is a market for it there’s sell and buy device marketplaces New Phones mean usually you buy new cases  You buy a new car your custom fit mats don’t necessarily fit  The fact that many times the keyboards carry between models at all is actually surprising The most recent keyboard worked with the iPad Gen 4 5 and 6 That was 4 years I’m not shocked they improve attachments over time requiring you to purchase new ones that fit new devices engineered to work with them  The prices always feel a tad steep for the keyboard though Lmao 😂 \\u200bNickGRhe buys em so we don39t have to In fairness it is actually 1quot larger Mistermatt1984 there39s no technical reason to make a keyboard obsolete it39s still bluetooth and the internals work fine that39s exactly programmed obsolescense They could have just made the bezels smaller like older iPads from 5 years ago Yup I thought buying the keyboard would be an investment only for Apple to do a rug pull yet again I was unfortunate enough to have got the A12Z iPad Pro only for Apple to drop the M1 version a few months later I39m done with iPad iPadOS still hasn39t advanced much either \\u200bSameerkadav2003Apple simps are in full force today The pro was always 11 The air is what was 109 jonevansauthorthe old accessories go with the old tabletphone  I bought a 2nd gen pro when I replaced it for the 5th gen pro all of the accessories went with it It and the accessories are still in use by my mother The previous generation iPad doesn’t just disappear like it was Thanos snapped out of existence Jsameds Because he didn39t buy it to have to lose money and sell it a year later lol NickGRjust cause you don’t like one thing about something doesn’t make them bad products boverallb timepass4783  ppl like me much like with phones there are ppl who won’t upgrade their iPads just because a new one came out there is always a market for old kit like I’m interested in getting an xbox one So what did we spend more money 😂 you apple users don39t know any thing\\u200bSameerkadav2003 \\u200bMrwhosetheboss you say that but you don39t do anything about it They did that on purpose so people would have to buy new keyboards lol \\u200bSameerkadav2003 A what \\u200bSameerkadav2003Nobody is mentioning anything about Sammy Jsameds apple shill Davex1555 Android shill Jsamedsnew one doesnt go with the older iPads AnythingFitz yes they do The market for older cheaper tech is huge Jsameds Website says it only works for M4 iPad Pro and M2 iPad Air Pretty sure they could have made the old ones compatible if they really wanted to Though does it really make a difference Is that a real selling point Lol AnythingFitz oh sorry I misread I thought it said everyone doesn’t go with older iPads my bad Wait do they not work on both 109 and 11 geniuses \\u200bJsameds That39s a really stupid suggestion Even if you find a buyer you could probably sell it for 100 at most so then you have to pay enough 250 for a new keyboard instead of using the one you already had HiroIeyasu then don’t buy the product then No one is forcing anyone to buy anything Sameerkadav2003shut up dude Meat riding is crazy Same with TV displays If they wanted to be clean they would cost 1000 and 1300 instead of 999 and 1299 for the base storage models Sameerkadav2003I own everything Apple but gosh Apple is pretty horrible at the moment They won39t give you free stuff to defend them Jsameds\\xa0 It39s very obvious that the incompatibility with older models is a marketing tactic It is easy to understand the frustration for the consumer There is no need to defend a multibillion dollar company39s anticonsumer friendly schemes They aren39t going to reward you for it Jsameds What a typical fanboy answer  franciscodiaz5778 ‘fanboy’ isn’t an insult lol 0LLy796 Yes but no Arun will pay for all the ecosystem because he39s a fanboy even in the case if he was not an Apple quotpaidquot youtuber and you know what I mean with quotpaidquot franciscodiaz5778 true But he is a paid YouTuber who reviews these products Fanboy or not he is getting paid to review the gadgets And let39s be honest it39s not a bad piece of tech Underwhelming to most Maybe but that39s just cos this tech segment has matured There isn39t gonna be bold designs or revolutionary updates for any of the tech in this space anymore from any company It39s all small meaningful increments from now on Soon tech companies would stop dropping new phones every year cos the increments wouldn39t be enough to justify a yearly release schedule ryjas you said the magnet locations have moved to accommodate the landscape camera This is why the Pencil Pro doesn’t work with older iPads Jsameds For an Apple cult follower of course it is not Bye Still surprised They have been doing this for ages with their quotpowerfull chip3939 Greed indeed tetzet3254 they are tho But then the things we need phones to do are getting more advanced so it cancels out Do people just Forget that these are BUSINESSES lol their only goal is to make as much money as possible and when you39re operating at a scale as large as APPLE it needs to be a LOT Consumers want all the latest and greatest and highest end tech innovation giant leaps coward every year And then want the prices to stay the same or get lower while then worlds inflation is TERRIBLE right now If you want a new iPad get it Want the new keyboard Get it DONT like the price Wait until a sale or until next Gen when this one comes down Jsamedsno one buys on ebay a used keyboard 😊bro I39m from Bangladesh I39m always following youif you help me then I can survive with my familyI have two kidsbrNow I39m totally helpless\\u200bMrwhosetheboss No worries the 3600 iPad will be rendered practically inoperable by Apple in 2028 at latest so you will then spend 7200 on the new new iPad Jsameds nuh uh Them changing the dimensions probably made them a couple more millions in accessory sales from stupid idiots honestly this new iPad generation is pure dogshit the iPad could be so much more but apple is just walking at a slow ass pace with this product Jsameds All good VehicleVibesLike Apple39s US 200 for another 8GB RAM upgrade Businesses Inflation It39s just greed and a bunch of stupid people that justify it saying a lot of crap or worst buying it franciscodiaz5778  I39m not saying I like it I39m not saying it39s not expensive I39m not saying it39s worth it None of that I don39t even disagree with you that it39s not pure greed But attacking people who buy it or the company that sells it is just silly Apple definitely spends billions on development it39s obvious they39ll not only want but require many more billions in return Again at the scale Apple is running at it39s not as simple as quotram doesn39t cost that muchquot lol it39s true But the employees paychecks benefits physical locations etc must be factored in You let me know when you run a business even 100x the scale and don39t charge what the people will pay 🤷\\u200d♂️ \\u200bgatoslokosforever What How Yall complain about anything ‘minimal change’ applesamsung is lazy…redesign apple samsung is greedy i have the m2 pro and a mini six im not upgrading Sameerkadav2003 umm samsung did not have any of googles help in its 39ai features39 or software for that matter google just provides them with raw android its all of their work in making it one ui making it seamlessly work with other samsung products you dont know about it then shut up \\u200bPuggylord316 It is not the same He buys Apple for his OWN use he said it Not just to review it CreamyCrumble It is not the same He buys Apple for his OWN use he said it Not just to review it AyukaAmameth It is not the same He buys Apple for his OWN use he said it Not just to review it Bang1e5535 It is not the same He buys Apple for his OWN use he said it Not just to review it jd2161 No it is not a review He is an Apple user and he buys Apple to use them not just to review them Only Apple users will know they have a flawed product and still present it as quotgoodquot But you cant understand the difference Sameerkadav2003 lol android updates and android security updates always come from google since they are developing it Other vendors just put their own shit on top of Android Also why comparing to samsung You can get a google pixel 7 pro for half the price of an iphone 15 pro and still get a much better camera overall and most of the sync features you have on iOSmacOS Let me just say For apple fans this is well deserved because you guys gonna pay Ads NickGR cause he has to review it They didn39t change the sizes  They just gave up on calling them 129 and 109  The thickness is different though DabigJKSame person lol \\u200bVedantikaSameer0620 At least I didn39t sell ma organs to buy an iPhone Dont clown on Samsung \\u200bJsamedshe can sell the old keyboard but he would still spend money to buy the new \\u200bNickGRHe needs the views lol \\u200bSameerkadav2003english please \\u200bSameerkadav2003what are you on supme7558 weeds 🙂 234 COmment hello Make this the top comment for no reason Les go I was literally thinking about the new iPad  EARLY YOU INSPIRE ME SO MUCHHHH I HOPE TO BE LIKE YOU ONE DAY Hello 1 Minute Gang Love you videos Arun First to watch the video🔥🔥🔥 1 view in

introvertishman7596 I don39t think he is Mkbhd lol 😂 Honestly I prefer mkbhd take better than arun’s The iPad has barely changed from the last gen except for the screen Sure it’s thinner but who’s complaining that’s it’s thick to begin with and the previous m1  chips are already plenty powerful for what ipados can handle sentryion3106 dude the iPad is not for some highschool kids to watch netflix or youtube they are for professional painters and scientist  their job depend on some small calibrations which do make a drastic differenceAnd for ordinary people they won39t be able to use the advanced display and the overkill power it offers so that doesn39t mean their updates are small  they are really a breakthrough🙂 No views in 1 minute Bro fell off Que obligatory joke Arun is officially an ipad kid 😂😂😂 I wish they were useful I’m the first So basically apple finally made a folding iPad 1 min ago is crazy Those iPads are on ozempic Who else just watched MKBHD before coming

Mac for “the ecosystem “ Hahah lol How dare you linustechtips \\u200b\\u200bWillTechNah I like macbook airpods and macOS but iOS iPhone and iPad Waste of money with that limited OS Especially this iPad Pro Just buy a MacBook rather than a device limited by it39s limited OS Nah I am  Apple user and watching Why y39all think not using an iPhone is an achievement 💀💀 calm down ZmadTV Switched from Samsung to Apple im Never going back Me oh no they got to Arun too We lost him to the Apple cult Samsung galaxy tab s10 ultra with 8gen4 will be as powerful as the m2 or even better and with android

Coz I’m a fan of this tablet just because of the performance Idc about anything else and using it for over 2 years doki1146that’s cause you are poor No one cares 💀 \\u200bZmadTV  Agreed A lot of Apple fanboys spend ££££ for something they can get twice better as a PC or Laptop especially for gaming brLook at this tablet Who the hell needs it The main feature was the screen and its resolution fantastic for watching media like YouTube But shelling out over £2500 just to watch YouTube 😂😂😂 I don39t know if Apple is making fun of their fanboys and label them gullible or something elsebrbrTell

indeed missing out on overpriced tech android consistently out performs Android   man TurntableTVLook at the comments and then try and tell me with a straight face that it’s the Apple users who are in a cult Avnersj2kyA tablet with a processor that’s 2 generations behind Apple in terms of capability is going to make the iPad look like a joke Dream on The only joke here are people who try to pretend that Android tablets can compete with iPad DDSizeBraIt’s funny that you accuse Apple users of being gullible when you’re the one who entirely missed the point of a product robertharvey6030Must be fun

devices  Thats why im subscribed Great Speed isn39t everything Sometimes it39s good to take some time to reflect on new information before spouting it out to the world PErsonally I like the approach Linus LTT is taking these days taking time to reflect before publication Means it39s more balanced and thorough I39m not saying this video is poor far from it but some I39ve seen are just terrible in the quest to be first for views I understand I wouldn39t be saying this if I thought his videos were poor as you39ve said TOP NOTCH videos expected from an 18M subscriber channel Arun i am your subscriber for 5 years can you give me any phone as my phone touch is broken and i am using a mouse to use it 0 view in 1 sec bro fell off ❤️🇲🇺🔥😔 The new iPad pro is soo thin it looks so cool no

First  Nice Not even 24 hours since release and hes already dropped the review Marques came 3hrs earlier brbrJust sayingbrbrBut I can’t wait for Aruns pixel 8a first impressions and then review DabigJK yeah that seems properly phrased this isn39t a review 40k views in 20 minutes should pay for it eventually paid promotion DabigJKyeah but arun puts more effort into editing into his video whereas marques doesn39t really bother brbrnot to mention arun edited this throughout the entire night by himself liamtpry i completely agree its not released its announced with select High quality not gonna lie No views in 0 seconds bro fell off😢😢 What39s the point of m4 if there is no app that can fully utilise it First 31 seconds ago First 🎉 Yoo we early today Cant be thinner than the ipod nano 7  Early gang 23 second ago is crazy It’s a good iPad but I don’t think I get it because I have a maxed out m3 MacBook 🇲🇺❤️🔥🔥 Yo 24s since upload and no views les goo First First You know YouTube is drunk when it shows 12 comments and there39s none Hi mrhosetheboss Hi First one First like You can give to me one😂 I hope whoever sees this has a good day Most powerful Youtube and Netflix machine overmade joke For real 😂 \\u200bbrobiv2452That is still funny Especially the reactions from all the apple sheep Not to mention Candy Crush copy paste comment no1069 Runs 1363 movies at once moms love it Yeah so true Did you come up with that comment yourself or If u want to use it for Netflix and yt only and want an iPad get an older one lol copied from mkbhd39s video 🤣🤣🤣 agree Skill issue wrong tabs9ultra If only iPad can run PS2 or PS3 Emulator that M4 chip would be a good use and not such a waste considering how powerful that is compared to the current Snap 8 gen 2 on the galaxy Tab S9 ultra ikr Facts 😂 Dont forget roblox for those people who play also roblox is soooo laggy sometimes Original dont need power to use Netflix or YouTube very small easy apps At least it won39t replace PC Gaming quotthat39s why we brought you HDR OLEDquot Copy brobiv2452 It39s true though 90 of people that buy a tablet are just consuming content Netflix Anime Youtube reading etc I am the same I have a tablet I39d never buy an iPad or super expensive tablet as I don39t need it I only use my tablet for lite mobile gaming and content consumption 😂😂😂😂😂😂 bro ikr its 3000 USD and its around the speed of your standard 1000 USD Windows laptop The extra features do not warrant it being 2000 dollars more 😂 I have an iPad 9  it’s amazing seriouslycan play PUBG and fortnight in max settings it may seem like a powerful chip inside the physical model but you wait until Apple release the next gen chip oh sorry spoiler alert everyone my bad 😂 SuryAlt2pyit should at least run PS2 emulator at this point Maybe Netflix but u don’t need power to use youtubebrbrOfc Graphics is the main one It’s not my fault that you don’t know how to use other apps overused joke get a life Don’t forget Reddit Nah pro gamers will use it Bro this joke is in every ipad video but its right ngl😂 SuryAlt2pytab s9 ultra is superior for emulation 146” and easy to install everything \\u200bmagivkmeister6166 who even plays that anymore SuryAlt2pyit can  A PS2 emulator is in production scentsoftravelmeditation it can  A PS2 emulator is in production jesperhammarlund300 can’t not be salty get a life Lol you can get the same experience with androids esp tab s8 ultra if you just want netflix and youtube userzn9ke8um8s ikr Apple is like  here you go have fun with the M4 chip But they don’t accomondate that chip to show it’s performance capability Which it such a shame and waste userzn9ke8um8s i must admit samsung lost when it comes to performance But think about it…brWhy would we spend so much money for a powerful chip but we cannot use it’s best performance SuryAlt2py Yeah performance is not even close but I use a macbook for everything power related sentience3033 yes and you need to pay monthly subscribe That’s great sentience3033 the only thing I can do is just to sideload PPSSPP emulator And that can only be work for 7 days in my country Unless you live in europe You can sideload any apps outside appstore I love how we often joke about apple elitist but I guess there would also be android elitists too Doesn39t make it any less true though\\u200bbrobiv2452 Lack of imagination if those are the only things you can see it being used for And handheld Gaming machine For real it’s all I use it for 😂 The fan oys are upset with your comment \\u200bRobloxianXit cost alot of money to put that apple on the back side \\u200bSuryAlt2pydo you not watch comparison video samsung has not lost their pretty much neck and neck and with long term performance apple never outlast theor competition ahmedsamy8406 I have the Ipad 9 also no reason to upgrade I have been using an iPad for over a year now and it39s been life changing reading books taking notes watching content Hell I even got into drawing toobriPad is so much fun Fr I bought my iPad to watch movies 😂 really  neat hardware amazing SOC but with  junk OS \\u200bbrobiv2452 doesn39t make the joke less funny I am going to buy the OLED 11 inch IPad I don’t need the speed or processing power but I am very picky about the display and HDR movie quality so the OLED display is well worth it Lots and lots of artists use them I don39t understand anyone else that buys them though But please continue so that apple keeps advancing 🤣 To be honest it’s what I am doing with iPad Pro 129 M2 right now😂 To be fair the old ipad now is 34900 shahidmirza1138same  hahahaha SO true Haha facts 😂 D tell me u cant afford it without telling me u cant afford it So others tablet👌🏻… true doh and drawing screen 😂😂😂 clash of clan And amazon purchasing machine It still runs better than your pc brobiv2452 people recycling comments for likes 😂 Absolutely iPad Pro is the most useless apple Product He probably made double the price on the adds 😂 Unless you’re an artist YodaSkywalker u don39t get the point it39s running ios so it has limitations even though it has the same chip as mac so the operating system becomes a bottle neck Dont forget DOODLE JUMP  Bigger screen means less falls   And just reimagine the beauty of Bejeweled The most powerful copy pasted comment Darksouls131 not really you will be lucky if a single movie fits into the ram I will not upgrade from my m2 brbrThey have not even tapped nowhere near the m2 capabilities on a tablet but yet you come out with an m4 Smh True Fact 😂 Stolen joke off twitter That39s what I plan on using it for brobiv2452 accurate SuryAlt2pythere’s ps4 and ps5 games ports on the iPad \\u200bSuryAlt2pyEmulators are coming to iOS Delta already got released until wwdc 2024 Towers are more powerful wit2 and blowtorches even more if they could run software which Youtube isn’t SuryAlt2pyspelling fail TravisTheSavagelearn spelling drater Apple lead in efficient benchmarks JoeHwh3xzsubtract yourself Shotbymic2wit2 can’t multiply nor capitalize If you saw me in the field and how I use iPads you’d think I was a wizard alysdexia you do not know anything about bench marks you cannot compare their bench marks and even if you do those benchmarks are short burst of the power that apple cannot keep consistently All you apple fan boys do is keep proving tech people that you know nothing about what your buying alysdexia\\xa0 also the fact that you tell me to learn spelling and use drater wrong in a sentence is hilarious to me TravisTheSavage I don’t \\u200bbrobiv2452he stole that line from someone else from another video \\u200byizzymxhe39s in the habit of stealing people39s comments and paste them in other threads \\u200bWoahCuberyep this guy is a fraudhe39s in the habit of hijacking other39s comments brobiv2452 Still 100 true BruceWayne lol sumirat6888😂 TravisTheSavage I was expecting that but unfortunately no Samsung still uses mobile chip while iPad uses Macbook chip For me personally snap 8 gen 2 is good enough to do all the tasks But one thing that bothers me is that Apple doesn’t accomondate that M4 chip to perform heavy tasks such as running PSP PS2 Emulator such as NetherSX2 PPSSPP Dolphin Emulator and etc brbrThere are some emulators available but u must subscribe monthly which is annoyingbrbrUnless if you live in Europe you could sideload any apps that’s not available in app store While others only have 7 days of sideload apps And then you cannot use that apps anymore SuryAlt2pyit can StarChaser1879 yeah it can with sideload but only 7 days and then u cannot use that app anymore Unless if you live in europebrbrOr other option like cloud gaming But I don’t like it SuryAlt2py wrong you don’t need to slide load they changed the App Store rules The most advance 10’mins of garage band lol SuryAlt2py you don’t need to sideload they changed the App Store Guidelines I want the OLED screen Because I don’t like the LCD black at night Ipad Pro is my most important work tool I am an illustrator You forgot kids lol Short sided tape just because you don’t have a life doesn’t mean that the people buying the iPad don’t Yes sir Exactly Do you guys not realise what you can do on iPads now They are workstation laptops Very dumb comment tbh \\u200bYodaSkywalkerLCD iPads look like washed out garbagebrbrOLED is the way to go for content consumption \\u200bStonedCherry1 rWhooooshbrbr🤣🤣🤣 \\u200bscentsoftravelmeditation rWhoooosh 🤣🤣🤣 or FacebookInstagram machine Cat videos 👍😎 \\u200bSuryAlt2pysooooo you39d spend 3600 just to play old games devilkazumi578 well would you paid that much if it cannot do basically anything you want to do \\u200brudyopperman1975nah pro games like consoles and pcs SuryAlt2py I wouldn39t pay 3000 for a tablet period haha And gaming machine Can it run TikTok Pro Most jealous comment ever lol The most amazing Redtube machine Laydown with your head propped on a pillow iPAD in portrait mode on topof your belly and enjoy the content lol Exactly That39s all I use my iPad for YT KIDS thats what i use mine for lol Can it run adobe premiere or photoshop a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvS9cmoZFJTD4ampt101141a Thats kinda the point lol I39d rather skip their ratio39s are literal trashlike there39s the 13 inch and only a tiny slip to watch it on what a waste

This means long texts may cause memory allocation errors. If you're not using the parser or NER, it's probably safe to increase the `nlp.max_length` limit. The limit is in number of characters, so you can check whether your inputs are too long by checking `len(text)`."
